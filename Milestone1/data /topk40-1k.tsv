Tom Curran has been called up to England's Ashes squad. The 22-year-old Surrey all-rounder will fly out to Australia in the next 24 hours as a replacement for Steven Finn, after the Middlesex fast bowler was ruled out of the rest of the tour with a torn left knee cartilage. Curran is yet to play a Test match for England. However, he broke into the white-ball side during the 2017 season, making his debut in Twenty20 and one-day international cricket, and impressed the England management with his attitude. Coach Trevor Bayliss is known to be a fan, and so Curran has been preferred to the likes of Liam Plunkett, Tom Helm, George Garton and Mark Wood as England seek to bolster their ailing pace-bowling reserves ahead of the toughest series of them all.

We'll have turkey on the table Thursday but, as yet, it looks like no turkey in the Presidential on-deck circle. And both Gov. Howard Dean and Congressman Bernie Sanders think credit should go where credit is due. That means, thank you, Ralph Nader. Thanks a whole frickin' lot! Shortly after the votes were counted and the stalemate began, Dean said he hoped the Nader voters in the Sunshine State — all 93,000 — were "happy." Said he hoped they would be comfortable with the Supreme Court justices that Dubya will be appointing if he proves to be the eventual winner. Dean supported Ralph Nader's right to run, but sarcastically expressed the hope that Nader's supporters will live at peace with themselves under the looming Bush administration. And Sanders, an old friend of the Green Party candidate, was even more upset. "It seemed to me," said Ol' Bernardo, "that in the last month or two, Nader really made a deliberate effort to defeat Al Gore. He went to those states where the races were closest and was pretty clear about his goal. I don't understand that and I think that was wrong." Hindsight's always 20-20. Thanks, Ralph. Civil-Unions Update — The 11-member commission established by Act 91 met last week at the Statehouse to check up on how Vermont's landmark legalization of love for all couples was shaking out. The news was quite good. Steve Patterson, deputy commerce secretary, reported no negative repercussions whatsoever to date. While there's plenty of anecdotal information about the positive effect the more than 1200 civil unions have had on Vermont's hospitality sector, Patterson said his agency had compiled no data to quantify that. Town Clerk Linda Spence of Manchester told the commission over the speakerphone that implementation of the civil-unions law has been remarkably smooth. Vance is also a justice of the peace and the president of the Association of Town Clerks and Treasurers. She was familiar with just one case of rude treatment given an out-of-state lesbian couple by a town official in Weston. "The sun still rises and sets in Vermont," said Spence. "I myself am a heterosexual, but I have to say my experiences both as town clerk and justice of the peace have been nothing but positive with this law in place. It has proved to me to be one of the most moving and emotional pieces of legislation I have seen, and I don't see where it does any harm to anybody." We're No.1??? — University of Vermont men's ice hockey Coach Mike Gilligan told Seven Days Tuesday morning he's hanging in there. After all, the guy's a veteran of the game. A senior statesman. An institution. When Gilligan first hit Burlington, Bernie Sanders was mayor, Madeleine Kunin just got elected governor, Phish was a typo. Nobody ever heard of Bill Clinton. The lakefront bikepath did not exist. Things change. That's why we had to check Gilligan's pulse this week. At no time in his 16 years of whistling Vermont line changes has Mike Gilligan been here before. It's uncharted territory. The numbers don't lie. As the old Green & Gold prepared for Tuesday night's game against non-league opponent UMass-Amherst, Vermont is 4-0 and flying solo in first place in the ECAC. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know. It's much too early to suggest that Cinderella is spending the winter in Burlington, Vermont. Way too early. Dream on, right? But they say the darkest hour comes right before the dawn. And everybody remembers the black night that swallowed UVM last season. However, what these guys have been doing on the ice speaks volumes. "They learned quite a bit last season," Gilligan told Seven Days. "They learned how precious one game is. How precious a night on the ice is." It shows. And make no mistake, this is a disciplined team in more ways than one. Gilligan told us forward Graham Mink, a junior from Stowe, Vermont, sat out the first four games as punishment for breaking an undisclosed team rule. When he finally got to play in the Yale game, Big Mink played like a gorilla on ice skates. A couple of Minnesota schools are coming in this weekend for a Saturday-Sunday tournament at the Gut with Gilligan's Gorillas and UNH. Duluth and Mankato, in the giant Minnesota state university system, will hit Burlap with some rock-'em-sock-'em "western-style" hockey. Welcome to Vermont, boys!

The 1945 Sinkings of the Cap Arcona and the Thielbek Allied Attacks Killed Thousands of Concentration Camp Inmates By Mark Weber All prisoners of German wartime concentration camps who perished while in German custody are routinely regarded as "victims of Nazism" -- even if they lost their lives as direct or indirect result of Allied policy. Similarly, all Jews who died in German captivity during World War II -- no matter what the cause of death -- are counted as "victims of the Holocaust." This view is very misleading, if not deceitful. In fact, many tens of thousands of camp inmates and Jews lost their lives as direct and indirect victims of Allied action, or of the horrors of the Second World War. For example, the many thousands of Jews who perished in the notorious Bergen-Belsen camp during and after the final months of the war in Europe, including Anne Frank, were primarily victims not of German policy, but rather of the turmoil and chaos of war. Among the German concentration camp prisoners who perished at Allied hands were some 7,000 inmates who were killed during the war's final week as they were being evacuated in three large German ships that were attacked by British war planes. This little-known tragedy is one of history's greatest maritime disasters. The Cap Arcona, launched in May 1927, was a handsome passenger ship of the "Hamburg-South America" line. At 27,000 gross registered tons, it was the fourth-largest ship in the German merchant marine. For twelve years -- until the outbreak of war in 1939 -- she had sailed regularly between Hamburg and Rio de Janeiro. In the war's final months she was pressed into service by the German navy to rescue refugees fleeing from areas in the east threatened by the Red Army. This was part of a vast rescue operation organized by the German navy under the supervision of Grand Admiral Karl Dönitz. All but unknown in the United States today, this great undertaking saved countless lives. The Thielbek, a much smaller ship of 2,800 gross registered tons, was also used to transport refugees as part of the rescue operation. In April 1945, Karl Kaufmann, Gauleiter of Hamburg and Reich Commissioner for merchant shipping, transferred the Cap Arcona and the Thielbek from naval command, and ordered them to Neustadt Bay in the Baltic Sea near the north German city of Lübeck. Some 5,000 prisoners hastily evacuated from the Neuengamme concentration camp (a few miles southeast of Hamburg) were brought on board the Cap Arcona between April 18 and 26, along with some 400 SS guards, a naval gunnery detail of 500, and a crew of 76. Similarly the Thielbek took on some 2,800 Neuengamme prisoners. Under the terrible conditions that prevailed in what remained of unoccupied Germany during those final weeks, conditions for the prisoners on board the two vessels were dreadful. Many of the tightly packed inmates were ill, and both food and water were in very short supply. On the afternoon of May 3, 1945, British "Typhoon" fighter-bombers, striking in several attack waves, bombarded and fired on the Cap Arcona and then the Thielbek. The two ships, which had no military function or mission, were flying many large white flags. "The hoisting of white flags proved useless," notes the Encyclopedia of the Third Reich. The attacks were thus violations of international law, for which -- if Britain and not Germany had been the vanquished power -- British pilots and their commanders could have been punished and even executed as "war criminals." The Thielbek, struck by rockets, bombs and machine gun fire, sank in just 15-20 minutes. British planes then fired on terror-stricken survivors who were struggling in rescue boats or thrashing in the cold sea. Nearly everyone on board the Thielbek perished quickly, including nearly all the SS guards, ship's officers and crew members. Only about 50 of the prisoners survived. The burning Cap Arcona took longer to go under. Many inmates burned to death. Most of those who were able to leap overboard drowned in the cold sea, and only some 350-500 could be rescued. During the next several days hundreds of corpses washed up on nearby shores, and were buried in mass graves. Having sunk in shallow water, the wreck of the capsized Cap Arcona remained partially above water as a grim reminder of the catastrophe. A German reference work, Verheimlichte Dokumente, sums up: A particularly barbaric Allied war crime was the bombing on May 3, 1945, by British Royal Air Force planes of the passenger ships Cap Arcona and Thielbek in the Lübeck bay, packed with concentration camp inmates. Among the many 'nameless' victims were many prominent political figures, a fact that is hushed up today because the fact that concentration camp inmates, many of them	1
Kim Kardashian is jumping on the hype wave and releasing a fidget spinner. The spinner is a gold money symbol and it says "daddy," which is apt since it's called the Daddy Money Fidget Spinner. It can be yours — with a seven-day shipping delay because these things take time — for the low price of $15, plus $4 for shipping Fidget spinners are apparently still a thing. But since I could not give less of a shit about them, I asked my colleague and noted fidget spinner enthusiast, Ashley Carman, what she thought about Kim's latest business endeavor. "I would never spend $15 on a Kim K spinner," says Carman. Well there you have it. Have a nice weekend.	1
10 of London's greatest Victorian projects – 4. The Palace of Westminster… February 6, 2013 Commonly thought to be older than it actually is due to its Gothic stylings (although, to be fair, parts of it do date from medieval times), the Palace of Westminster – or, as it's more commonly known, the Houses of Parliament – didn't actually take on much of its current appearance until the latter half of the 19th century. The need for a new building for parliament arose after 1834 when a fire, caused by the overheating of two underfloor stoves used to incinerate the Exchequer's obsolete tally sticks, tore through the former complex, leaving only some structures from the old palace intact. They included the 11th century Westminster Hall (the largest in Europe when it was built), 14th century Jewel Tower and a chapterhouse, crypt and cloisters, all of which was once attached to the now gone St Stephen's Chapel. While King William IV offered the use of Buckingham Palace for Parliament, the idea – along with a host of other options – was rejected as unsuitable. Instead, a competition was held for a new design and after almost 100 entries were considered, architect Charles Barry and his design for a new palace in the perpendicular Gothic style was chosen. Interestingly, while Barry was a classical architect, under the terms of the competition, designs were required to be in a Gothic style, thought to embody conservative values . Incorporating some of the remains of the old palace – including Westminster Hall but not the Jewel Tower which to this day stands alone – the design was based around a series of internal courtyards with the House of Commons and House of Lords located on either side of a central lobby (first known as Octagonal Hall). The design involved reclaiming some land from the Thames so the building's main river-facing facade could be completed. Towers stand at either end of the complex – the Victoria Tower over the Sovereign's Entrance at the southern end of the complex (for many years the tallest square stone tower in the world) and the narrower tower formerly known as the Clock Tower which houses the bell Big Ben, at the northern end – and there is a central Octagonal Tower which stands directly over the Central Lobby. The Clock Tower, incidentally, was renamed the Elizabeth Tower last year in honour of Queen Elizabeth II's Diamond Jubilee (for more on it and Big Ben, see our earlier entries here and here). Other towers include the Speaker's Tower (located at the northern end of the building on the waterfront, this contains a residence for the Speaker), the Chancellor's Tower (located at the southern end, it too contained a residence originally used by the Lord Chancellor) and St Stephen's Tower – located in the middle of the building's west front, it contains the public entrance to the building. Significant other rooms in the palace complex include the Robing Room – where the Queen puts on her ceremonial robes and crown before the State Opening of Parliament – and the Royal Gallery, used for state occasions. The foundation stone (the building was constructed out of sand-coloured limestone from Yorkshire) was laid in 1840 and construction of the monumental building – which features more than 1,100 rooms and two miles of passageways – wasn't completely finished until the 1870s although most of the work had been completed by 1860 (the year Barry died). The House of Lords first sat in their new chamber in 1847 and the House of Commons in 1852 (it was at this point that Barry was knighted for his work). The cost, meanwhile, originally estimated at less than £750,000, ended up coming in at more than £2 million. Much of the interior decoration owes its appearance to the Gothic revivalist Augustus Pugin who designed everything from wallpapers, to floor tiles and furnishings. Pugin also helped Barry with the external appearance but like Barry died before the project was completely finished (in 1852). The palace was bombed numerous times in World War II – in one raid, the Commons Chamber was destroyed as firefighters opted to save the much older Westminster Hall instead. It was later rebuilt under the direction of Sir Giles Gilbert Scott and completed by 1950. Other aspects of the building have also been restored. A Grade I-listed building classified as a World Heritage Site, Barry's Houses of Parliament remain one of London's most iconic structures. We'll be looking in more detail at some of the building's features in future posts. WHERE: Houses of Parliament (nearest Tube stations are Westminster, St James's Park and Embankment); WHEN: Tours (75 minutes) are run from 9.15am to 4.30pm on Saturdays (also six days a week during summer opening); COST: £15 adults/£10 concessions/£6 children five to 15 years (children under five are free).

: This week the Chilean government's promise to protect roughly 10 million acres of land became official, boosting the nation's parklands by 38.5 percent, according to a statement . Read our original story about the move below: Last week, the government of Chile signed an agreement taking possession of a 1-million-acres of private park land put together by a pair of American philanthropists. It also announced it would protect an additional 9 million acres of wildlands as national parks, reports Jonathan Franklin at The Guardian. Kris McDivitt Tompkins, former CEO of the clothing company Patagonia and her husband, Doug Tompkins, co-founder of the North Face and Esprit clothing lines, began buying hundreds of thousands of acres in the wild Patagonia region of Chile in the early 1990s, The Guardian's John Vidal reported last year. Their goal, Vidal writes, was to "buy and restore as much land as they could, improve and protect it, and then return it to people as public, national parks." After over two decades of work, they acquired 2.2 million acres of land, including the gifted land, Parque Pumalín and Patagonia, which together span roughly 1 million acres and represent the largest land donation from a private entity to a country. But Chile was not always receptive to the couple. In the beginning of the project, they were accused of being CIA spies, of trying to hobble Chile's economic development and called a national security threat. At one point the government threatened to take their land. "We were opposed for four years. We were 'the couple who cut Chile in half,'" McDivitt Tompkins tells Vidal. "They said we were setting up a nuclear-waste dump or a new Jewish state." But in recent years, the Chilean government has warmed up to the conservation projects, and president Michelle Bachelet was on hand at the border of Pumalin Park to sign the documents authorizing the handover. As Elizabeth Royte at National Geographic reports, Chile hopes to include the new parks in a 1,500-mile tourism route they want to call the Ruta de los Parques, which would link together 17 national parks and offer everything from rainforest hikes and mountaineering to sea kayaking. By some estimates the new parks will bring $270 million into the area and employ 43,000 people. The new parks make Chile one of Central and South America's most eco-conscious nations. "That puts Chile right up there with Costa Rica in terms of the percentage of protected lands," Yvon Chouinard, founder of the Patagonia clothing company tells Franklin. "No other human has ever created this many acres of protected wildlands…These are tourist-ready parks with trails and cabins and infrastructure." However, Doug Tompkins, who died in 2015 in a kayaking accident, will never see the fruits of their labor. "I wish my husband Doug, whose vision inspired today's historic pledge, were here on this memorable day. Our team and I feel his absence deeply," McDivitt Tompkins says in a press release. "But I know that if Doug were here today, he would speak of national parks being one of the greatest expressions of democracy that a country can realize, preserving the masterpieces of a nation for all of its citizenry." The handover of the Tompkins property will take place incrementally over the next two years.	1
Household fast food names could soon be a thing of the past thanks to the funding of plant-based alternatives from some of the world's biggest investors. The plant-based food scene is changing rapidly, no longer are vegans thought to eat nothing but lettuce and lentils, the plant-based burger revolution has arrived. What's more, big investors are excited about it. Recently, Beyond Meat's burger, otherwise known as 'the burger that bleeds' accomplished something huge when they struck a deal with stores owned by Kroger, that means their burger will be stocked in 605 stores across the US. Beyond have seen investments from some big names including Bill Gates, General Mills and even meat producers Tyson Foods. Tyson's CEO said earlier this year that the future of protein may lie in the meatless market. A similar burger, made by Impossible Foods, who Bill Gates has also invested in, managed to accumulate $75 million worth of funding last month. Alongside Bill Gates, Facebook co-founder Dustin Moskovitz and Asia's second richest man Li Ka-shing were amongst the contributors. Impossible are currently waiting on confirmation from the FDA about their ingredient 'heme', which they were granted a patent for this month. Heme is the key to their 'meat like' burgers and is derived from soy. As yet the FDA are undecided as to whether this product will be considered an allergen, which is currently stopping Impossible from distributing further. However, it seems that they will have a lot of support behind them when they do. Taking it one step further, from individual products to a whole chain of restaurants, By Chloe has taken the US by storm since its first store opened its doors in 2015. The fully plant-based chain which has been described as 'Shake Shack without the meat', is already venturing across the Atlantic to London, where it will open its first European store in Covent Garden later this year. Since opening, the chain has sold over 600,000 vegan burgers, which aren't the only item on their menu. These high figures may account for the whopping $13 million dollars invested in the chain recently to allow them to expand both in the US and overseas. Start-ups like these are seeing an increase in popularity, and it's not surprising. Plant-based foods are much more sustainable than their animal product alternative, something Impossible Foods boast about on their site. The increased number of options allow people who are still keen on the taste of meat, as well as those who want to celebrate vegetables, plenty of things to try without comprising their favourite foods. With backing from big investors these companies could go from just starting out to fast food giants pretty quickly, and with everything they have to brag about it could mean a sharp decline in some of the world's biggest fast food outlets. Unless, of course, McDonalds want to jump on the plant-based bandwagon? Image credit: Impossible Foods | Beyond Meat | Grub Street | by Chloe	1
by David E. Petzal - Thursday, June 29, 2017 According to a poll by the Media Insight Project, only 6 percent of Americans have faith in the news media. Among readers of American Rifleman, that figure is likely even lower. We've learned that, in all probability, anything we read or hear about guns will be either biased or factually wrong, or both. How come? Reason One: Lack of accountability. When I broke into the magazine business in 1964, I had some basic rules drummed into my crew-cut head. If you edited a piece, you were responsible for everything in it: spelling, punctuation, facts, everything—especially facts. If you were wrong, God help you. The least you would get was a serious public tongue-lashing. As a result of this process I can tell you to this day that it's the Smithsonian Institution, not Institute, and that "prairie" is not spelled "prarie." A cousin of mine, who worked at one of the big New York City daily newspapers, had exactly the same experience. This seems to have gone by the wayside. A small example: On Jan. 5, in The New York Times, there was an article on "ballistics vests." What's wrong with this? It's "ballistic vests." "Ballistics" is the science of projectile behavior and is a noun, while "ballistic" means relating to ballistics, and is an adjective. No one at The Times appears to know the difference. If I had made that mistake, or my cousin had, we would have been screamed at for 10 minutes with no regard for our "safe space." Reason Two: People in the same profession tend to think alike. Among the news media, the collective wisdom regarding guns runs as follows: 1. They believe guns are inherently evil. 2. They think gun owners are, at the least, disturbed and, at the worst, dangerous. 3. They believe the National Rifle Association has, since its founding in 1871, done nothing worthwhile, has never been right about anything and is nothing more than a shill for the firearm industry. 4. They believe the Second Amendment has no relevance in today's United States, and if only we could institute reasonable gun controls there would be no more gun violence. 5. It is their opinion that guns in the home lead only to tragedy, and self-protection is a myth. Now, let's assume that you're a student in journalism school, and the subject of guns comes up, and you venture the fact that you own guns, and use them, and that your family has always had guns in the home, and that there's never been an accident, and that you don't even know of any accidents. How do you think that statement would be received? Most likely, you would shortly receive a summons from the dean of students and probably the college psychiatrist to come in and chat, not that there's anything wrong, you understand, but … . Or let's say that you work in a newsroom and the subject of guns used in self-defense comes up and you point out that, every month, you can cite half a dozen or more cases in "The Armed Citizen" where someone who had a gun prevented a crime or saved themselves or someone else and, in many instances, did it without firing a shot. Imagine the look you're going to get from the news director. It will not be the kind of look that says your career will prosper here. Reason Three: Good old-fashioned ignorance. I got my first exposure to this in the mid-1960s when the armed forces began issuing M16s. The 5.56 mm bullets, we were told by reporters, created terrible wounds because "they tumbled through the air and hit people like little buzz saws." "Golly gee," I said, (or words to that effect), "that's just not possible. Anything that tumbles through the air isn't going to go where it's aimed. Just look at a football that doesn't spiral." But there it was, and there was more to come. When the first Glocks were imported they were denounced as "all plastic," and therefore undetectable at airports. The media, knowing nothing of how guns work, and not understanding such concepts as mass and resistance, printed the nonsense verbatim. When the great "cop-killer-bullet" brouhaha erupted, the media also neglected to check the facts. If they had, they would have learned that Teflon-coated ammunition was very expensive, made in limited amounts, sold to police agencies only and had never been used to kill a cop. Journalists are ignorant about guns because being knowledgeable about guns requires at least a smattering of	1

Getty Images Eagles quarterback Michael Vick has heard people, including the President of the United States, call for him to slide feet first dozens of times in the last few years. If Vick played for the Vikings, he might not hear quite as much criticism of the way he ends his runs. Vikings offensive coordinator Bill Musgrave wants quarterback Christian Ponder to slide head first after he suffered a concussion on a hit by Redskins linebacker London Fletcher after a feet first slide last season. Musgrave is fine with sliding feet first when there's no one around, but he thinks Ponder gets to the ground more quickly if he leads with his head in traffic. "We don't want to expose ourselves by being a periscope up — exposing all our vital organs. We want to give them a very minimal surface," Musgrave said, via Dave Campbell of the Associated Press. Going head first isn't going to eliminate the possibility of injuries. There's the chance of a shoulder or wrist injury as you go to the turf and rules governing when defensive players hit you aren't in place when the quarterback goes head first, to say nothing of the increased risk of injury. In 2010, Eli Manning lost a fumble against the Eagles that contributed to a Giants loss in a season that ended with the Giants one game out of a playoff spot. There are risks either way, then, and the Vikings will be taking theirs head first this season.	1
What the team was looking for, in particular, were elements like thorium and uranium, which along with potassium, warm Earth's interior. This heat affects its plate tectonics and, according to the scientists, the way it retains its water. Though the functions of that heat-to-plate-to-liquid interaction aren't fully understood -- it's "one of the great mysteries in the geosciences," the study's advisor, Wendy Panero, put it -- scientists have speculated that the forces of heat convection in the mantle, the ones that move Earth's crust, have some kind of role in regulating the amount of water in the oceans. "It seems that if a planet is to retain an ocean over geologic timescales, it needs some kind of crust 'recycling system,' and for us that's mantle convection," Unterborn said. Which means, in turn, that plate tectonics could also be a key indicator of a planet's hospitality to life. Particularly for microbial life -- since microbial life on Earth, the study's authors point out, benefits from subsurface heat. (Take the single-celled microbe archaea, some of which live not off the energy of the sun, but rather off the heat rising from inside the Earth.) And that indicator, the team reasoned, can be approximated by analyzing a given exoplanet's sun: the more thorium in the star, say, the more likely a terrestrial planet formed around that star would be to support life. Since it would stand to reason that the planets that orbit around those suns contain more thorium, as well, that would suggest that the interiors of those exoplanets are warmer than ours -- and also that those planets are more geologically active than Earth. And that would mean that they are more likely than Earth to retain the liquid water that supports life. And: Of the eight solar twins the team studied, seven of them seemed to contain more thorium than our own star. One star in the team's survey, for example, contained 2.5 times more thorium than our sun. And per the study's measurements, terrestrial planets that formed around that star likely generate 25 percent more internal heat than Earth does -- with all that that implies. So there could be at least one planet that is potentially more life-affirming than Earth. But there could also be, the study suggests, more where that came from: exoplanets that are more earthly than Earth -- planets nourished and made hospitable by the warmth of other suns. Now that the hunt for exoplanets has moved from science fiction to science, that finding -- preliminary and tentative as it is -- could have implications for humans' ability to find signs of life elsewhere in the universe. As study co-author Cayman Unterborn summed it up: "If it turns out that these planets are warmer than we previously thought, then we can effectively increase the size of the habitable zone around these stars by pushing the habitable zone farther from the host star, and consider more of those planets hospitable to microbial life."	1
Backpage accounts for about 70 percent of prostitution advertising among five Web sites that carry such ads in the United States, earning more than $22 million annually from prostitution ads, according to AIM Group, a media research and consulting company. It is now the premier Web site for human trafficking in the United States, according to the National Association of Attorneys General. And it's not a fly-by-night operation. Backpage is owned by Village Voice Media, which also owns the estimable Village Voice newspaper. Photo Attorneys general from 48 states have written a joint letter to Village Voice Media, pleading with it to get out of the flesh trade. An online petition at Change.org has gathered 94,000 signatures asking Village Voice Media to stop taking prostitution advertising. Instead, the company has used The Village Voice to mock its critics. Alissa thought about using her real name for this article but decided not to for fear that Village Voice would retaliate. Court records and public officials back Alissa's account, and there is plenty of evidence that under-age girls are marketed on Backpage. Arrests in such cases have been reported in at least 22 states. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Just this month, prosecutors in New York City filed charges in a case involving a gang that allegedly locked a 15-year-old Long Island girl in an empty house, drugged her, tied her up, raped her, and advertised her on Backpage. After a week of being sold for sex, prosecutors in Queens said, the girl escaped. Liz McDougall, general counsel of Village Voice Media, told me that it is "shortsighted, ill-informed and counterproductive" to focus on Backpage when many other Web sites are also involved, particularly because Backpage tries to screen out ads for minors and reports possible trafficking cases to the authorities. McDougall denied that Backpage dominates the field and said that the Long Island girl was marketed on 13 other Web sites as well. But if street pimps go to jail for profiteering on under-age girls, should their media partners like Village Voice Media really get a pass? Paradoxically, Village Voice began as an alternative newspaper to speak truth to power. It publishes some superb journalism. So it's sad to see it accept business from pimps in the greediest and most depraved kind of exploitation. True, many prostitution ads on Backpage are placed by adult women acting on their own without coercion; they're not my concern. Other ads are placed by pimps: the Brooklyn district attorney's office says that the great majority of the sex trafficking cases it prosecutes involve girls marketed on Backpage. Video Alissa, who grew up in a troubled household in Boston, has a story that is fairly typical. She says that one night when she was 16 — and this matches the account she gave federal prosecutors — a young man approached her and told her she was attractive. She thought that he was a rapper, and she was flattered. He told her that he wanted her to be his girlfriend, she recalls wistfully. Within a few weeks, he was prostituting her — even as she continued to study as a high school sophomore. Alissa didn't run away partly because of a feeling that there was a romantic bond, partly because of Stockholm syndrome, and partly because of raw fear. She says violence was common if she tried connecting to the outside world or if she didn't meet her daily quota for cash. "He would get aggressive and strangle me and physically assault me and threaten to sell me to someone that was more violent than him, which he eventually did," Alissa recalled. She said she was sold from one pimp to another several times, for roughly $10,000 each time. Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

After a couple of years, she fled, but a pimp tracked her down and — with the women he controlled — beat and stomped Alissa, breaking her jaw and several ribs, she said. That led her to cooperate with the police. There are no simple solutions to end sex trafficking, but it would help to have public pressure on Village Voice Media to stop carrying prostitution advertising. The Film Forum has already announced that it will stop buying ads in The Village Voice. About 100 advertisers have dropped Rush Limbaugh's radio show because of	1
The 43-year-old pleaded guilty on Tuesday to two counts of using a carriage service to transmit, publish or promote child pornography. The charges carry a maximum penalty of 15 years imprisonment. An agreed statement of facts tendered to the court details graphic communications which "amount to child pornography" that were exchanged between the men on Skype. The conversations include descriptions of what the pair would like to do to children, their preferences of children as young as three including ages and physical features, and discussion of where to access videos and photos of child pornography. On May 12, 2015, McCormack - who used the screen name "oz4skinboi" and claimed to be 28 - said he couldn't wait to look at "B porn". Hundreds of texts between McCormack and another man were detailed in court documents. Photo: AAP The man responded: "I have some vids ... wbu [what about you]?" McCormack: "Some". Man: "Cool cool, pics too?" McCormack: "None saved but links." In an early morning chat on January 4, 2017, McCormack wrote: "I'm a total b loving pedo". Over the next two and a half weeks, he sent messages including "I wana get pedo with u" and "Proud ped, proud b lover" The graphic messages were intercepted by the NSW Police Child Exploitation Internet Unit. Police also obtained a 30-second video of McCormack performing a sex act, which he sent to the other man. In the video, McCormack is heard to say he perves "non stop" when he's at the beach, a shopping centre or at the movies. As the chats went on, the man speaking with McCormack called him "Ben" and later mentioned McCormack's affiliation to A Current Affair, which gave police vital clues they needed to track him down. McCormack was arrested at Moore Park on April 6, with search warrants carried out at his home and A Current Affair's offices in Willoughby. He declined a police interview. On Tuesday, a Channel Nine spokeswoman said McCormack had resigned, and that he no longer worked for the network. Following his brief appearance at Downing Centre Local Court, where he entered his guilty plea, McCormack grinned and appeared at ease, chatting to someone he recognised in the public gallery. Outside court, his lawyer Sam Macedone said McCormack never traded images of children. "I just wanted to make it quite clear that there was never any images that were traded between Ben and anyone else of any child exploitation material," Mr Macedone said.	1

On June 17 at about 13:40 I crossed the Ambassador bridge into Windsor Ontario Canada. I intended to see Rush's 2 Toronto concerts and a Blue Jays game. At customs an agent Reid was intensely interested in my electronics, in particular she was obsessed with an old VHS VCR that was in a suitcase in my trunk along with a dozen or so VHS tapes. Every bit of media, Digital and analog was taken out of my vehicle and scrutinized. Even the "timer" VCR tapes with CSI Reruns and Oprah recorded on them. After logging in to my Twitter account, and finding a "Tweet" on my laptop to the username <Girls Name Redacted> Officer Reid accused me of lying to her about knowing "<Girls Name Redacted> (I don't know her, the messages that Reid read clearly illustrated that) and demanded the password for my cell phone. At this point I asked to speak to a supervisor. This was when I spoke to Mr Mailoux, who told me that if I did not provide the password, my phone would be seized and sent to Ottawa for evaluation. He said that MacDonald believed that I was meeting a "girl of questionable age" and that all of my digital and analog media was suspect. I provided the password, there was nothing illegal on my phone, my iPod, my (now broken) tablet, my laptop, or any of the 20 or so VHS tapes that were meticulously scrutinized, and two cameras and their SD cards, which I cannot locate at the moment as my personal belongs were COMPLETELY RANSACKED and scattered inside of my vehicle! <Girls Name Redacted> gave her age as 21 on Twitter, and I had no reason to doubt her, we had only kicked around the idea of possibly meeting, and she warned me that her "social anxiety" might keep her home. So when Ms Reid asked if I knew anyone, or if I was meeting someone, my 100% honest answer was and still is "NO" Since Reid had obviously read the same messages, she knew all of this before asking, and my answers confirmed exactly what the messages said, regardless, she accused me of lying. About 45min later I was told that a "weapon" had been found in my car and that it had been seized, I could only get my car back if I paid $500. When I asked for the documents, Mr. MacDonald said that he already gave them to me. I knew this was not the case, the only place I could put the documents was in the car that was not in my possession. I was wearing swim-trunks, sandals and a pocketless T-Shirt, the documents were NOT in my possession! Only after asking for a supervisor did he provide me with "copies" of the forms. The "weapon" in question is some sort of tool, although I cannot tell you what kind. It was in a box of tools that I borrowed to repair the door handle on my car, and it got left behind after the chore was finished. I never used it, just removed it to get to another tool, and did not return it to the box of loaner tools. The replacement handles were also in the car at the time, and so was the broken one that had been replaced. The tool was in the door handle pocket with a pinball and a pack of matches, all just miscellaneous odds and ends that I found under the seats last time I vacuumed the car. It was a random piece of "junk" that wound up being put in the door handle. The item is NOT BRASS KNUCKLES, it is not brass, and there are only 2 rings on it, and they pivot from side to side I do not know what it is, I do know that it is NOT a WEAPON, and that I have never used it as a either a tool or a weapon. When I asked Mr Mailloux (the "supervisor") for his name, he said "I will get you a card" and he did, although the card had no name on it. His name was clearly on his uniform, so while there was no attempt to "hide" his identity, the card 'trick' seemed like he was trying to "pull something". Clearly there is distrust on both sides at this point. Since a don't know what the tool even is and it would be expensive to ship due to it's weight, I would simply like to appeal the $500 that was demanded to return my vehicle. What ever the tool is, as I do not know what it is, I have no use for it. What I DO have a use for is the $500 that I was forced to pay for the return of my vehicle. My arrest in 1988 was disclosed to Reid, it was 25+ years old and was dismissed. This has not been an issue my previous 3 visits to Canada. So ummmm any ideas	1
The Cleveland Browns, after an 0-2 start, are now 3-2 and atop the AFC North. With the third ranked defense entering the game, T.J. Ward's pick-six sealed the 37-24 win. In a game that showcased new kids Brian Hoyer and E.J. Manuel as starters, neither made it to the finish with undrafted rookie Jeff Tuel and estranged starter Brandon Weeden filling in after injuries. Stevie Johnson also left the game early and C.J. Spiller was on limited duty after injuring his ankle 4 days ago. However, his 8 carries were enough to flash his still-blazing speed on route to a 54 yard rushing TD. While Weeden was booed by his home crowd initially, he was able to put some scoring drives together fueled by the ultra-talented Josh Gordon and electric return-man Travis Benjamin, who had 179 punt-return yards and a TD. Everyone had pinned the Browns as tossing the season after dismissing Trent Richardson for a 1st round pick. However, his weak 3.1 YPC this season reveals more of his NFL ability than his college success and 3rd-overall draft status. With a potentially top-loaded draft in 2014, the Browns are looking sneakily clever. Now, with the Ravens struggling and the Bengals inconsistent, the Browns are in control of their division. With their next 3 games against the Lions, Packers and Chiefs, their tough defense will be severely tested as they try to hold onto a division they've never won.	1
Pro-abortion protesters outside the Supreme Court in Washington, D.C., in March. (Reuters photo: Kevin Lamarque) A strange controversy in Texas Texas has passed a regulation requiring that human corpses be disposed of in accordance with the state's regulation for the disposal of human corpses. That this exercise in tautology was necessary — and that it is controversial — is a reminder that we live in the golden age of mass delusion. Advertisement Advertisement The underlying question here, which properly understood isn't a question at all, has to do with abortion, and what it is that an abortion does. The biological answer to that question is straightforward: An abortion is a procedure in which a physician or another party kills a living human organism, either prior to birth or in the course of inducing a birth. About the three relevant criteria — 1) living, 2) human, 3) organism — there is no serious question: The tissue is living tissue, not dead tissue; it is human tissue, not rutabaga or koala bear tissue; it is arranged into an individual organism rather than an organ or a tumor or an extension of the maternal body. Because the biology is straightforward, maintaining the fiction that abortion is something other than the premeditated killing of a living human being requires a retreat into poorly wrought metaphysics. The same people who will lecture you about science eight days a week inexplicably embrace pre-modern superstitious notions of "ensoulment" and work up some fine angels-dancing-on-the-head-of-a-pin material about "personhood," the legal construction one uses when one is trying one's best not to notice that what happens in an abortion is killing and that what is killed is a distinct and individual human being. Advertisement The abortion ethic is based on a lie: that the procedure involves nothing more than the elimination of a meaningless clump of cells. That lie is bound up in a nest of lies of which it is one particularly poisonous constituent, all of which are aimed at denying the relationship between sex and procreation or at denying the deep and wide-ranging consequences of attempting to disrupt that relationship. And that larger tangle of lies is itself only a constituent of an even more sprawling mess of confusion and deceit holding that men and women are interchangeable social units, that motherhood and fatherhood are social fictions that were dreamt up rather than evolved, and that you, Sunshine, and your desires are the very center of this universe. The dead baby in the surgical tray makes all that nonsense rather hard to sustain. Advertisement Advertisement Texas governor Greg Abbott approved a proposal yesterday that would forbid treating the bodies of the dead like used bandages or other medical waste, instead requiring that they be cremated or buried. The burials, if they come to pass, will be surreal affairs. What would one say? Would the mother attend? The rule does not apply to miscarriages or to "abortions that take place at home," presumably a reference to pharmaceutically induced abortions. Yes, the Texas rule is transparent: It is a transparent attempt to force Texans to face reality. The abortion lobby is apoplectic, which is what it always is, which must get exhausting. NARAL Pro-Choice Texas protests that the move is a "transparent" attempt to burden abortionists. "The rules target physicians that provide abortions and the hospitals that care for patients," says Blake Rocap, the lawyer for the group. "Transparent" is a funny choice of word: NARAL is an organization that refuses even to say its own name — it is formerly the National Abortion Rights Action League — or to acknowledge what sort of "choice" it is advocating. Yes, the Texas rule is transparent: It is a transparent attempt to force Texans to face reality. Advertisement Advertisement It probably will not prevent (at least not directly) a single abortion from taking place, and, though the particulars of their condition is unknowable, it seems unlikely that a grave or a dignified cremation will make the victims feel any better about having had their lives snuffed out before they had had a chance to take a breath, much less to take a step or fall in love. The dead, Private Joker informs us, know only one thing: that it is better to be alive — though Christians, who in one month will celebrate the Feast of the Holy Innocents, take a different view. Whichever story is closer to the truth, death is death is death. But our children are not garbage. Not the living ones, and not the dead, as resolute as their parents may be in treating them as though they were. Reality will not be denied. Not for very long. Not in Texas. Not anywhere.	1

Luzerne County officials investigating complaints by voters who chose a straight-party Republican ticket that Hillary Clinton's name was on their ballot, Nov. 8, 2016. (WBRE/WYOU Staff Photo) WILKES BARRE, LUZERNE COUNTY (WBRE/WYOU) - Luzerne County elections officials were scrambling Tuesday after receiving a barrage of complaints about the county's electronic voting machine turning Republican votes for Donald Trump to votes for Hillary Clinton. Eyewitness News was the first to report the problem early Tuesday morning after more than a score of voters contacted us saying that when they checked the straight-party Republican ticket option on their voting machine all the GOP candidates were checked - except Trump. Instead, Hillary Clinton's name appeared as their selection. "If you click on Republican," says "Becky", a Dallas voter. "Hillary was automatically picked and moved to the next screen. I went back to change it and it wouldn't let me. I had to have someone come over and reset my scree. She said that it happened to someone earlier." "I now believe that this is rigged!", she wrote Eyewitness News. "My concern is I was smart enough to realize that after making three separate attempts to try to complete my ballot," says Lorraine of Pittston Township "the machine was trying to cast it for me. I stopped and called for help." Election officials initially told us that they had received no word of the problem, then conceded about an hour later there was a problem. "We've gotten several calls," Luzerne County Election Bureau Solicitor Mike Butera told us just before 11:00 a.m.. Initially, they said the problems appeared to be related to "voter error" "We sent technicians to every polling place where we received a complaint. We found no vote flipping at all. We have found some machine glitches, which were fixed." While the problem seemed most troublesome in the Butler Township, Drums and Rock Glen precincts, it soon began appearing elsewhere around the county. Eyewitness News has learned the problem appears to be more widespread, however, with the same "glitch" being reported in Columbia, Carbon and Monroe Counties and in other parts of central Pennsylvania. Elections officials say in each case they've been made aware of, the voter was able to cast an accurate vote for the candidate of their choice - saying there was no "vote flipping" occurring at the polling stations. Luzerne County Bureau of Elections Director Marissa Crispell says initially there appeared to be a calibration problem with some machines. "You might select a straight Democrat party ticket, and it would send you to the Green party. It was an obvious problem, which was easily fixed when brought to the attention of poll workers." Officials also indicated some of the problem might be due to "voter error" as many voters aren't familiar with the wide variety of electronic voting machines being used in Pennsylvania. The problems in Luzerne County are indicative of the suspicion many voters have in the outcome of the 2016 election, especially the presidential race between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. Trump has campaigned for weeks on what he's called a "rigged election". Earlier in the day, Pennsylvania Secretary of State Pedro Cortes dismissed Trump's allegations, telling Eyewitness News during a live interview from the state capitol in Harrisburg that Pennsylvania has a good, secure voting system. "It is unfortunate that it has been some of the talk of this election, he said. "Pennsylvania has a very good history of running elections that are fair, that are smooth, that you can trust. Elections are not perfect, but they are legitimate and there's no basis to substantiate those claims. It's important for voters to know that our machines in Pennsylvania are not connected to the internet, they're not even connected to each other."	1
Deep-sea diving tank combined with injections of a patient's own stem cells to treat diabetes  Sitting in a diving chamber may be a new treatment for type 2 diabetes, the most common form of the condition.  Scientists are combining the treatment with injections of a patient's own stem cells in a bid to kick-start insulin production.  They believe the high levels of oxygen in the chamber boosts the activity of the stem cells, helping them to repair the cells in the body that produce insulin.  There are around 2.9 million Britons with diabetes, with most of them suffering from type 2 In a new trial, patients with type 2 diabetes reduced their need for insulin and metformin (a common diabetes drug) with some no longer needing the insulin at all.  So-called hyperbaric oxygen therapy involves a patient sitting in a pressurised chamber.  The high-pressure atmosphere means they breathe in three times as much oxygen as they would normally.  The treatment is normally used for helping divers who have surfaced too quickly and have the 'bends' (where bubbles of nitrogen form in the blood).  It's also used for carbon monoxide poisoning and to speed up wound healing such as leg ulcers. Studies suggest high levels of oxygen boosts activity of stem cells — the so-called blank slate cells that can turn into any cell of the body — helping them to replace and heal ailing cells.  A study at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine showed that a course of hyperbaric oxygen treatment triggers an eight-fold increase in the number of circulating stem cells, possibly by boosting the activity of enzymes involved in the release and activity of stem cells.  The new treatment involves scientists extracting a patient's stem cells, multiplying them in the lab and then injecting them back into the pancreas (this organ produces the hormone insulin, which mops up blood sugar).  Combining this treatment with the oxygen chamber increases the activity of the stem cells, boosting their healing powers.  In some cases, it is possible to control symptoms through lifestyle changes, such as a healthy diet Patients receive injections of their own stem cells into the pancreas before and after entering the diving chamber.  There are around 2.9 million Britons with diabetes, with most of them suffering from type 2, where not enough insulin is produced to maintain a normal blood sugar level, or the cells of the body become resistant to its effect.  Diabetes cannot be cured, but there are treatments that aim to keep blood glucose levels as normal as possible to control symptoms and lower the risk of complications.  In some cases, it is possible to control symptoms through lifestyle changes, such as a healthy diet.  But drugs such as metformin (which reduces glucose production by the liver) or injected therapies such as insulin may become necessary.  The new treatment, which is being investigated at a number of centres across the world, involves extracting stem cells from the patient's bone marrow under local anaesthetic and injecting them into the pancreas.  In a trial at Miami University, 25 patients had five hour-long sessions of hyperbaric oxygen treatment before and after the injections, over the course of a week.  All the patients were taking either metformin or insulin, or both.  Four patients were able to stop using their insulin after the combined treatment. Fifteen of the patients could gradually reduce their insulin over the following year, while ten stopped or reduced their metformin dose, it was reported in the journal Cell Transplantation.  Commenting on the use of stem cells in diabetes research, Dr Matthew Hobbs, Diabetes UK Head of Research, said: 'Although any stem cell therapies for type 1 and type 2 diabetes are many years away from widespread clinical use, researchers agree that stem cells hold great potential to treat and perhaps even cure a range of different health conditions.  'Stem cell research is an exciting area of science that, in the long term, could help us bring about a future without diabetes.'  ________________________________________________  Meanwhile, children and teenagers with recently diagnosed type 1 diabetes are being given daily vitamin D pills in a new clinical trial.  There is evidence vitamin D may help treat autoimmmune conditions by dampening inflammation.	1
The Dan Simmons novel Hyperion, along with its companion/second-half novel The Fall of Hyperion, is one of the great modern works of science fiction. With a story of seven characters on a pilgrimage to enter a time-warped tomb, the story adopts the structure of the Canterbury Tales to weave together disparate genres, the influence of poetry by John Keats, and far-flung science fiction concepts. Bradley Cooper has wanted to adapt Hyperion for many years; some time ago he even lobbied to get the gig writing the script. Now he, along with Graham King and Todd Phillips, is producing a Hyperion TV series for Syfy. THR reports that Syfy is working with the three producers to adapt the novel(s) into event series form, with Itamar Moses (Boardwalk Empire) writing and acting as co-exec producer. Bradley Cooper said in a statement, It is an absolute honor to enter into the world created by Dan Simmons that is arguably one of the greatest works of science fiction, and help realize it for television audiences. Syfy has been more ambitious of late in developing TV series that engage on a deep level with science fiction, rather than just adopting the superficial trappings of sci-fi. Hyperion could benefit from that treatment; the story is so epic in scope that adapting it into one or two movies always seemed like a woefully insufficient approach. The TV series format may allow enough breathing room so that each of the pilgrims' stories can be told in detail while also building the story's universe and allowing for a visual realization of the incredible end-game.	1
The federal government and most states are throwing away $28 billion in yearly tax revenue by not legalizing marijuana, according to a new analysis from the Tax Foundation, an independent think tank. The bulk of that revenue -- $20.5 billion of it -- would accrue to states through the collection of excise taxes on marijuana sales, general sales taxes, and income and payroll taxes levied on workers and businesses in a mature legal marijuana industry. The federal government would take in another $7.5 billion, primarily from income and payroll taxes, and $500 million in excise taxes if marijuana were to be taxed the same way tobacco is. These are estimates relying on a certain number of assumptions about the size of the marijuana market ($45 billion in sales annually) and the ways that governments decide to tax the sale of the drug. For instance, if the federal government decided to slap a 10 percent surtax on marijuana sales rather than a tobacco-style per-pound tax, that $500 million excise tax figure would grow to $5.3 billion. As German Lopez points out over at Vox, these figures account for just a tiny slice of annual government spending in the United States, so don't expect to balance your state budget on the backs of marijuana smokers any time soon. [Something interesting happens to weed after it's legal] Still, $28 billion is nothing to scoff at. The Tax Foundation analysis points out that marijuana tax revenues in Colorado and Washington are exceeding projections by a considerable margins. Colorado initially projected it would receive $70 million in annual taxes on marijuana sales and excise taxes, but it is on track to pull in $140 million this year. The money goes to fund things like school construction and drug abuse-prevention campaigns. Critics point out that marijuana legalization carries some social costs too as people may become more likely to abuse the drug and suffer the negative consequences of abuse and addiction, if the drug is more widely available. But as the Tax Foundation analysis points out, people are already using and abusing marijuana -- regardless of legality. According to the National Survey on Drug Use and Health, over 13 percent of Americans age 12 and older, 0r 35 million people, used marijuana in 2014. And 4.2 million of them met criteria for substance abuse or dependence. We're already paying the social cost of marijuana abuse, in other words. Increased tax revenues could help offset those costs. And marijuana prohibition carries a whole host of costs of its own -- roughly a half-billion dollars a year to arrest people for simple marijuana possession. Billions more to arrest and prosecute people who sell and traffic the drug. And the difficult-to-quantify cost of restricting the ability of millions of people who would prefer to use a drug that, by any reasonable metric, is considerably less harmful than alcohol.

Police in Thessaloniki have arrested a PAOK fan accused of dumping a crate of fish on the visiting Olympiakos bench. A 34-year-old man covered the bench in several kilograms of anchovies in a stunt that delayed a tense Greek Cup semi-final for more than an hour. Olympiakos's home ground is in the port of Piraeus, and the club's supporters are nicknamed 'anchovies'. PAOK won 1-0 on Wednesday but the game was repeatedly halted by brawls on the pitch and three players were sent off.	1

Trump, to his credit, has indeed delivered a message about Russia's actions with regards to Ukraine and others, saying earlier this month that it must "cease its destabilizing activities in Ukraine and elsewhere" and end its support for "hostile" governments in Syria and Iran. Pence also pointed out that Trump has said he will sign Congress's new Russia sanctions bill, but it's not really even a choice for Trump: Congress has way more than enough votes to override his veto.	1
As many of you know Jeff and I have spent the past year working on a new book, Healthy Bread in Five Minutes a Day: 100 New Recipes Featuring Whole Grains, Fruits, Vegetables, and Gluten-Free Ingredients (HBin5). It is a project that started with you! Because of your questions, comments and requests for breads made with whole grains, seeds, nuts, fruits, veggies and even gluten-free ingredients, we set to work to create new recipes. We liked them so well, we decided to do another book. We've been playing with ways to make breads that are not only nutritious, but incredibly tasty and still fit into our busy lives. The methods will still be fast, easy and only take 5 minutes, but the results are wonderful breads made with ingredients that will keep us happy and healthy, no matter our dietary needs. Who better than a pastry chef and a doctor to write such a book? Writing a cookbook takes a long time, not only to test and retest and then test again the recipes, but the editing and designing of the book after we write it. Although it is nearly done we still have more work to do before it comes out this fall. HBin5 will be available in the book stores on October 27th of this year. In the mean time Amazon has posted it for pre-orders for those of you who want to avoid the mad rush at the book stores! 😉 In honor of HBin5 we've launched this new home page on our website. My husband Graham designed and built the site for us and Jeff's wife Laura, who is also our copy editor, wrote much of it. We are so fortunate to have such a creative and talented team to help us. We want to thank them for all of their work!And THANK YOU for inspiring us to write our second book. As a thank you we are giving away 5 signed copies of our CURRENT book: Artisan Bread in Five Minutes a Day.  Here is a little glimpse into our life of writing HBin5: (more…)	1
The Coalition has reaffirmed it could call a double-dissolution election if it wins government but is blocked from repealing the carbon tax. Opposition MPs on Saturday repeated their view that September's election would be a referendum on the carbon tax, and that a joint sitting would be a fallback option if they're prevented from scrapping the policy. Opposition frontbencher Christopher Pyne confirmed that leaked details of the Coalition's environment policy, including the timeline for rolling back the carbon tax, were correct. The reports included calling a double-dissolution election within five months if the Coalition's efforts to abolish carbon pricing were thwarted. When asked about the reports, opposition climate action spokesman Greg Hunt said if the Coalition won the federal election, voters would expect Labor to respect their mandate. The Coalition however retained the right to go to a joint sitting of Parliament if Labor stood in the way.	1
LaVar Ball and Big Baller Brand hope to release a debut sneaker for Lonzo Ball's rookie season. The price tag will be in the $200 range, according to The Vertical's Nick DePaula. That would price the UCLA standout's signature kicks ahead of All-Stars and MVP candidates like LeBron James, Kevin Durant, Stephen Curry, and James Harden. Lonzo is projected as the No. 2 overall pick in the 2017 NBA draft, but he has no endorsement offers from any of the three major sneaker companies in Nike, Adidas, or Under Armour. It's the first time a top draft prospect has been shut out of the Big 3 of kicks corporations. That's because LaVar Ball has pushed for a co-branded partnership with whichever company intends to sign him, which would allow Big Baller Brand to operate underneath the parent umbrella. That's like Jordan Brand, which signs athletes and has its own sneaker line as part of the Nike family. Ball has also set the bar high, claiming he and his sons will settle for no less than a combined $1 billion deal over the life of the contract. That prompted Nike CEO Phil Knight to call Ball's asking price "a bit steep," and company consultant George Raveling to call Ball himself "the worst thing to happen to basketball in the last hundred years." Lonzo Ball is projected as the No. 2 overall pick in the upcoming draft after an impressive freshman season leading the UCLA Bruins to a Sweet 16 appearance in the NCAA tournament. How does that price tag compare with other NBA stars' footwear? It would rank Lonzo ahead of the league's stars with the priciest basketball kicks out. LeBron James' LeBron XIV retails at $175, with the customizable XIV iD series ringing up $220 before tax. Kevin Durant's latest KD9 comes in at $150, while James Harden's Harden Vol. 1 Series with Adidas run $140. Under Armour debuted Steph Curry's Curry 3's at $149.99, but has since slashed the price to $99.99. And Paul George's debut sneaker, the PG1, hit shelves this year at $109.99. For some players, sneaker price is a status symbol. When Durant's KD9 dropped last June, its $150 tag was $30 cheaper than that of its predecessor, the KD8. But it was still nearly twice as expensive as his debut sneaker, the KD1, that retailed for $88. "As humbly as I can say it, I'm not a $88 player," Durant said, according to Nick DePaula. "I'm an elite player in the league. I wanted everything to be affordable, but I knew we had to sacrifice some stuff." LaVar Ball thinks the world of his son. He's twice claimed Lonzo Ball is better than Curry, a two-time league MVP. And at his $200 price tag, he's doubled down on those sentiments. Now only two questions remain: Can Lonzo's play back up his father's talk? And more importantly, will the kicks be fire?	1
Republicans launched an unprecedented frontal assault against environmental protections and regulations this year, prompting Rep. Henry Waxman (D-Calif.) to call his chamber "the most anti-environment House in history." Here are the 10 most powerful and outspoken opponents of clean air, clean water, conservation and climate action. 10. Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas. Thought to be the biggest lifetime recipient of oil-industry contributions in the Senate, Cornyn has rewarded Exxon-Mobil's largesse by supporting the industry's position on pretty much every energy or environmental issue that has ever appeared before him. That's why he, like everyone on this list, has a "0" on the League of Conservation Voters' scorecard for pro-environment votes. 9. Rep. Don Young, R-Alaska. A tireless advocate for opening Alaska's pristine Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil drilling, Young was involved in one of the more entertaining name-calling spats in Congress this year when he got into a tiff over the refuge with author and professor Doug Brinkley. You can be the judge of who won by watching the video replay. 8. Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Vista. There may have been a time when the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee lived up to its name, investigating and bringing to light incidents of government waste, fraud and abuse. But I can't remember back that far. In recent decades it has served as a tool for the majority party in the House to bash and embarrass the presidential administration, at least during times such as now when the House isn't controlled by the president's party. Issa, the committee's current chairman, has turned such political gamesmanship into an art form, and has been particularly keen to attack environmental regulators and policymakers. In so doing he has turned up precious little waste or fraud, but provided plenty of political theater for those who want to dismantle the Environmental Protection Agency or end subsidies for clean energy. 7. Rep. Bob Latta, R-Ohio. Latta has the distinction of sponsoring the most far-reaching and destructive amendment to the most egregious anti-environment bill passed by the House this year. The TRAIN Act, approved by the House in September but not expected to get through the Senate, is a breathtaking (literally) gift to polluters that creates a committee to study the costs but ignore the benefits of environmental regulation, while also blocking EPA efforts to crack down on deadly emissions from power plants. Latta's contribution is an amendment that undermines a cornerstone of the Clean Air Act, requiring the EPA to take industry costs into account when setting health-based standards. This would allow corporate polluters to overrule scientists and strikes at the heart of the polluter-pays principle that has guided environmental policy for 40 years. 6. Rep. Edward Whitfield, R-Ky. Another architect of the TRAIN wreck, Whitfield offered an amendment that would block the EPA from regulating mercury and other toxics from power plants, and from coming up with a rule on smog and soot that crosses state lines. Together, these two regulations would save an estimated 51,000 lives per year. But what are a few thousand lives when utility profits are at stake? 5. Sen. James M. Inhofe, R-Okla. One of the most outspoken climate-change deniers in the Senate (he's renowned for calling global warming "the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on the American people"), Inhofe is also one of the most influential Republicans in the country when it comes to environmental policy. As ranking member of the Committee on Environment and Public Works, he uses his position to push for expanded oil drilling and reduce environmental regulation. Inhofe sometimes even finds himself to the right of the polluter-packed U.S. Chamber of Commerce; this summer he placed a hold on President Obama's nominee John Bryson as Commerce secretary, even though Bryson had the blessing of the Chamber, because Inhofe felt Bryson was too pro-environment. 4. Rep. Michael Simpson, R-Idaho. Simpson has stepped to the front lines of his party's war on Mother Nature by adding dozens of anti-environment riders to must-pass budget legislation. Among other things, Simpson aims to let mountaintop coal-mining operations continue to pollute streams, prevent the EPA from regulating coal-ash disposal, and exempt pesticide sprayers from complying with the Clean Water Act. 3. Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. The enforcer of Republican Party discipline, Senate Minority Leader McConnell is among the key architects of his party's stance on environmental issues. In 2009, when Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina was among the few Republicans willing to discuss a bipartisan climate bill with Democrats, it was McConnell who reportedly convinced him to back away. This spring he led a failed effort to block the EPA's authority to regulate greenhouse-gas emissions and overrule its finding that climate change threatens public health -- tantamount	1
Donovan Bailey facing third driving-related charge Donovan Bailey, once the fastest man on the planet and an idol to millions of track fans in Canada and around the world, has been charged with having a blood-alcohol level of more than 80 milligrams while driving a car in Toronto. Former world and Olympic sprint champion Donovan Bailey speaking at a press conference in 2004. Bailey has been charged with driving with an alcohol level of more than 80 milligrams. It is the third time Bailey has been before the courts on driving charges. (Feb. 5, 2004) ( Hans Deryk / Toronto Star File Photo ) Donovan Bailey's iconic pose after winning the 100-metre sprint in world record time at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics. ( Toronto Star File Photo ) Bailey, 44, was not at College Park Court on Monday for a first appearance on a charge, commonly referred to as "being over .08." Bailey, who gave his address to the Toronto police who stopped him as St. James, Jamaica, was reportedly in his native country Monday promoting the upcoming London Olympics where he is to be a TV commentator for the Canadian media consortium covering the games. The matter was put over to June 11 for a pre-trial conference. Article Continued Below According to the information filed in court, Bailey was stopped by police on March 28 in Toronto and administered the breathalyzer test. The police record does not say where or what time of day Bailey was stopped by police in the downtown 51 Division. This is the third time the Canadian icon — a five-time world and Olympic champion and inductee into Canada's Sports Hall of Fame — has been before the courts on driving related charges. Bailey captured the hearts of Canadians at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics where he won the gold medal and set a new world record of 9.84 in the 100-metre sprint. Two years later his image was somewhat tarnished. In May 1998, Bailey was fined $200 for failing to report an accident after he left the scene of a single-car cash that totalled his $80,000 Mercedes. The car, awarded to him for a gold medal performance at the 1995 track and field championships in Sweden, struck a concrete utility pole, flipped over and caught fire. Bailey emerged from the wreck without injury. Passersby offered to get him medical attention but Bailey refused and asked to be driven home instead. Police arrived at his home five hours later. Article Continued Below At the time, Crown Attorney Paul Renwick told the court that a more serious charge of careless driving was withdrawn because there was "no reasonable prospect of a conviction." Bailey was assessed three demerit points over the accident. Three years later, in December 2001, Bailey was convicted of driving a Mercedes-Benz 200 kilometres an hour on the Queen Elizabeth Way and fined $975. An Ontario Provincial Police officer testified he tracked Bailey's black Mercedes doing 200 km/h in the slow lane of the westbound QEW between Mississauga Rd. and Erin Mills Parkway at 3:34 in the morning. Bailey lived in Oakville at the time, but apparently has since sold his mansion there. "He runs fast and he drives fast, except now he's going to slow down," his lawyer Paul Stunt said as he left court. Bailey was at a track meet in Italy at the time and did not appear in court. Under the Highway Traffic Act Bailey lost six demerit points but his licence was not suspended. After his racing career ended Bailey started his own company called DBX Sport Management, which helps amateur athletes find ways to promote themselves, and a sports injury clinic in Oakville, Ont. If convicted of the current charge Bailey faces a fine and licence suspension.	1

I've known David and his family for years, which is why it's shocking that Northeast High School and the Montgomery County Sheriff's Department are overreacting after they found his dad's knife in the truck this young man borrowed to bring to school. Northeast High School in Clarksville, TN had a random search on Thursday, February 20th and they checked lockers, backpacks and cars. David drove his dad's car to school that day, so it too was searched with his permission. It turns out that his Dad had left his fishing knife in the car, apparently wedged between the seat & console so the police cited David for a weapon on school property. Not only that, but the school gave him a 10 day suspension and reprimanded him to 90 days at the alternative school! David explained that it was his dad's car & his fishing knife but to no avail. He is a A/B honor student who has never ever had any problems in or out of school. He may appeal the punishment, but this is his senior year and who knows if he will be able to go back to school or finish out his senior year. He did not have a knife in school, in his backpack, or his locker. He drove his dad's car to school and his dad left his fishing knife in the locked car. Just think what this could do to this promising young man's future. He may be forced to miss his prom and his final months with his classmates before college, and more importantly, he may not even be able to graduate. David also may have his record tarnished with a weapons charge. Please sign and share. If enough of us speak out, the school board and local authorities will have no choice but to drop all punishment against David who did nothing wrong! 2/27 update. David's school penalty has been reduced so he will reportedly be able to go to prom and graduate, but he's still facing 30 days at an alternative school and a charge for possession of a prohibited weapon, so please keep signing and sharing.	1
Teen working for California-based pizza chain says she was fired after asking for equal wage FOX Kansas City FOX Kansas City Image 1 of / 1 Caption Close Teen working for California-based pizza chain says she was fired after asking for equal wage 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Jensen Walcott easily got a summer job at a Kansas City, Kansas slice house franchise called Pizza Studio. After being hired on the spot, the 17-year-old was told she'd be making $8 an hour — slightly higher than the state's $7.25 minimum. She was also thrilled to find out she'd be working alongside a friend of hers named Jake Reed. That excitement didn't last long; she soon discovered that Reed, who was also 17, had comparable work experience, and was working the same position, was hired at $8.25 an hour. Walcott told Fox Kansas City that when she called her manager to ask about the pay difference, she was initially put on hold. "I was like maybe when I'm on hold right now, she will just offer me $8.25 and everything is gonna be good but... she didn't do that," Walcott said. When she was taken off hold, her manager fired her, saying she could do so because "discussing wages is against its policy." A similar fate met Reed. "She said you're fired. Basically just like a 10 second phone call," he told Fox. As attorney David White confirms, the National Labor Relations Board maintains that employees may discuss pay with each other, meaning that Walcott was in the right. He thinks that Walcott and Reed may have a case against the Calabasas, California-based pizza chain, though the two haven't decided yet if they will take legal action. As the American Association of University Women found, for the year 2014, women in Kansas earned just $0.79 for each dollar men in Kansas did. That rate is slightly higher in California. Meanwhile, Pizza Studio recently opened its second Bay Area franchise location inside Concord's Sunvalley Mall. UPDATE: Pizza Studio has responded to SFGATE's request for comment, saying that after fully investigating the incident, that "gender did not play a role in determination of either salary, nor for any Pizza Studio employee." Ashleigh Siefker, the organization's Executive Director of Operations, says that she has "personally instituted policies and procedures that strictly prohibit discrimination of any kind." Siefker adds: "After an in-depth review, we are confident this instance was not one of gender-bias but rather a failure to assign the correct salary and a misunderstanding of our company policies by one of our employees; it should be noted the manager in communication with Miss Walcott is also a female. "Pizza Studio did not agree however with how the manager handled the situation. We pride ourselves with treating our employees and guests with respect and open communication at all times. We have extended a formal apology to both Miss Walcott and Mr. Reed and have parted ways with the responsible manager in the best interest of all parties involved. We plan to use this experience to better improve our hiring procedures and policies moving forward."  Alyssa Pereira is a staff writer for SFGATE. Follow her here on Twitter.	1
The simplest sports betting math many punters possess is the ability to convert odds and calculate break even percentages, also known as implied probabilities. After spending years doing these calculations, first on a windows calculator, and later in an excel spread sheet, I finally developed the Intense Gambling odds converter you'll find below. Odds Converter Tool [oddscalc] In case you're not familiar with the difference between American Odds called moneylines and European odds, which are in decimal format, here is how each works. American Odds Also known as moneylines, are offered as either a positive or negative number. When positive, the moneyline represents how much profit a punter stands to make on a $100 stake. To give an example, a line of +125 represents risk $100 to win $125 profit. Negative moneylines represent how much a punter needs to stake for a winning bet to profit $100. A moneyline of -235 is risk $235 to win $100 profit. European Odds Also known as decimal odds, represent how much a winning ticket is worth for each dollar staked. For example if a punter wagers $10.00 at odds 1.95 and wins, their payout is $10 x 1.95 = $19.50. A major difference between American and European odds is that while the American version is based on profit, the European version is based on return. Likewise, a $10 wager on odds 1.95 translates to risk $10.00 to potentially profit $9.50. Considering 1.95 pays less than even money, it would be expressed in American odds format as a negative moneyline. The best way to convert American odds to European format, and vice versa, is to use the "odds converter" located above. For those of you interested in the math, I'll cover it great detail later in this article. First let me discuss break even percentage and implied probability. Implied Probability Is how often a bet must win for it to have neutral value. To give the simplest example, take American odds +100 (which is the equivalent of 2.00 in European odds) where winning bets are paid even money, here the implied probability is 50%. This is because in American format risk $100 to win $100, and in European format stake $1 to return $2, you'll need to win an average of 50% of the time to break even over the long haul. Where our odds converter comes in handy is let's say you've done an analysis on a game between the Boston Red Sox and Tampa Bay Rays and determined the Red Sox should be 57% favorites in this game. After price shopping, the best odds you can find on the Red Sox are -128, which in European format is 1.781. There are now two ways you can determine if you've found a good bet. The first method is to plug 57% into our odds converter under the required break even field. Doing this you'll find at 57% the true odds in American format are -132.6 (1.754 European). Consider you're getting better than this with the -128 (1.781 European) you have a profitable bet. The second way you could approach the above problem, is to plug -128 into our odds converted under American odds. Here you'll see the required break even rate (implied probability) is 56.14%. Considering your calculation of a 57% win probability comes out higher than the win rate needed to break even, you've find yourself a good bet. Sports Betting Strategy You Should, but Most Don't, Understand For those with basic sports betting math skills, the sample problem I'm about to give will be easy to solve. If you're stumped, or answer incorrectly, what you're about to read could very well be what gets you on the path required to winning consistently at sports betting. The sample Every online betting site with odds on a NBA basketball game between the Orlando Magic and Sacramento Kings has the odds listed in American format as Magic -545 / Kings +445. Someone comes long and says "I'll offer you either Magic -490 or Kings +490, your choice". Which of these options, if any, has the highest expected value? The way many sports bettors would approach this is to average out 545 and 445 and figure the fair value is about -495 / +495. Using this failed logic they'd end up taking the Magic -490 as that's better than the fair price and must be +EV. The problem is neither American nor European odds work this way; they can't be averaged out to calculate the fair value. The first step those who understand sports betting math take to solve this problem is the conversion of Magic -545 / Kings +445 to break even percentages. After plugging the odds	1
Question. Hi Mike: Is there a way to use fireplace ash that would be beneficial to my garden or lawn? If not, what is the best way to dispose of the stuff? ---Chris in Berwyn, PA (formerly Newport, RI) Mike: Like many of my neighbors here in Eastern Carolina, I have a 'burn pile' where I dispose of storm debris, old trimmed branches (mainly pine and oak) and all manner of other garden/yard items. My question is: Is the leftover ash good for anything? I know better than to put it in the compost pile. Thanks, ---Doug in Beaufort, NC Answer. Thank you, Doug. As you note, I've long cautioned gardeners not to include anything other than very small quantities of wood ash in a compost pile—a little of this highly alkaline material goes a long way. But those of us with naturally acidic soils can (and should) use much larger amounts on our lawns and gardens—as a substitute for lime. Before we get to that, however, I'd like to take a moment to try and pry your incendiary little fingers away from those piles. Yes, we guys love to set stuff on fire—especially in the name of 'yard work'. But such burning fouls the air, adds greenhouse gases we don't need, and wastes lots of nutrients. Pile up your "garden/yard" items and they'll turn into nice compost, especially with lots of leaves in the mix. Stack the branches on the outskirts of your property to provide habitat for toads, birds and other beneficials. (And you'll find a surprising amount of compost at the bottom of those piles after a few years.) If you can't go completely 'burn turkey', consider cutting back to one small bonfire a year to satisfy your inner firebug, and get better use out of the rest of that wood. And good quality hardwood ashes—that means no ashes from BBQ grills, cardboard, plywood, painted, or pressure treated wood—do have real agricultural use. (Softwoods have a lot less value, but you shouldn't be burning soft wood in a stove or fireplace anyway.) The best information on how to properly utilize the valuable material in wood ash is contained in a couple of great farm-scale articles from the Georgia Extension Service and the government of Alberta's department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development. We'll post links to those articles at this end of this Q of the Week for those of you who want all the details. To help put the advice into garden-size perspective, we turned to Julia Gaskin, a Land Application Specialist for the University of Georgia Extension Service who recently updated their wood ash information article. She explains that ash from good quality hardwoods contains a very nice amount of potassium; at least 3% by weight. Also known as potash, this is the "K" in the fabled N-P-K scale of plant nutrients—the Dow Jones of Horticulture! Potash improves root health and strengthens the very cellular structure of plants, helping them resist all kinds of stresses. Wood Ash also contains lots of micronutrients, and, on average, 15% calcium—a nutrient often lacking in many of our soils and fertilizers. Ashes even improve the structure and tilth of soils. But they must be used with care, as all that calcium makes them highly alkaline—a range of 9 to 13—and they WILL change your soil's pH. But that's OK, because that's exactly what you going to be using them to do. So the first thing you need is a soiltest. I know—I always say that. And I'm always right! This time double, because you'll be using those ashes to actively change the pH of your soil and you need to know where you're starting from. All soil tests report pH—the measure of your soil's acidity or alkalinity. The center of this scale is the number 7, the scientific neutral. I say 'scientific', because most plants prefer soil to be a little acidic, around 6.5, for good growth. Some of our most popular plants, however, require a highly acidic soil (in the 4 to 5.5 range) to survive: azaleas, rhododendrons, blueberries, mums, marigolds, mountainlaurel, oak,pecan and sweet potato to name a few. Keep your alkaline ashes far away from these and other acid lovers. But many parts of the country—especially areas with heavy rainfall—have soils that are naturally down in that highly acidic range, which your regular plants do not enjoy one bit. Normally people use lime to correct this, which is why soil test results often include a "liming recommendation", specifying how many pounds of lime per thousand square feet to add to your lawn or garden to bring the pH up to around	1
BY: Follow @HashtagGriswold  Hollywood director Oliver Stone, who recently emerged as a prominent celebrity defender of Russian President Vladimir Putin, has a son who works for a Russian government-funded propaganda outlet. Stone is the director of the upcoming Showtime series "The Putin Interviews," compromised of a series of interviews Stone conducted with Putin over a span of two years. The show has already been criticized for taking Putin's assertions at face value and excusing Russian aggression. Most recently Stone was panned for defending Putin during an interview with CBS' "The Late Show With Stephen Colbert." "That doesn't seem like an interview," Colbert told him. "That seems like an opportunity for him to merely propagandize." Stone responded that Putin has been "insulted and abused" and "never really said anything bad about anybody." Despite Stone's claim that he treated Putin fairly, his son Sean Stone is a host on the Russian-backed television network RT America, part of RT News, which observers have called the Kremlin's propaganda outlet. Sean Stone was hired in 2015 to replace an RT journalist who resigned in protest after bucking the network line and criticizing the Russian invasion of Crimea. Like his father—who has defended Adolf Hitler and Fidel Castro, among others—Stone has a history of defending anti-American authoritarian leaders. The younger Stone made headlines in 2012 for defending then-Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad as "really misunderstood." Stone, who converted to Shia Islam during a trip to Iran, told Bill O'Reilly he was "OK with Iran having a nuclear weapon" and insisted the country is a moderate republic.	1

A couple in New York wandered into a reporter's live shot from Wednesday night's Rockefeller Center Christmas tree lighting then thought it would be funny to re-enact the final moments of Eric Garner's life. The outrageous prank is made all the more shocking by the fact that WPIX reporter Allison Kaden was on the scene to report on the protest at the ceremony. As she described the night's peaceful demonstration, a man in a suit and a woman noticed they were on camera. Scroll down for video Shocking: Allison Kaden of WPIX in New York was covering the protests of the Rockefeller Center Christmas tree lighting ceremony when the couple pictured behind her used the opportunity to mock Eric Garner, it appears Threw her hands up: The man in the suit first noticed the camera, but the woman threw her hands in the air, as Eric garner did just before his death, after it dawned on her what her companion was doing The man grabbed the woman around the neck and then, as it dawned on the woman what her friend was doing, she played along and put her hands up. They both then laughed and walked off camera. Kaden finished her segment non-the-wiser. The in-studio anchors didn't seem to notice, either. However, the folks at Deadspin picked up on the sick joke and the angry comments were sure to follow. With good reason. Garner died following his altercation with police due, at least in part, to the chokehold put on him by Officer Daniel Pantaleo. The couple laugh as they scuttle out of the shot and WPIX reporter Allison Kaden finishes her segment non-the-wiser The tree lighting ceremony came just hours after a grand jury decided not to indict a Pantaleo in Garner's videotaped chokehold death. Mayor Bill de Blasio canceled his scheduled appearance to meet with elected officials and activists on Staten Island as citywide protests started to gather steam. Police presence was heavy as hundreds of protesters stood behind rows of police barricades jamming the sidewalks on Fifth Avenue within sight of the holiday revelers.

OKLAHOMA CITY -- All-Star point guard Russell Westbrook will have surgery to repair cartilage in his right knee and will be out indefinitely, dealing a harsh blow to the Oklahoma City Thunder's championship chances. General manager Sam Presti said Friday the Thunder had not yet scheduled Westbrook's surgery and would not have an accurate timeline for his return until after the procedure was done. No one would rule out Westbrook's possible return if Oklahoma City keeps advancing in the playoffs, and All-Star teammate Kevin Durant only said his teammates "hope" Westbrook can play again this postseason. "We're not trying to rush him or bring him back ahead of schedule. We want to make sure he's healthy and his knee is right," Durant said. "That's our only concern with it right now. ... We have to come together as a team and worry about the basketball. All he has to worry about is him getting healthy." The three-time All-Star was hurt in Game 2 of the Thunder's playoff series against Houston on Wednesday night. Rookie Patrick Beverley lunged for a steal in the second quarter and his hip collided with Westbrook's knee. Beverley called Westbrook's injury "unfortunate" and said Oklahoma City is still dangerous without him. "Anyone who knows me knows I don't go out there and try to hurt anybody," Beverley said. "I play at one speed and that's fast. I was just trying to make a play on the ball before they called a timeout and it's just unfortunate." "That's a freakish accident, that play," Grizzlies forward Tayshaun Prince said. "I'm pretty sure the Oklahoma City fans will be pretty pissed off at Beverly." Coach Scott Brooks claimed after Westbrook missed practice Thursday that Westbrook would be "fine tomorrow," but the team found out differently Friday morning.	1
The Republican National Committee (RNC) said that Hillary Clinton's meeting Saturday with the Federal Bureau of Investigation makes her the first major party presidential candidate to sit for an interview with an FBI criminal investigation about her own conduct. RNC chairman Reince Priebus remarked upon the historical significance of such an interview. Breitbart News has extensively reported on the potential Espionage Act violations committed by Clinton and her top aides Huma Abedin and Cheryl Mills. Here is Priebus' statement: Hillary Clinton has just taken the unprecedented step of becoming the first major party presidential candidate to be interviewed by the FBI as part of a criminal investigation surrounding her reckless conduct. That the FBI wanted her for questioning reinforces her central role in deliberately creating a culture which put her own political ambitions above State Department rules and jeopardized our national security. In over 2,000 emails, Clinton's decision exposed classified information, including 22 that included top secret intelligence, just so she could skirt transparency laws in order to hide her shady dealings as Secretary of State. When you factor in Clinton directed this server be established to cover up the tangled web of donors, State Department actions and her family foundation, we must ask ourselves if this is the kind of leadership we want in the White House. "The American people need to have confidence that the Obama Justice Department is conducting a fair and impartial investigation, but when the attorney general meets secretly with Bill Clinton just days before Hillary's interrogation is conducted discreetly over a holiday weekend, it raises serious concerns about special treatment. Others have lost their security clearances, their jobs, or even gone to jail for doing far less, and Clinton needs to be held to the same standard as everyone else," Priebus stated. An inspector general report found that Clinton violated State Department rules with her private server. The RNC is promoting five instances of Clinton violating State Department policy.	1
One of my favorite games in the last 20 years is XCOM 2. I love Wasteland 2 and Pillars of Eternity also. But that video imo, is not very good.  That's not what I saw in that video. If you watch the video again, you're going to see the complete extend of how much those NPC's are "living" in that world. They're just as limited as anything going on in SOTA.  I don't think SOTA does differ much there. But neither does that Bard's Tale video. Neither does Morrowind for that matter.  NPC's are dead mindless hucks compared to human beings. If you're talking about MMO's then you're talking about multiplayer (which is in the acronym). If you're talking about single player RPG's then you're talking about NPC's and that really requires you to bring your own immerssion, some players mileage may vary. For me I'm not at all immsersed in that video. In fact I find myself being the opposite.  To be fair, I'm not at all immersed by SOTA NPC's either, and I've posted about that over the years A LOT. There are points in the story line where I can get into the lore here, but it's rare I think mainly because nothing ever seems to work correctly. When you play a game that has a lot of bugs like ours does (because it's in development) it's hard to stay immerssed in a quest line that doesn't work. When quests have gone on for a long period of time without a hitch, I've enjoyed them here.  And just to put this back into context some. I finished X-Com 2 because it worked. I didn't finish Wasteland 2 or Pillars of Eternity (even though I played both a ton) because at some point I just got lost and didn't know what to do next, I honestly think they were both bugged. So there you go...single player RPG has to be really well made and bug free to "work". Multiplayer not the same...you can play for hours and hours in a bugged world and players make that content....well, playable. Click to expand...	1
RELATED VIDEO CINNAMINSON — A Burlington County man was put in jail after he didn't return money mistakenly given to him by a teller while cashing a check at a bank, according to a report on PhillyBurbs.com Felipe S. DePadula, 27, of Riverside is charged with receiving stolen property after a teller at Delanco Federal Savings Bank on Route 130 in Cinnaminson gave him $3,000 when he went to cash a $300 check. The bank contacted DePadula about the error a few days later but he said he lost the envelope that had the cash, the report said. He was charged Wednesday after police examined the bank's security footage. DePadula was held on $2,500 bail. The construction worker has been unemployed since being injured, according to 6abc.com.	1
Montgomery County is in the peak season for young bears to strike out on their own, which has led to sightings of black bears on the streets, at a church, and area parks. Ken D'Loughy of the Maryland Department of National Resources told Montgomery Community Media that residents reported a black bear on Rainbow Arch Drive in Clarksburg Tuesday. The DNR also received reports of a bear sighting at Greenridge Baptist Church. D'Loughy says he believes this is the same black bear spotted earlier in Damascus and Germantown. On Monday, a black bear was spotted running alongside a fence at Ridge Road Recreational Park. SEE ALSO: Another Bear Sighting Makes Waves Throughout Montgomery Just last week, a black bear was spotted on Observation Drive in Germantown. In Damascus, Montgomery County Police say residents have reported numerous sightings of a black bear at and around Oak Ridge Park last month. The now-famous Poolesville Bear sighting on Old Oaks Estate in Beallsville led to Internet fame in the form of a popular Facebook parody account. Black bear sightings are most common in Montgomery County in June and July when young, solitary bears – frequently young males -- travel considerable distances in search of a suitable home range to call their own, says Montgomery Parks. Most of the young bears settle in western Maryland, Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Virginia. Tips to avoid bears: NEVER FEED BEARS OR OTHER WILDLIFE (intentionally or unintentionally). Feeding black bears can seem fascinating and fun, but is a recipe for disaster. Feeding bears is illegal in the State of Maryland. (intentionally or unintentionally). Feeding black bears can seem fascinating and fun, but is a recipe for disaster. Feeding bears is illegal in the State of Maryland. Don't leave bowls of pet food or water outside. If possible, keep all pet food indoors at all times. Keep garbage in sturdy, clean containers with tight fitting lids. (Bear proof cans are recommended in areas where bear interactions become common.) Secure all trash cans and clean them regularly to minimize strong food odors as much as possible. Keep compost that contains food materials in enclosed bins away from your residence Keep bird feeders out of reach. Do not over fill bird feeders, and stop filling them prior to the month of April (It has been said that "In April, a bird feeder becomes a bear feeder") Keep barbeque grills clean and secure Always walk your dogs on a leash Do not tolerate bears becoming comfortable around your yard – encourage them to leave by making loud noises etc. »Photos of black bear at Ridge Road Recreational Park, courtesy of Montgomery County Parks	1
MEP Nessa Childers, who represents Ireland East in Europe, has this morning resigned from the Parliamentary Labour Party (PLP) to join fellow Labour members in opposition. MEP Nessa Childers, who represents Ireland East in Europe, has this morning resigned from the Parliamentary Labour Party (PLP) to join fellow Labour members in opposition. In a statement, Ms Childers said she entered politics to help people, and was resigning from the PLP because she no longer wanted to support a government that is hurting people. "It is predicted that Ireland will have to experience tight budgets for the foreseeable future, long after we exit the bail-out programme," said the MEP. "My question is will this Government continue with business as usual and ignore the lack of fairness across government policy? "My dissatisfaction with the party in government has been known for some time; however recent statements from the Labour ministers have dismayed me. They continue to insist that because of the dire economic situation there is no alternative to current government policies. Ms Childers has now become the latest in a line of Labour members who are now outside of the parliamentary party. TDs Patrick Nulty, Colm Keaveney, Róisin Shortall and Tommy Broughan have all distanced themselves from the senior leaders. "The government is implementing harmful conservative policies," said Ms Childers. "Senior Labour people appear to refuse to discuss or acknowledge recent research that shows that the greatest impact of financial distress has been seen in the lower income households in Ireland, and that the austerity agenda is not improving the real economy lived and experienced by ordinary people. "I think there is a possibility that we could see a group of people coming together to take up the ideas and values of Labour – leaving the party and its members hostage to a leadership that appears to be more comfortable with policies that protect the more privileged in Irish society. "The party leadership's strategy of attacking people who are loyal to the party's stated policies; coupled with their objection to a special party conference and objection to renegotiating the Programme for Government signals that they is completely cut off from the concerns of the party members and Labour party ideals and values. Labour's popularity has decreased significantly since entering government with Fine Gael in 2011, falling to just 9 per cent in a recent opinion poll.	1

× Man used handgun as hammer at Missouri school BENTON, Mo. (AP) _ A man has been charged with unlawful use of a weapon and child endangerment after police say he used a handgun as a hammer while working on a project at a southeast Missouri elementary school. A probable cause statement from the Scott County Sheriff's Department said 45-year-old Jeffrey Grubbs was volunteering at a 4-H event Monday at Kelly Elementary School in Benton when he gripped the handgun's barrel and used the butt of the weapon to drive a thumbtack into a wood plaque. The Southeast Missourian reports Grubbs was arrested and released Tuesday. Police say Grubbs has a concealed-carry permit, but it's illegal to bring a gun onto school property without consent from a school official. Attempts by The Associated Press to reach an attorney listed as representing Grubbs were unsuccessful. ___ Information from: Southeast Missourian	1
In 1963, Lynda Gunn was asked by her grandfather, a private-school athletic director in Stockbridge, Massachusetts, to model for a buddy of his who was a painter. Gunn, who was eight years old at the time, spent a few sessions wearing a fancy white dress and standing stock still in a walking position—her feet were balanced on wooden blocks to simulate the appearance of being in motion—being sketched and photographed by Norman Rockwell. Rockwell used her image in his celebrated work "The Problem We All Live With": the painting depicts Ruby Bridges, who in 1960 became the first African-American girl to enroll in an all-white Southern elementary school. In it, Gunn-as-Bridges approaches her first day of school flanked by federal marshals, the wall behind her defaced by a graffito slur. Last summer, President Obama requested that the painting, which is in the collection of the Norman Rockwell Museum, in Stockbridge, be loaned to the White House, where it was displayed on a wall outside the Oval Office. Gunn, a taciturn, thoughtful woman who works as a night auditor at the Super 8 Motel in Lee, Massachusetts, was invited to New York recently, to view a series of paintings by Philip Maysles, which are hanging on the wall of the Red Rooster, a restaurant in Harlem owned by Marcus Samuelsson. In one, Maysles—who is the son of Albert Maysles, the documentarian—has drawn "The Problem We All Live With" as it appeared while on exhibition at the Museum of Fine Arts in Houston, complete with a book for comments, in 2006. (A reproduction of the Houston comments book—"The more things change the more they stay the same"; "Security keeps following us"—is provided at the Red Rooster. Guests are invited to contribute their own comments, in a different color ink.) In another, he has drawn Gunn, schoolbooks in hand, being carefully positioned by her father, David Gunn, Jr., in Rockwell's book-lined studio. Another painting, a rendering of Rockwell's famous self-portrait in which Rockwell's face on the canvas has been replaced by Gunn's profile, is, Maysles said, his own oblique self-portrait. Over lunch with Gunn and Jane Allen Petrick, a writer who is working on a book about the real people of color whom Rockwell used as models, and who had initiated the encounter, Maysles explained, "A lot of my work is exploring white identity, and how whiteness is constructed in relation to images people have of black folk." Gunn told Maysles that, like Ruby Bridges, she had been the only black child in her elementary school, though for different sociological reasons. Her family had been in Stockbridge for generations, and her grandfather was a well-known figure in the community. "It was a very sheltered experience—I just got to be a child," she said. Although members of her family were active in the N.A.A.C.P., she did not feel affected by the nation's larger racial tensions until she was older. The only time she felt singled out for being different was when her classmates read "Little Black Sambo." "Everyone would turn around and look at me," she said. "But it wasn't traumatic. It was just a moment." As an adult, she found that her Yankee accent provided a measure of cultural camouflage. "I've gotten a lot of job interviews—on the phone, it's one thing, but when I show up, the jaws drop," she said. At the Red Rooster, Gunn was fêted. The kitchen sent out complimentary pumpkin soup and macaroni-and-cheese; a hefty cookbook was pressed upon her; Samuelsson stopped by to grasp her hand. Gunn said she was honored to have participated in the making of an icon, though she admitted she would have preferred royalties over the ten dollars per session that she was paid by Rockwell. It might also have been nice, she added, to have been invited to the White House to view the painting, as was Ruby Bridges, who is the founder of the Ruby Bridges Foundation. "But I wasn't expecting anything, so I'm not disappointed," Gunn said. She has largely stopped participating in events around "The Problem We All Live With." She said, "It got to be too much—'Will you come and sign autographs,' for nothing, so I stopped." "Do you feel resentment toward me?" Maysles asked. "I'm not resentful," Gunn said, quietly. "I'm happy to see you went somewhere with it." When Maysles asked her to sign a postcard-size reproduction of "Self-Portrait of Norman Rockwell as Ruby Bridges," Gunn signed her name boldly across the blue shirtsleeve of the artist's painting arm. ♦	1

The EFF's barricading of the busy R59 main road next to Pielsfarm, Midvaal this morning – after being prevented from illegally invading land, is another politicking stunt to create chaos and destabilize the Midvaal Local Municipality. The Midvaal Local Municipality condemns any and all types of disruptive protests which have become a hallmark of the EFF's mode of operation during the election campaign period. The Midvaal Local Municipality was informed that the EFF were about to illegally occupy 100 stands on privately owned land in Midvaal and as a result, we sent the Red Ants to prevent the illegal land invasion. However, as a result, the EFF has this morning started an illegal protest in Midvaal by barricading the R59 and have violently threatened community members who did not want to take part in the protest. The protests in Pielsfarm are not about failure of service delivery in Midvaal, as we have achieved the following: – In the long-term, approved a housing development called The Grace that seeks to provide housing and better service delivery by targeting the following communities: Pielsfarm, Khayelistha and Boitumelo. – In the short-term, Under the Phase 1 roll out of the Extension Services to Informal Settlements on Private Property we did the following: – Stabilized 24 hours water provision and access by linking them to the water network and Installed Enviro-Loo toilets and improved access to sanitation. This illegal protest action which prevented road users from getting to work on time and intimidation of community members shows their contempt for the progress of all South Africans, we will act to ensure that no further chaos occurs. Through our constant communication with law enforcement authorities, six arrests have been made and the investigation into continued unrest is still under way. We will continue to keep making progress in Midvaal and put the safety of our residents first.	1
NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks declined on Monday as each of the major Wall Street indexes retreated from a record, weighed down by a drop in technology and industrial shares. General Electric (GE.N), down 6.3 percent, suffered its biggest one-day percentage decline in more than six years after a host of brokerages cut their price targets on the stock, citing higher chances of a dividend cut at the industrial conglomerate. After holding near the unchanged mark for most of the session, losses accelerated late in the session on downturn in technology .SPLRCT, off 0.40 percent. Last week, the Dow and S&P managed to close at a record high all five days, after a strong start to third-quarter earnings and on hopes President Donald Trump's tax plans move forward after the Senate's approval of a budget resolution on Friday. "On the one hand, the market is very extended, overbought, on the other hand so far earnings have come through," said Andrew Slimmon, portfolio manager at Morgan Stanley Investment Management in Chicago. "The question becomes what happens if tax reform doesn't happen in 2017, does the market sell off into the year-end?" Investors are also waiting for news on the next Federal Reserve chief. Trump told reporters on Monday he is "very, very close" to making his decision on who should chair the Fed. FILE PHOTO: The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) is pictured in New York City, New York, U.S., August 2, 2017. REUTERS/Carlo Allegri/File Photo Of the 97 S&P 500 companies that have reported earnings so far, 73.2 percent have topped expectations, according to Thomson Reuters data, versus the 72-percent average for the past four quarters. The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell 54.25 points, or 0.23 percent, to 23,274.38, the S&P 500 .SPX lost 10.19 points, or 0.40 percent, to 2,565.02 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 42.23 points, or 0.64 percent, to 6,586.83. Industrials .SPLRCI, were off 0.8 percent as one of the biggest drags to the S&P of the 11 major sectors. Aside from GE, the group was also pulled lower by a 10.4-percent tumble in Arconic (ARNC.N) after the specialty metals maker missed profit estimates and announced a new chief executive. The energy index .SPNY stumbled 0.59 percent, driven by losses in Schlumberger (SLB.N), Baker Hughes (BHGE.N) and Halliburton (HAL.N), which reported results on Monday. Hasbro (HAS.O) plunged 8.6 percent after the toymaker's forecast for the holiday season fell below estimates as Toys'R'Us bankruptcy began to hurt its operations. Shares of peer Mattel (MAT.O) fell 3.2 percent. The S&P 500 posted 91 new 52-week highs and 6 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 104 new highs and 41 new lows. About 5.84 billion shares changed hands in U.S. exchanges, compared with the 5.83 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions. (The story removes extraneous punctuation in paragraph 5)	1

At the workplace, Indian millennials are faced with more than just simple work pressure. More than 40% of respondents to an online survey by a Harvard Business Review digital learning platform said that excessive workload was the main barrier to efficiency at the workplace. Office politics, cited by just over 39% of respondents, was a close second. Harvard Business Review (HBR) Ascend surveyed approximately 1,700 people aged between 18 and 34 from various industries in India to understand the challenges they encounter at work. Among millennials, "the more tenured group (aged between 25-34) felt that excessive workload is their top barrier (42.92% respondents), while the younger millennials (18-24 years) identified office politics (42.39% of the respondents) as the main pain point," Vivek Chachra, India manager, Harvard Business Publishing, noted in a press release. The workload was a bigger concern for men, while it was office politics for women, the survey found. It is important to note, however, that women represented a smaller proportion (22.17%) of the entire pool. Moreover, though most Indian millennials are equipped with technical skills, the survey suggests that they lack four key building blocks for a successful career: emotional intelligence, stress management, persuasion, and analytical thinking. Only 13% of the respondents thought they displayed emotional intelligence at work. A dismal 8% felt analytical thinking "is an area of strength for them," and a meagre 4.5% "agreed that they had the persuasion skills needed to be successful at the workplace," the survey noted. In systems plagued by rote learning, academic excellence has always been the top, if not the only, priority. Consequently, soft skills have taken a backseat at schools and higher education institutes in India. And HBR Ascend isn't alone in noting such a deficit. Studies by the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry and global management consultancy Hay Group have found that a lack of soft skills has impeded communication, self-awareness, and self-management among India's workforce. And the struggle is likely to worsen as office landscapes change. "Soft skills like empathy, emotional intelligence, and persuasion will be even more critical as workspaces become more dynamic and machine-human interplay rapidly evolves," Amit Aggarwal, senior vice-president of learning & development at Genpact, a global business process management and services firm, said in a statement.	1

If you have an iPhone 7, you should download the latest version of iOS now. Apple just released an iOS update for iPhone 7 and 7 Plus devices, which fixes a bug that apparently caused some users to "temporarily lose cellular connectivity." This is the second iOS 10 update that has addressed issues with cellular connectivity. Previously, during the initial iOS 10 rollout, T-Mobile reported a bug that caused some iPhone 6 and iPhone SE users to lose signal. Apple later addressed that bug in a subsequent update. The latest iOS update includes other bug fixes as well, though Apple hasn't elaborated on them. The iOS 10.0.3 update includes the same security content as the iOS 10.0.1 update, according to Apple's website. Despite these issues, though, iOS 10 is seeing wide adoption just a few weeks after its formal release. The update is already installed on more than half of iOS devices, according to the latest numbers from Cupertino, and third-party estimates suggest adoption has been growing rapidly as well. Though an important update, iPhone 7 owners will still need to wait a little longer for an iOS update that brings new features to their phones. Notably, a forthcoming update will bring a new Portrait Mode to iPhone 7 Plus devices later this year. That update is currently part of the iOS 10 beta release, which suggests it should be getting an official release soon.	1
At a site near the Southwest Alaska village of Quinhagak archaeologists are racing against time to uncover Yup'ik artifacts before the effects of climate change cause them to erode into the sea. The old village continues to reveal artifacts that give a glimpse into the daily lives of Yup'ik people hundreds of years ago. The crowning artifact found this season, says Rick Knecht, the lead archaeologist and a professor from the University of Aberdeen in Scotland, is a mask — half human, half walrus — in nearly perfect condition. It's wrapped in several layers of plastic as Knecht keeps the mask damp and cool in a refrigerator at base camp. "It's got amazingly lifelike contours with the cheek bones, and the nose, and the forehead and so on. Beautifully carved out of wood, and as you can see it's got two little conical tusks that represent that transformation into a walrus. And these are in fact made out of walrus ivory. It's got a little beard here, and half of it are human hairs and then on the other half are sea mammal hairs, maybe walrus whiskers," said Knecht.  Knecht says the mask could have been a used by a Shaman. He unearthed it, about five miles outside Quinhagak, on the edge of the Bering Sea, where archaeologists have spent the six field seasons scraping dirt from the remains of a 500-year old Alaska Native sod house. Today's discovery of a wooden bowl gives another clue about how Yup'ik people lived. "On the bottom of the bentwood bowl is an ownership mark left by the person who carved that and these ownership marks were inherited between families. We have about six or seven ownership marks we see consistently throughout this site, which we believe was a very large sod house divided up into compartments which were domestic spaces for women and children," said Knecht. His team has found tens of thousands of household items, jewelry and weapons, among other things. The dig is composed of what's left of an entire village at the site of the ancient community of Arolik. The objects look much younger than the centuries they've endured. That's because they've been encased in permafrost. Wood and leather items can survive for hundreds of years. The oldest objects date as far back as seven hundred years. Unseasonably warm temperatures at the dig site– nearly 80 degrees- create another set of variables for the crew to deal with. Conditions that Knecht say are driving the crew to work as fast as possible before more washes away. In the early 1600s, right around the time that Shakespeare was publishing plays and poems in England, Knecht says, these people were crafting art too: carving intricate ivory jewelry and weaving baskets. Then, in the middle of the 17thCentury, says Knecht, their communal, sod house was attacked and burned. Carlotta Hillerdal is a co-investigator with Knecht on the project. Back at the dig, she points to a burnt orange streak running along the dark soil of the dig's dirt wall. "This site was abandoned around 1640. So that's where we have the kind of orange and black soil that you see in the wall over there that we dug. That's the roof of the last phase of the structure that stood here that was burnt down and abandoned," said Hillerdal. The evidence at the site corresponds with local Yup'ik lore about the 'bow and arrow wars,' a time of fighting between tribes during an earlier climate change that strained resources. Those are stories that Yup'ik elder Annie Cleveland knows. She says, when she was a girl, she remembers walking on the beach just outside of her village and finding old spears and human remains along the shore. "When my grandmother and I used to walk down the beach to get some driftwood or pick berries we used to find spear-anek (spears) and maybe a human bone and skull and we used to put the bones back up there and dig a little bit and cover them," said Cleveland. That spot where she and her grandmother kept reburying things has turned into the dig called Nunalleq, meaning 'old village'. Cleveland says the project is bringing to life history for Yup'ik people in her village and giving them a sense of pride. The Native corporation in Quinhagak eventually wants to develop eco-tourism around the site, but rapid erosion has made getting artifacts out the priority. As they dig, researchers are finding that the village is larger than expected. With the new discoveries they've tacked on another season of fieldwork to unearth more history before it's too late. The archaeologists will ship the artifacts to Scotland for study and preservation before they return them to the region. Tribal leaders say	1
A smorgasbord of early concept art and animation detailing Naughty Dog's early vision for Uncharted has been revealed. In a feature at The Verge, Uncharted writer Josh Scherr goes over Naughty Dog's thought process at the time and includes the original pitch video for Uncharted - then codenamed Project Big - that sold the title to Sony. As you can see from the screenshot below, Nathan Drake sure looked a lot different in these early stages. His face was more plucky, cartoonish and expressive. Then the studio cast a then unknown character actor named Nolan North for the part and everything changed. "When Nolan came in, it was fairly clear that he was going to be the one," Scherr reminisced. "He had that right kind of devil may care feel to his voice, but he could also get serious when he needed to. And most importantly, as we discovered, is that the guy was hilarious." North was also able to provide motion capture and he had the perfect physicality for the role. One of the features Scherr was most proud of was "additive animation" meaning the animations would change based on context. For example, Drake sprints differently when he's being shot at versus when he's not. In danger, he'll panic and flail his arms around wildly whereas when he's leisurely running he'll remain cool and collected. "It looks very simple now compared to [how it looked] back then," Scherr said. "But we were doing a lot of things that we had never tried before." Not everything from the pitch video made it into the final game. The underwater bits were cut, as was the multi-enemy hand-to-hand combat system where you could steal weapons from foes. Amazingly, the jet ski level was built in less than a month at the 11th hour. Naughty Dog's biggest aspiration with Uncharted was design a game where the narrative was front and center, rather than a flimsy excuse for action sequences. "The thing that we wanted to focus on from the get-go were characters and story," Scherr said. "That was something we felt that - particularly back in 2005, 2006 when this first started getting developed - was something that was sort of an afterthought in the majority of video games out there. So we really wanted not only to tell this pulpy, action adventure-style thing, but also really try to develop some relatable, entertaining characters and have the story be what pulled you through the game." Uncharted: The Nathan Drake Collection will be out on 9th October and will include access to the Uncharted 4 multiplayer beta running from 4th-13th December.	1

One of the women accusing WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange of sex crimes appears to have worked with a group that has connections to the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). James D. Catlin, a lawyer who recently represented Assange, said the sex assault investigation into the WikiLeaks founder is based on claims he didn't use condoms during sex with two Swedish women. SPONSORED Swedish prosecutors told AOL News last week that Assange was not wanted for rape as has been reported, but for something called "sex by surprise" or "unexpected sex." One accuser, Anna Ardin, may have "ties to the US-financed anti-Castro and anti-communist groups," according to Israel Shamir and Paul Bennett, writing for CounterPunch. While in Cuba, Ardin worked with the Las damas de blanco (the Ladies in White), a feminist anti-Castro group. Professor Michael Seltzer pointed out that the group is led by Carlos Alberto Montaner who is reportedly connected to the CIA. Shamir and Bennett also describe Ardin as a "leftist" who "published her anti-Castro diatribes (see here and here) in the Swedish-language publication Revista de Asignaturas Cubanas put out by Misceláneas de Cuba." Shamir and Bennett noted that Las damas de blanco is partially funded by the US government and also counts Luis Posada Carriles as a supporter. A declassified 1976 document (.pdf) revealed Posada to be a CIA agent. He has been convicted of terrorist attacks that killed hundreds of people. Ardin is "a gender equity officer at Uppsula University – who chose to associate with a US funded group openly supported by a convicted terrorist and mass murderer," FireDogLake's Kirk James Murphy observed. In August, Assange told Al-Jazeera that the accusations were "clearly a smear campaign." "We have been warned that, for example, the Pentagon is planning on using dirty tricks to destroy our work," Assange told the Swedish daily newspaper Aftonbladet. The WikiLeaks founder said he was told to be careful of "sex traps." Had Assange fallen for one of those traps? "Maybe. Maybe not," he said. Catlin observed that both Ardin and Sofia Wilén, the second accuser, sent SMS messages and tweets boasting of their conquests following the alleged "rapes." "In the case of Ardin it is clear that she has thrown a party in Assange's honour at her flat after the 'crime' and tweeted to her followers that she is with the 'the world's coolest smartest people, it's amazing!'" he wrote. "The exact content of Wilén's mobile phone texts is not yet known but their bragging and exculpatory character has been confirmed by Swedish prosecutors. Niether Wilén's nor Ardin's texts complain of rape," Catlin said. Ardin has also published a seven step guide on how to get revenge on cheating boyfriends. When the charges were first leveled in August, Gawker raised doubts that Ardin was working for the CIA. "If anything, Ardin's outing tends to undercut Assange's conspiracy theory that one of his accusers is a major figure on Sweden's left fringe, freewheelingly indiscreet on her personal blog and, until her charges, an enthusiastic promoter of Assange's visit to the country," Gawker wrote. After Interpol issued a digital "wanted" poster for Assange on Monday morning, an unnamed Scotland Yard source reportedly told Press Association it had been given the documents needed for the arrest. Police would not comment on the report publicly. Several British news outlets speculated that Assange could be arrested as early as Tuesday. On Monday evening, Mark Stephens, Assange's London lawyer, was negotiating with British authorities over an arrest warrant they'd received from their Swedish counterparts. Assange has vowed to fight extradition.	1
Kristen Bell had no idea the commotion she would cause with husband Dax Shepard when she recorded her voice cameo for iZombie. The Veronica Mars alum is reuniting with series creator Rob Thomas on his new series by lending her voice for Episode 11, titled "Fifty Shades of Grey Matter." In the episode, Liv (Rose McIver) eats the brain of a poisoned librarian, voiced by Bell, who was also secretly an erotic fiction writer. "[Thomas] said, 'Just record it on your phone, send it to me and we'll lay it into the episode,'" Bell said in a conference call with reporters. "I was sitting in my husband's trailer while he was shooting [his new movie] CHiPs while both my kids were sleeping in the bedroom of the trailer, and I was like, 'Oh, I have a moment away from them! I'll get it done.' So I wrote out my lines, which was a paragraph or two of erotica. I recorded it on my phone and sent it to Rob." It wasn't until Bell and Shepard were home later that night when she realized she accidentally set something in motion. "Dax starts to tell me that the weirdest thing happened to him at work. Somebody slipped him a piece of erotica into his trailer, and he was confused as to who did it," Bell said. "He was trying to find out who wanted him to read their stuff, because he's a writer and he passes stuff onto other writers. He was utterly confused, and thank God he told me about it, because otherwise he would have thought someone on the set of CHiPs was writing erotica and slipping it into his trailer in the hopes that he was enjoying it or give notes or become his protégé? I don't know. He was like, 'One of these PAs or other writers on the set, someone slipped me some of their work… and it was really sexy!'" Bell reveals she briefly considered letting him believe someone on set was slipping him their provocative writing before eventually owning up to it. "As he was telling me, I was like, 'Should I let him know that was me, or should I let him think that some gorgeous PA was inspired to write erotica and slipped it under the door of his trailer?'" Bell said with a laugh. "The funniest part was that he went all Veronica Mars trying to figure the origin of this erotica. He said, 'I'm looking at it, it's written on a piece of paper, it's just sitting there in my trailer, and I noticed that it's written in shorthand. The person who wrote it used the number two instead of the word 'to,' and the letter 'B' instead of the word 'be.' What I'm going to do is look over the shoulder of anyone who's writing on a notepad on set for the next couple of weeks and see if I can find who is writing in shorthand.' He turned into Veronica Mars to try to figure out the origin of this erotica. It was very funny." Both Bell and Shepard were impressed with what Thomas was able to put together for the episode. "It was particularly amusing, especially knowing that my friend Rob had written things like, 'heaving breasts pressed against the cold plastic of the airplane door,'" Bell said with a laugh. "It was bizarre." Bell knew that it was only a matter of time (and scheduling) before she became involved with iZombie in some way, although she laments that she only had the time to do a voiceover cameo for the episode. "Friendship is something that's permanently on the books for Rob and I," Bell said. "There's a constant dialogue about projects and when we can work together again." That could even include another installment of Veronica Mars, which most recently spawned a movie in 2014. However, it sounds like Veronica's next act will bring her back to the small screen. "We're definitely still looking for the windows where we could allow Veronica to exist again, whether it's a miniseries or a short-run cable series," Bell said. "The business of this business twists it all a little bit when you are only allowed to do one television series at a time. It's tricky. But we haven't dropped the conversation. It just might end up being a Murder, She Wrote where I'm 80." iZombie airs Tuesdays at 9 p.m. on The CW.	1

by Jason Stotts I think that Leonard Peikoff has done some great things for Objectivism, he is like a demi-Aquinas, but when he talks about sex and sexual issues, it makes me really sad. Frankly, his position on rape is both disgraceful and disgusting. I don't know how anyone of good moral character or intelligence could actually advocate what Peikoff advocated. It is made much worse because Peikoff is someone I respect and I did not expect him to hold such a reprehensible view of rape. I'm referring, of course, to his recent Podcast question, episode 202 from February 5th, where Peikoff responds to this question: Is it rape if you obtain sex through fraudulent means? For example a man does not love a woman but tells her he does so that she will have sex with him. Is this the moral equivalent of rape? His response is: Well, if all she needs it three words, "I love you," and you're not saying it, then it's not an issue of rape. You have to determine, here — before you talk about rape — what is the context. A woman can give her consent by her presence in certain contexts and that frees the man to have sex regardless of what she then says. I'm thinking of that case of Kobe Bryant where the woman came up some time in the middle of the night, after some drinking, to his bedroom and then when he purported to do something she said, "No, I don't consent." You cannot do that. You have given every evidence that that is what you're going to do and it is too late at that point to say, "Sorry, but no." So, we're assuming it's not that type of case. You actually have created some kind of false identity, she falls for it, and she never would have [had sex with you] otherwise. Well, that's obviously deception. So, in a sense, it is like rape because she is engaging in the act without her actual consent. Without her knowledge means she would not consent to what you're doing, so you're using fraud, and it is a form of having sex by force. But I don't think you could ever make that a legal crime. Because she says she thought you loved her, but you say you didn't say you loved her. But if it came to the law case, how are you going to decide? What is objective? If a woman says, "He told me that he loved me and he didn't!" Any defendant can say, "I indicated that I had a great admiration for her otherwise I wouldn't want to sleep with her, et cetera, et cetera," there is no way of adjudicating what emotions he did or didn't feel or what conversation he did or didn't have. But if there is evidence of physical violence, you know, of a context [such as] she didn't know him, she was walking down the street, et cetera. That's a different story. So. that's what I would say. It's fraud, but in the form you present it is not a legal case. I want to focus, primarily, just on his one claim: A woman can give her consent by her presence in certain contexts and that frees the man to have sex regardless of what she then says. I'm thinking of that case of Kobe Bryant where the woman came up some time in the middle of the night, after some drinking, to his bedroom and then when he purported to do something she said, "No, I don't consent." You cannot do that. You have given every evidence that that is what you're going to do and it is too late at that point to say, "Sorry, but no." And to make it very clear what I'm objecting to: A woman can give her consent by her presence in certain contexts and that frees the man to have sex regardless of what she then says. Leonard Peikoff believes that if a woman were to come to a man's house late at night, dressed sexily, and perhaps drunk, that he should just be able to use her a fuck-toy, even if she says no. Even if she says no. He thinks that the context is sufficient consent and that any other consent is unnecessary. Furthermore, he believes that this consent cannot be withdrawn, which is the most troubling part of his claim. I agree with Peikoff that a woman in the context described above is communicating something: that she is amenable to sex. I don't even think that one needs to get explicit verbal consent here. I think it would be sufficient to start initiating sexually and see if she responds and take her response as consent. I think it's fair to say that she's consented to at least being propositioned, whether verbally or nonverbally,	1
President Trump says he has created 600,000 jobs so far. It's a false statement. "We've created over 600,000 jobs already over a very short period of time and it's going to really start catching on now," Trump said Tuesday at the White House, flanked by his top advisers and the CEOs who are members of his Business Advisory Council. He repeated the statement later at a press conference: "Already we've created more than almost [sic] 600,000 jobs." Official government data does not back up that claim. According to CNNMoney's Trump Jobs Tracker, 317,000 jobs have been created since Trump took office. The president is trying to take credit for nearly double that number of jobs. The ultimate authority on how many jobs are created (or lost) each month is the US Labor Department. CNNMoney's 317,000 figure includes how many jobs the Labor Department reported were created in February (219,000) and March (98,000). A White House spokesman said Trump is including all the job added in January as well (216,000). Trump was only in office for 11.5 days that month. But even if you give him all of the gains for January, that still only brings the tally to 533,000 jobs created so far in 2017. The math doesn't quite add up to 600,000. Related: Check the data yourself with The CNNMoney Trump Jobs Tracker Trump likes to count job promises There's ongoing debate over whether a president should take credit for creating jobs at all. Most of the hiring is done by the private sector. But there's a case to be made that government policies on taxes, regulations, trade, etc. do influence whether businesses want to hire or not. "The president's comments touting the administration's economic record accurately reflect the growing optimism about his policies and the future outlook for the country," a White House spokesman told CNNMoney. Trump has frequently said he's influenced companies like Ford, Charter Communications, General Motors and ExxonMobil to hire more workers, even though some of the businesses themselves refuse to give Trump credit for their hiring decisions. Then there's the fact that some of the jobs these companies are touting as new hires are part of projects that were in the works long before Trump was elected. (CNNMoney has a running fact check of these announcements here). Related: U.S. unemployment drops to 4.5%, lowest in decade Trump vs. Obama The bottom line is: Yes, business and consumer optimism has picked up since Trump won the election. That is likely a factor in some hiring decisions by businesses. But the reality is the economy has added an average of 178,000 jobs a month so far this year. That's very close to, and even slightly lower than, the average last year (187,000 a month) when President Obama was in office.	1

Overview Just because you're dieting, doesn't mean you can't live a little! And whether you like a glass of wine with dinner or a cocktail out with friends, watching your carbohydrate intake doesn't necessarily mean your indulging needs to come to a full stop. There are many low-carb options out there for dieters who like to drink. As with everything, moderation is key. Heavy drinking isn't good for anyone, but having a few carb-conscious cocktails here and there won't hurt. This is especially true when you consider that some of the drinks that made our top 10 list are 100 percent carb-free! Why so much liquor? When it comes to low-carb alcohol, distilled spirits are the safest bet. They're virtually all free of carbohydrates, so you only need to worry about what you're mixing them with. But not everyone likes drinking hard liquor, so we've included some dieter-friendly beers and wines, too. Diet Jack and Coke Obviously, a regular cola would shatter your daily carbohydrate allowance. But diet soda lends itself to numerous carb-free cocktails. This spin on the traditional Jack and Coke simply uses Diet Coke instead. Make! Mix one jigger (1.5 ounces) of whiskey with Diet Coke, and pour over ice. estimated calories (per serving): 100 estimated carbohydrates (per serving): 0 grams Cuba Libre When you're using diet cola, you can make any simple favorite low-carb. Despite its sweet flavor, rum doesn't contain any carbs either. Make! Mix your favorite unflavored rum with diet cola and serve over ice. For an added twist, throw in a piece of lime. estimated calories: 100 estimated carbohydrates (with a twist of lime): <1 gram Carb-free gin and tonic Gin and tonics are great summertime drinks. They're crisp and cool, but tonic water is loaded with carbs. It contains 32 grams per 12-ounce can! Swap out soda water for your tonic, and you'll get the flavor without hurting your diet efforts. Make! Mix one jigger of gin with soda water, add a squeeze of lemon or lime, and serve over ice. estimated calories: 150 estimated carbohydrates: <1 gram Low-carb mojito The traditional mojito uses syrup for sweetening, but if you use a diet lemon-lime soda like Diet Sierra Mist or Diet Sprite, you can get the sweetness without the carbs. Make! Mix one jigger of rum with fresh lime juice and diet lemon-lime soda, and pour onto muddled mint leaves. Then pour over ice. estimated calories: 110 estimated carbohydrates: 1.5 grams Michelob ULTRA Beer doesn't typically make it onto low-carb lists because most kinds are loaded with carbohydrates. Some light beers, however, won't hurt your efforts too much, including Michelob ULTRA. estimated calories: 95 estimated carbohydrates: 2.6 grams Wine Remember, a single glass of wine is about 5 ounces. Pinot grigio If you like your wine cold and refreshing, pinot grigio is a good option without too many carbohydrates. estimated calories: 123 estimated carbohydrates: 3 grams Sauvignon blanc Sauvignon blanc also earns a place on your low-carb wine rack. estimated calories: 120 estimated carbohydrates: 3 grams Red wine If red wine is more your style, pinot noir is another excellent low-carb option. estimated calories: 122 estimated carbohydrates: 3.4 grams Beck's Premier Light If you need a little more flavor with your bubbles, Beck's light beer might do the trick! It's another one of the beer hall's lower-carb options. estimated calories: 63 estimated carbohydrates: 3.8 grams Low-carb sea breeze A sea breeze is a fruity, summertime drink, but it doesn't have to be filled with sugar. Traditionally, it's made with grapefruit juice, but using Diet Squirt instead eliminates the extra carbs. Make! Mix 1 jigger of vodka with 2 ounces of unsweetened cranberry juice and 4 ounces of Diet Squirt. Pour over ice. estimated calories: 110 estimated carbohydrates: 6 grams Read more: Low-calorie cocktails »	1
The UESPWiki – Your source for The Elder Scrolls since 1995 Enar Releth, a Mouth Mouth is the term used for the spokesperson of a Telvanni Mage Lord. The Telvanni Council House is the assembly for Telvanni wizard affairs in Sadrith Mora, the Mage Lords themselves are far too busy and couldn't be bothered with mundane affairs, hence they have their Mouths present instead. A somewhat justified fear of assassination by rivals may play into this as well. If you kill a Telvanni Mage Lord their mouth will disappear too. Fast Eddie may become your Mouth when you advance to the rank of Spellwright in House Telvanni.	1
2018 Webinars Charting your Course: Developing a Personal Strategic Plan Wednesday, October 3, 2018 at 3 p.m. ET Free for NAPA members, $10 for AAA members, $50 for nonmembers Click here to register Presenter: Melissa Vogel, PhD Professor of Anthropology Director, Business Anthropology Program Clemson University As higher education administration continues to be heavily influenced by business practices, and employment opportunities for anthropologists are more often found in the private sector, it is essential that individual anthropologists start thinking more strategically about their career paths and how they intersect with their own personal and professional goals. Graduate programs often expose students to only one, narrowly defined path that nearly always leads to a tenured faculty position at a research university, yet few will actually reach this goal and many more may not want to. This webinar is designed to help you identify your short and long-term goals and create a step-by-step plan on how to achieve those goals. Participants will also be encouraged to explore a wide range of career possibilities and to incorporate their concerns for work-life balance and job satisfaction. This webinar is relevant to anthropologists from all subfields and career stages, from students to mid-career professionals. Immigration in the Trump Era Wednesday, May 2, 2018 In a time when the core anthropological values of multiculturalism, cross-cultural understanding, international diversity, and racial inclusion are under threat, many anthropologists are reflecting deeply upon our roles as teachers, researchers, and engaged scholars. In this webinar we follow from our recent Cultural Anthropology Hot Spots series to discuss our work alongside immigrant communities and undocumented students as forms of solidarity or acompañamiento and as acts of resilience and resistance as we adapt to the current political moment.

Hydra Slayer 18.0 Hydra Slayer 18.0 is released on Steam and itch.io ! Hydra Slayer is a roguelike with a unique combat system, based on old matematical puzzles. The highlights of release 18.0 are the following: A new player race, the Atlanteans . Most characters in Hydra Slayer would meet vulture hydras, who grow one head for every wound they deal to the player. The Atlanteans have been cursed by the gods, and this will happen for all hydras. Will you be able to turn your curse into an advantage? The curse significantly affects the equipment and strategies to use, especially in the first 12 levels. Thanks for Patashu and Nick for the idea! Evolving hydras . They start to appear after level 25. Their resistance to the given weapon material is increased by one after each attack. These are inspired by a (slightly trollish) post by IchigoMait. Previously, each level below Level 12 contained just one special hydra (not counting bloody or dragon variants of standard colors) -- since there are 9 types, some of them will appear just a few times. The new version changes this -- some levels will replace one of the standard ones with another special, and some will almost lack normal hydras and include most of the special types instead. Challenge levels now tend to have two special hydras per level too. One new exotic weapon -- I will leave that for the players to find :) New special graphics for scythes (Atlanteans start with a scythe), hecatoncheires and monkeys. Thanks to tehora for requesting these! Removed some exploits. It is no longer possible to enhance the titanic club easily with the Reforging+Ambidexterity combo (thanks to vo3435 for abusing this). A tighter limit is placed on using time-daggers on mushrooms. Some features have been added to help with "head draining" attacks (all hydras for Atlanteans, Vultures for all characters). When fighting head-draining hydras, the number of wounds caused by the hydra's next attack is given in the UI. For other hydras, when you select your shield, "+1" is displayed for the hydra whose damage is reduced by your shield. Also, you can now press 'w' in the hydra description, to view the amount of wounds the given hydra would deal for every size. Enchanted Mersenne Twister (when trying to roll a 'good' number of heads) will now take into account that extra heads could be drained. In the cheat mode, shift+H can now also summon equipment. Minor bugfixes: better display of the in-game achievement screen, capital letters accepted in the scores menu, better handling of the app going out of focus, the generation of Giants' weapons in challenge games, crash bug with Vulture + Ambidexterity + Knowledge/Growth, using Twister even though runes are active, inexact calculation of wounds in the PoK algorithm by head drainers, 'use count' for traps, dragons attacking in a wrong direction on non-orientable levels, number of stunned heads is no longer displayed in the PoK hint for large hydras (the algorithm does not care about them anyway), potion of knowledge correctly counting wounds for shadows, capital letters accepted in the scores menu Have fun! Small updates will be posted on the Steam forum first. Posted by Zeno Rogue at 04:57	1
Here Is The Best Ruleset For Ultimate: Fouling Out, Stall Clock, And No More Picks I watch a lot of ultimate: college, club, AUDL, MLU, you name it. I've decided on what I think is the optimal ruleset for ultimate, combining a mish-mash of rules that already exist (this is built, like every rule book, on at least 80% of the existing USAU rules) and a few things that haven't been tried. This is the framework for rules at the highest level of the sport, and many of the features are only feasible for the most important games and tournaments. The Field The USA Ultimate rules have the field shape right. The real key is the width — 40 yards wide seems just right. It's wide enough so that the offense can change angles, but not so wide that stopping breaks and swings is impossible, as it is in the semi-pro leagues. Proponents of the football-sized field at the pro level laud the benefit of more hucking and more offense, calling it more exciting. I think that sells the spectator public short. You need a balance in every sport between offense and defense — I like watching offense-only street basketball occasionally, but I would never encourage the NBA to adopt that style. Beautiful defense — both individual and team — can be as exciting as beautiful offense, especially for the intermediate or advanced fan. The Stall Having players count to ten on the mark is obviously not the optimal way to track the stall count. It is way too inconsistent and is one of the most hotly contested calls in the game ("I said the T of ten!") But the way the pro leagues solve it — with referees counting silently and inconsistently — is not great either. The solution: a 7-second stall clock, visible to players and fans alike, operated on the sideline. A buzzer goes off if it hits zero. Disc still in the hand of the player? Turnover. A stall clock operator on the sideline presses a button to reset the clock when the disc is thrown/caught. This would be a much more consistent and exciting way to watch a stall count unfold. Officiating If you're coming here hoping for a firm stance on whether we should adopt observers or referees, you will be disappointed. From a spectator point of view, I simply don't think it matters all that much. Players seem split on what they prefer. Really, the key is to have a trained professional as the official. Whether they are making active rulings or waiting for player calls before adjudicating, there are way, way too many bad officials in ultimate right now. On the whole, the officiating is particularly bad in the AUDL, where each team slaps together a crew of local refs for each game. Like many things in the AUDL, your mileage may vary. Some cities have great refs; others, not so much. I can't believe how often you see a player throw his hands up for a foul call, then get it 3-4 seconds after the play happens. The MLU's refs are not always great, either, but they are certainly more consistent. There are some very capable observers in the USAU game, and the top tier of observers are the best trained officials in the sport. We need more of them: people who aren't afraid to make a call, who manage the physicality and call infractions when necessary, and who know the rules inside and out. Regardless, I am thoroughly convinced that top level ultimate should have officials; pure self-officiation has far too many pitfalls, especially for spectator ultimate. Fouls I think the current USA Ultimate rulebook does a great job of outlining fouls. You can't bump the thrower. You can't slash the arms of a receiver or hold them down as they try to jump. Physicality and contact in the stack is technically disallowed, but is often uncalled by players, observers, and referees alike. The rules seem to have found the sweet spot for a "non-contact" sport. Unfortunately, enforcement leaves a lot to be desired; it's probably the most glaring weakness in the current ruleset. The pro leagues have made an effort to combat fouls with a short yardage penalty, but a 10 yard penalty is so much less significant in ultimate than it is in football. USA Ultimate rules often allow players to get away with repeated, egregious fouls with almost no repercussions. The current TMF/PMF system still lacks teeth, especially when being wielded by inexperienced or timid observers. It's time to try a new approach. It would be easy to institute an individual foul limit on players in officiated games. Without in-game testing, it would be hard to know what the 'foul out' number should be, but it would serve as an effective way to stop continued	1
Stephen Colbert dropped the "L" word (lie) and the "F" word (you know) on the Trump White House on Monday night. It was the late-night comedian's latest blast of politically charged commentary — primarily directed at the 45th president. And it was the kind of performance that just a short time ago seemed to risk alienating large numbers of potential viewers but now appears to be making the "Late Show" host a very big draw. Colbert lampooned White House senior policy adviser Stephen Miller, who on his tour of the Sunday political talk shows asserted that "the powers of the president to protect our country are very substantial and will not be questioned." "Will not be questioned? Let me test that theory," Colbert said. "What the f--- are you talking about?" Colbert then challenged Miller, who said he is "prepared to go on any show, anytime, anywhere," to appear on Tuesday's "Late Show." "Listen, if you don't show up, I'm going to call you a liar," Colbert said. "And if you do show up, I'm going to call you a liar to your face." Miller did not show. With forceful remarks like this, Colbert has been gaining on late-night king Jimmy Fallon, who is far less inclined to take on the president in a harsh manner. Conventional wisdom is that Fallon's approach works best on a major broadcast network. When the Hollywood Reporter commissioned a survey of late-night viewers in the fall of 2015, shortly after Colbert's debut on CBS, it found that Fallon appealed to people across the political spectrum. The "Tonight Show" host's audience was 36 percent Democrat, 31 percent Republican and 27 percent independent. Colbert's audience skewed sharply to the left: 47 percent Democrat, 17 percent Republican and 31 percent independent. A liberal slant helped make Colbert a star on Comedy Central, but "CBS executives made it clear that they expected Mr. Colbert to broaden his appeal when he moved to the medium of late night on a network," the New York Times reported at the time of his hiring. Colbert, however, was among Trump's fiercest critics during the campaign and never really moderated his politics. Ratings throughout his first year on the "Late Show" were underwhelming, much to the delight of conservative publications such as the Weekly Standard, which in May called Colbert's early struggles "sweet schadenfreude." Former Daily Show host Stephen Colbert weighed in on the presidency of Donald Trump during an interview with CBS News' Face the Nation on Dec. 25, 2016. (Reuters) Absent another survey of late-night audiences, it is unclear what exactly has reversed Colbert's fortunes. Are liberal viewers tuning in in greater numbers? Or is Colbert bringing in conservatives who were uncomfortable with Trump during the campaign and who feel unnerved by his fledgling administration? It is worth noting that Colbert's skewering of Miller on Monday night had little to do with liberal or conservative policy ideas; it was about a claim to unchecked power, which could alarm anybody. We'll see whether Colbert can sustain his recent success. But if he was waiting for ratings to catch up to his vision for the "Late Show," his patience is being rewarded, for now.	1
Image copyright AFP Image caption Giorgio Orsoni posing with a Venetian model boat during a visit to France in February The mayor of the Italian city of Venice, Giorgio Orsoni, has resigned amid a wider investigation into alleged corruption over new flood barriers. He and 34 other officials were arrested last week on suspicion of embezzling around 20m euros ($27m, £16m) in public funds earmarked for flood defences. Mr Orsoni stepped down a day after being released from house arrest under a plea bargain. He agreed to a four-month sentence but is unlikely to go to prison. The sentence still requires court approval. Mr Orsoni had returned to his post on Thursday after a temporary suspension but it appears he lost the support of his political allies, the ruling centre-left Democratic Party, correspondents say. He had told a prosecutor he was innocent in the case. Speaking to reporters after his release from house arrest, he said he had always run Venice "in the best way possible". "I made a lot of enemies... and this is the price I am paying," he added. Delayed project Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Watch: The mobile flood barriers emerge from the water The bribery allegations centre around the public tender process for the Moses project, as the works are known in English, after their Italian acronym (Mose). Seventy-eight mobile barriers will be used to shut off Venice lagoon in the event of rising sea levels and storms. Construction began 11 years ago but has been hampered by delays in funding due to the economic crisis. The city, one of the world's great tourist destinations, is continuing to sink and is hit by flooding on a yearly basis.	1

Clinton: His role in Northern Ireland  Shortly before Bill Clinton left office, BBC News Online's Dominic Casciani examined his role in the peace process. It's a mark of the people skills of President Bill Clinton that it took his visit to unite the people of Northern Ireland, no matter how briefly, in their tens of thousands on the streets of Belfast and Londonderry. We came here knowing that words are not very good at a time like this, simply to express our sympathy and to support your determined refusal to let a cowardly crime rob you of the future President Clinton at Omagh, 1998 President Bill Clinton's domestic legacy, belittled by opponents and tainted by impeachment, will be picked over for years to come. But few doubt the importance of the role that he played in helping to get Northern Ireland's divided community to sit down together with the common goal of consigning violence and inequality to the past. President Clinton is now on his third visit to Dublin and Belfast - three visits more than any other serving US President has ever undertaken. It's a commitment that has ranged from granting Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams a US visa in the belief that it would further peace, to admitting to being left "overwhelmed" following a meeting with victims of the Omagh bomb. Although the peace process is by no means complete, the White House has regarded it as little short of a Clinton foreign policy triumph. Origins of involvement For years, any White House desire to get involved in Northern Ireland was tempered by the relationship with London. Clinton timeline 1992: Irish Forum pledges 1994: Gerry Adams Visa 1994: George Mitchell Appointed 1995: First visit 1998: Key role in Good Friday Agreement 1998: Second visit 2000: Farewell visit During his White House campaign in 1992, the then Governor Clinton of Arkansas made a pledge to send a peace envoy, something that the majority of the politically influential Irish-American caucus had long sought. The commitment risked infuriating London and following election, Clinton appeared to have dropped the pledge - appointing only an "economic envoy", Senator George Mitchell. Coupled with the new US ambassador to Dublin, Jean Kennedy Smith, sister of Clinton's hero President John F Kennedy, the two appointments began a process that would see the US strengthen its involvement in the emerging peace process. Treading a fine line Clinton's approach to Northern Ireland appeared to mirror that of many of his domestic policies - appeal to all sides and seek consensus. His second policy plank was to encourage US companies to bring much-needed economic investment to Northern Ireland. But it was a fine line to follow. In 1994, President Clinton angered London, the US's closest ally, by granting a US visa to Gerry Adams. Despite accusations of being soft on terrorism and opposition among some of his own people, Clinton saw it another way. Only by including the republicans could they be encouraged to leave violence behind. First visit President Clinton's first visit to Northern Ireland came in November 1995, 15 months after the IRA announced its first cease-fire. He was greeted by tens of thousands of people lining the streets. After famously shaking hands with Gerry Adams on Belfast's Falls Road (the exact location now features in the official Belfast bus tour), he went on to receive a rapturous reception when he turned on the Christmas tree lights in Belfast city centre. Clinton appeared to fire the imagination of many people in Northern Ireland, appearing both statesmanlike, non-partisan and folksy at the same time. The Adams handshake may have drawn unionist criticism, but the president treated him no differently to the political representatives of the loyalist paramilitaries - he would back those he saw as leaving violence behind. From talks to agreement George Mitchell's subsequent appointment as the honest broker between all sides in the developing talks, the de facto peace envoy Clinton had promised in 1992, is regarded by many as the president's single most important foreign policy decision of his administration. It not only provided a respected and impartial figure to chair talks, but it effectively guaranteed the White House's involvement in helping to find a political settlement in Northern Ireland, between the north and the south and Dublin and London. Throughout the 1998 talks, there were frequent telephone calls from the Oval Office to the main players - culminating in a round of late-night contacts in the days leading up to the deadline. Mr Clinton never saw his role as a guarantor of a deal - but it was certainly his intention to be an enabler, encouraging compromise and exerting pressure at the same time. Mr Clinton's second visit to Northern Ireland, following the dissident republican bombing of Omagh, came as the president was facing increasing domestic pressures at home. He appeared visibly moved following a meeting with some of those who survived the bombing - but stressed to all of Northern Ireland that it was "up to you" to find the solutions. Difficult, sometimes wrenching decisions lie ahead but they must be made," he said. "The spirit of reconciliation must be rooted in all you do." The future A question mark now hangs over future American policy. No	1
Ten years ago a visionary named Vinod Khosla gave a presentation called Biofuels: Think Outside the Barrel. It seems to have disappeared from his Khosla Ventures website, but you can find an archived version here. In that presentation Mr. Khosla outlined his vision for biofuels. He projected that ethanol produced from biomass – aka "cellulosic ethanol" – would scale up rapidly. From zero commercial production in 2006, Khosla foresaw the first 100 million gallons of cellulosic ethanol hitting the market in 2008 (see Slide 78), ramping rapidly to 2.5 billion gallons in 2011, 14.6 billion gallons in 2015, and ultimately 173 billion gallons per year by 2030. Combined with corn ethanol production, he believed cellulosic ethanol could totally end U.S. dependence on petroleum for transportation fuel – but he needed to get the government on board to foot some costs. Khosla addressed potential obstacles in his presentation. Certainly cellulosic ethanol wouldn't fail because of technology. There were too many companies working on it. The magic of Moore's Law and black swans would be the ticket to success. (As an aside, he doesn't seem to understand the black swan theory, as he frequently cites these "high-profile, hard-to-predict, and rare events" as an expected outcome). The only real barrier he could identify was those despicable oil companies, who had to be shaking in their boots that this 100-year old upstart technology would spell their demise. But he would deal with the oil companies through legislation by forcing them to purchase this product that had yet to be commercialized. So he lobbied, and he testified before Congress. He lost a vote or two, but he was instrumental in getting cellulosic ethanol mandates included in the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) in the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. The EPA was charged with implementing the RFS, and they based the mandated volumes on the amount that potential cellulosic ethanol producers claimed they would be able to produce. For 2010 the EPA was counting on 100 million gallons of cellulosic fuels based on claims primarily from two companies associated with Vinod Khosla: Range Fuels and Cello Energy. This is ground that has been amply covered here before. Range Fuels and Cello Energy both went out of business after spending hundreds of millions of dollars — including taxpayer money — without delivering a drop of cellulosic fuel. In fact there were zero gallons of qualifying cellulosic ethanol production for 2010 and 2011. In 2012 the first qualifying batch of cellulosic ethanol was produced — 20,069 gallons by Blue Sugars Corporation. The ethanol was produced in April 2012, but that was it for the year. And Blue Sugars went out of business. There was no qualifying cellulosic ethanol produced in 2013, the year Vinod Khosla had projected 7.2 billion gallons of cellulosic ethanol production. But 2014 finally saw some qualifying production as several new plants came online. INEOS Bio and its joint venture partner New Planet Energy had announced the opening of the Indian River County BioEnergy Center in Florida in 2012. The nameplate capacity of this plant was 8 million gallons of cellulosic ethanol per year. The House Committee on Agriculture was told in 2012 "The biorefinery is a major landmark for this country. It's the first commercial cellulosic refinery." But the EPA doesn't show any production from anyone in 2012 or 2013, and in December 2013 the company issued a press release that said in part: "Bringing the facility on-line and up to capacity has taken longer than planned due to several unexpected start-up issues at the Center. These efforts have highlighted some needed modifications and upgrades." Another update from them in 2014 cast doubt that they would ever produce any ethanol. On July 7, 2011 the U.S. Department of Energy had announced a $105 million loan guarantee to POET for the development of its 25 million gallon per year corn cob-to-ethanol facility, dubbed Project Liberty, at Emmetsberg, Iowa. POET, one of the largest producers of ethanol in the world announced that they were open for commercial cellulosic ethanol production in September 2014. Cellulosic ethanol production had been slated to begin in May 2013, but more than a year later than projected Jeff Broin, POET Founder and Executive Chairman, stated "Some have called cellulosic ethanol a 'fantasy fuel,' but today it becomes a reality." Another company, Abengoa (NASDAQ: ABGB) built a $500 million cellulosic ethanol plant in Hugoton, Kansas. In October 2014 they announced the grand opening of the facility: "Abengoa's new industry-leading biorefinery finished construction in mid-August and began producing cellulosic ethanol at the end of September with the capacity to produce up to 25 million gallons per year." 	1
Long and confusing title, I know, but I'm desperate for help and advice. I'm full of anger and stress at the same time but I don't know what to do. I'm hormonal and can't think clearly and am honestly furious and scared that our marriage is going to fall apart. The abuse happened two years ago which is why I'm posting here but the problem is happening now. We've been married since Valentine's Day 2014. In 2015, my husband Manuel finished his Navy reserves enlistment. He has a very high paying career and about a week after being discharged, he went to his friend's party. Basically at the party, a woman named Emma started talking to him, drugged his drink, and took advantage of him. My husband found out the day after because a friend told him he found him unconscious and saw earlier Emma on top of him on the bed but didn't realize it was him until later. Manuel didn't report her because he didn't want to "ruin her life" and so the law never got involved. My husband told me what happened the day after the party and I had a mental breakdown and went to therapy because I was going to legitimately kill her. To make it worse, she got pregnant from the incident. I don't have violent thoughts anymore but at the time I was so angry that I wanted to kill her and it got worse once I found out she got pregnant from that. I felt so bad for Manuel and he was disappointed at how he was taken advantage of but it didn't seem to affect him that much. I don't know if it was because he didn't want to show emotion or if it really didn't affect him. He helps her out willingly and pays for some of her expenses and their baby's expenses. She's a pharmacy technician but since rent in our state and city is pretty high, he helps her out. He went to her delivery and even though he's extremely busy with work and our time, she drops their baby off at our apartment a lot of times in the evening since I don't allow my husband to be alone with her at all or go to her apartment and so my husband can spend time with him. I have met her but we have spoken maybe 40 words total and we're extremely cold and distant. The only reason I'm even letting this happen is because it's not the baby's fault and I don't want Manuel to not see his baby. On Saturday, Emma came to our apartment and wanted to talk to my husband. They sat down, she wanted me to leave the room to talk in private but I told her no right off the bat because I don't trust her. She legitimately told him that he needed to "step up" and "be a more active father" and "be there for our baby". She works full time and her parents help out with the babysitting . She wants their baby to spend more time with both of them together instead of just her "dropping him off like a package" and not having the baby bond with both parents at the same time. She said that Manuel also needed to be available more often since she wants Manuel to be around the baby and she wants to drop the baby off more times a week (right now it's around 2-4 times per week...the baby sometimes spends the night but mostly she comes picks him up after a few hours). She needs money for a car since her car is breaking down and she "doesn't want any problems with dropping the baby off or endangering the baby". This sounds like a load of shit to me but I want opinions. She wants Manuel to make trips to her apartment and visit the baby because sometimes she can't make the trip. In my opinion, if worse comes to worse, I'll drive and pick up the baby but I'm starting to think she might want to take advantage of him again since she desperately wants him to go to her apartment to visit their baby. She acts so shameless and her attitude was so bitchy. She was acting like Manuel was "slacking" or neglecting his duties like they were married or something. The part where she wanted me to leave the room made me extremely suspicious and I'm wondering if maybe she wants to tell him something else but didn't because I was there. I'm pregnant and when the baby comes and we have more, I obviously expect Manuel to prioritize his real children and not her or her baby. She left after a while and honestly she comes off as flirty sometimes but I don't mind since they barely see each other and he'd never do anything with her. He's very nice to her but keeps his distance with her like I want him to. I told him that absolutely not is he going to buy her a new car. He started telling me that he's going to pay for a safe and good car for her. She has money and she isn't poor. Manuel is saying that he doesn't want his baby to have a low quality car	1
Bangladeshi teachers, students and social activists protest on Friday in Dhaka against the rcent killings of atheist bloggers, academics, religious minorities. more-in Unidentified attackers hacked a Hindu tailor to death near his workplace in Gopalpur upazila of Tangail district near Dhaka on Saturday. Police and eyewitness said three young men, who came on a motorcycle, hacked Nikhil Chandra Joarder (50) and left him dead on the spot. "They came on a motorcycle and attacked him as he sat on a roadside. They hacked him on his head, neck and hand," deputy chief of Tangail district police Aslam Khan, told AFP. They also left behind a bag in which several bomb-like objects were found. A bomb disposal unit rushed to the spot . Police suspect a "derogatory" comment Joarder made about Prophet Muhammad might be the reason for the attack. Local Muslims had filed a complaint against him then. He was charged with hurting religious sentiments and spent three weeks in jail. "But the trial did not proceed after the complainants withdrew the charges," Abdul Jalil, the police chief of Gopalpur sub-district, told AFP. The Islamic State group-affiliated Aamaq news agency issued a statement saying "elements of the Islamic State stabbed to death by knife a Hindu in Tangail in Bangladesh who was known for insulting Prophet Muhammad". It did not give further details. The murder came less than a week after suspected Islamist militants hacked to death two gay rights activists in the capital Dhaka, and about 10 days after the murder of Rajshahi University professor A.F.M. Rezaul Karim Siddiquee. In February suspected Islamists had decapitated a top Hindu priest inside a temple complex in a northern district, in an attack claimed by the Islamic State group. The attack was similar to recent killings of atheist bloggers, academics, religious minorities and most recently a gay rights activist in Bangladesh by radical Islamists. Five people have already been killed in such attacks this year and nine were killed last year. Meanwhile, Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina on Saturday blamed the "nexus" between the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) and the Jamaat-e-Islami over the targeted killings. However Ms. Hasina hoped the people will reject such destructive politics and all such plots to destabilise the country would be foiled. Also read: Bangladesh in recent times has seen a spate of attacks on secular and liberal thought. Bloggers, journalists and students have been brutally hacked to death by fundamentalist elements in the country. This thread of violence by radical Islamists runs from the most recent murder of an English professor at Rajshahi University to the 1993, fatwa against author Taslima Nasreen following release of her book "Lajja".

John Amos is one of those actors fortunate enough to have more than one iconic role on his résumé. His two biggest parts were as patriarch James Evans Sr. on Good Times and as the elder Kunta Kinte on Roots. But he first won fame with a smaller, yet still enduring, part: Gordy the weatherman on CBS's The Mary Tyler Moore Show. Amos appeared roughly a dozen times over the course of the show's first three seasons, and even though he left to take a regular gig on Good Times in 1974, his character was vital enough that he returned with his own spotlight episode during the final season of Mary Tyler Moore. Tonight Amos can be seen talking about his experiences on the show, alongside Betty White, Valerie Harper, Ed Asner, Dick Van Dyke, and others, as part of Mary Tyler Moore: A Celebration, airing at 8 p.m. on most PBS stations. Vulture caught up with Amos by phone last week to dive deeper into his MTM days, including how the show gave him his big break as an actor and the time producers had to retaliate against a racist crew member. He also talked to us about his bumpy ride on Good Times and gave us his thoughts about next year's planned update of Roots. It's great to speak to you, Mr. Amos. You're on the East Coast now, right? How are you? I'm in Jersey. I'm fine! I want to talk to you first about The Mary Tyler Moore Show, since you're part of this new PBS tribute to Ms. Moore. Your role on MTM was sort of your first big national exposure as an actor, though you'd worked as a writer for Leslie Uggams's CBS variety show back in 1969. I read an interview with you where you talked about how you had wanted to break into performing on her show, but the producers said you couldn't do both. Why was that? Back then you were lucky to be in the business in any working capacity. The idea that I would be in there as a writer, and then want to perform, too? That was just an abstract concept to the producers at that time. They weren't ready for somebody who thought they could act and write. I had to wait until my turn came. When you say they weren't ready, was it because you were young, or because you were African-American? I think it was a bit of both. I was just getting started, and that was my first network writing job. Although I had written comedy and performed on a local television show, Lohman & Barkley, which won an Emmy. In fact, we all wrote and performed, the "we" being the entire writing staff, which consisted of Craig T. Nelson, Barry Levinson, the late McLean Stevenson, amongst others. We were all just getting started, and that was wonderful training for us. Having written and performed on a local show that did successfully, I had every reason to believe I could do that at the network level. But they said, "No, you can only do one." So how did you ultimately make the jump to performing, and to MTM? One day I had lunch with two of the writers on the [Uggams] show, Lorenzo Music and Dave Davis. And they said, "John, when you act out these sketches for our guest artists, we think you've got the chops. We're involved in the development of something called The Mary Tyler Moore Show, and we think you'd be right for one of the characters." I just took it with a grain of salt. It sounded too good to be true. But later they stayed true to their word. When The Mary Tyler Moore Show [was picked up to series], they called me. Did you have to try out for the gig? I auditioned for Mary, Grant Tinker, and the powers that be, and got the job as Gordy the weatherman. It became a recurring character. Because of The Dick Van Dyke Show, Ms. Moore was already a TV icon of sorts even before she got her own series. What was your experience working with her? The joy of working with Mary was, you knew who the star of the show was. It was The Mary Tyler Moore Show. So there were no attempts to upstage her, or any of the other things that usually go with actors surrounding the star. It was a harmonious set. She and Phyllis and Valerie got along great, because all they would talk about, all day long, was diets and health food. [Laughs.] As soon as they got to the set, the conversation would start. So they had a nice little [group] going. And they all got along great. It was a wonderful atmosphere. I felt, for the first time, that I was part of a real, meaningful ensemble. I had no idea the show was quite	1

Do not edit another editor's comment. Two War Table Quests? Edit On my current (and thus far first) playthrough, I had two options for springing Blackwall from prison. The first was "Thom Rainier's Fate", which appears to be the default option. I also had the opportunity to send Leliana in to extract him without implicating the Inquisition via the operation "Rainier's Release: An Alternative". My sister, however, did not have the secondary option. Anyone have an idea? I play a female Qunari rogue with the Underworld Knowledge Inquisition Perk, and she is a female human warrior without it, so I suspect the difference may lie there. It may, of course, be another factor entirely. HyenaSpotz (talk) 21:23, December 20, 2014 (UTC) Trigger Edit In one of my playthroughs, I completed Wicked Eyes and Wicked Hearts and Here Lies the Abyss without having completed Wardens of the Coast, and this quest just would not trigger (no matter how many times I talked to Blackwall). Only after I went to the Storm Coast and finished Wardens of the Coast did it finally trigger. So I'm wondering if that's a legitimate per-requisite or just a bug. -- Keladin Storm 21:58, February 2, 2015 (UTC)r I've always done Wardens of the Coast before doing this quest, and in my recent playthrough I did it much later than usual. This quest definitely didn't come up for me until after that, but I can't say for sure that it was the trigger. I know it's not dependant upon approval rating, and it's not dependant upon completing Memories of the Grey. -- ♫ Kelcat Talk 22:10, February 2, 2015 (UTC) I recruited Blackwall ASAP and yet this quest has never triggered and I have no idea why. It's really frustrating, because romance conversations with ultiple characters haven't triggered when I know they should. Am I gonna have to just restart the game? Mr. Mittens (talk) 01:20, June 24, 2015 (UTC) I have done all three quests now but got "Greatly Disapproves" by choosing Gaspard as Emperor without Briala. I had the fairweather friends Trial active at this time of the game so I guess I don't have enough approval now to trigger the quest.--Kendira (talk) 12:19, October 5, 2015 (UTC) Affirmed. After finishing his Memories of the Grey quest the tavern scene immediately triggered after approaching him and I found the letter at his place that starts Revelations--Kendira (talk) 12:47, October 5, 2015 (UTC) Neither Blackwalls nor Bulls personal quest are triggering for me now in any of my games my approval is high enough and I dont want to have to restart im at just about to face corpheoues at skyhold and neither quests ever happenedBlitzbear93 (talk) 20:28, September 10, 2015 (UTC)Blitz ear93 Sentenced to the Wardens... Edit If romanced, yet sentenced to the Wardens, you are given a fifth choice, which is another end relationship option, "I have no future with a Warden." My current Inquisitor, having "shitty luck in choosing lovers," couldn't let him go, so I don't know what she actually says in that regard. Shadizar666 (Ruck Rules) 03:21, July 12, 2016 (UTC)	1
It is a slider/cutter, a pitch that has been called a "slutter" by some and simply an expletive by others, mainly those trying to hit it. But it also has been one key to the ridiculous success of Cubs stud right-hander Jake Arrieta, who faces the Mets in Game 2 of the NLCS Sunday at Citi Field. "It's developed over the course of several years," Arrieta said Saturday before his Cubs fell 4-2 in Game 1. "The consistency mechanically is really where that pitch started to flourish, being able to repeat the same delivery, same arm slot on a pretty regular basis. Adjusting the velocity by tweaking the release point is really where the change in speed comes from. "That's why you'll hear it called a slider or a cutter based on different sequences to different hitters." Or, of course, a few unprintable words. Regardless, it is part of the reason Arrieta, who finished 22-6 with a 1.77 ERA, is favored to take home the Cy Young Award. Not bad for the former Oriole — he was traded in 2013 with Pedro Strop for Scott Feldman and Steve Clevenger, sort of the gods' way of evening out Milt Pappas for Frank Robinson. "It's just been some hard work and some repetition," Arrieta, 29, said of his pitch, noting his transformation from regular pitcher to All-Star began the day he joined the Cubs. "[I] reverted back to some things that I was doing successfully, and I started to do those more often … comfort things that I had in place," Arrieta said. "My arm slot, my release point became more consistent over time, and the confidence continued to rise." It rose to where Arrieta had a season that recalls the day of Bob Gibson. According to Elias Sports Bureau, he is just the fifth pitcher with at least 22 wins with a sub-2.00 ERA since ERA became an official stat before World War I (1912 in the NL, 1913 in the AL). Arrieta posted a ridiculous 0.75 ERA and was 12-1 with two shutouts in the second half, the best numbers since the All-Star Game began in 1933. And from Aug. 4 to the end of the season, he was 11-0 with a 0.41 ERA, the best numbers ever. Yeah, but he did walk 14 guys in that stretch… Manager Joe Maddon sees something different behind Arrieta's rise. "Biggest, biggest difference is fastball command, period. He knows where his fastball's going," Maddon said. Mets manager Terry Collins just pointed to the total package. "His location has just been off the charts," Collins said. "He's got this, he may call it a slider, it's this hard cutter that he's now started to command that he's eating up left-handed hitters. He locates the fastball. He moves his curveball around." Arrieta threw a career high 229 innings, but Maddon noted how much of his work was low stress because he only averaged 15-plus pitches an inning. Arrieta claimed the mental was harder than the physical. "The mental expenditure of energy," Arrieta assessed. "Throughout the course of the day you start to contemplate your routine and think about the game in different scenarios … that heart rate starts to rise a little bit." Think of the guys facing him. "The physical toll really hasn't bothered me at all," he said, "but the mental side of it and all the energy you burn leading up to the game does have a little bit of effect."	1

16 8115 Canoga Ave Los Angeles , CA 91304  (818) 348-5385 I am in the process of restoring a 1990 RX7 convertible. The car is very sentimental to me and Tri-Point has been amazing. They've taken meticulous care in their repairs. I've been driving the car to work and loving it. Thank you, Tri-Point Engineering Took my 09 Mazdaspeed 3 in to get serviced by these self proclaimed Mazda specialist, what I ended up receiving is ham-fisted, half-ass work, with 0 accountability resulting in me needing to pay another shop to fix mistakes. Services I paid for that were performed improperly: - Replaced gas cap to try and resolve Vacuum code After I took the car to get er filled up, I noticed that the gas cap that they replaced my OEM one with did not spin properly with the rubber-gasket-string that attaches it to the exterior door. Basically, you'd turn it tight and it'd rip out the rubber-gasket-string from the gas door. Obviously an inadequate gas cap was ordered as it did not fit with the factory equipment. But the worse offense was that they installed it, and I'm assuming tested it, and found it's improper fitment as passable. This is just a microcosm of the lack of attention to detail, and or pride in the work they do. I immediately took it back and they ended up shaving the rubber gasket down so it'd spin with the gas cap. I'm still experiencing the vacuum leak so this was also a misdiagnosis. -Motor-mount replacement Paid $500 to have my engine motor mount replaced (was experiencing no issues at the time but took their word for it). Well, 9k miles later, I started to hear creeks, and clacks coming from the engine bay. Turns out the motor mount they replaced was totally shot. Ended up paying $600 to have them all replaced to resolve the issue. -Replaced spark plugs Immediately after the performed the work my car would no longer start in cold weather. They insisted it had nothing to do with the work they performed but the problem only started happening after the work they performed. Well, 9k miles later, I started experiencing really rough idle. I looked on the forums and a common cause is spark plugs not being gapped properly. I took them out myself, re-gapped them to .029, and now the problem is gone. A couple were off by quite a few centimeters. What kind of shop can't gap their spark plugs properly? Other notes: It was really difficult getting ahold of them during the whole time they had my car. They don't work weekends and during the week when I'd call them I'd never get a call back for days at a time. I tried emailing them but even that it'd take forever to receive a message back. The real-deal Tri-Point is long gone. Do yourself a favor and avoid these imposters. The real Tri-Point worked on my ancient Mazda 626 and later my 1991 RX-7 GTUs. That shop is long gone. Marc Shuler and Craig Nagler (the REAL owners) were certified card carrying Mazda experts. The current owners aren't really even up to the challenge of operating. Their location looks like a wrecking yard and they rarely answer the phone. Still, I took a chance and made an "appointment" with them for an oil change. I showed up at the shop at the designated time but no one was there. To be honest, it looked they were out of business and left a bunch of partially repaired cars in their wake. I walked around and finally the guy in the shop next door called over to me and said, "He's not here." Uh, right; "he" is most obviously not here... So, I stood around for a while and then headed for home. I figured that a few minutes later I'd get a call from them explaining what was going on. Nope. Silence. After I got home I decided to call them just to follow-up and to thank them for wasting 45 minutes of my day. The guy I talked to sounded like he had just woken up. When I told him about my appointment and the fact he weren't there he said, "Well, you don't need an appointment for an oil change." Amazingly clueless. I wouldn't trust these guys to change my windshield wiper blades. They do not deserve to be doing business under the name Tri-Point Engineering. Avoid them at all costs. This is my 1990' Mazda Miata the car is one of lifes joys an who better to take care of most precious possesions in life but the very guys who do what they love as a living! Tri-Point the best in Mazda today they originally helped me bring back a 1985' RX-7 GS i had bought about 2 years ago an its	1
Loading ... Loading ... The U.S. military has had its eyes on Afghan mineral deposits for some time. A 2007 Pentagon memo that the New York Times quoted in a 2010 article says that Afghanistan could be the "Saudi Arabia of lithium." U.S. Companies are planning on taking a larger role in extracting Afghanistan's enormous reserves of valuable rare earth minerals, Reuters reported after U.S. President Donald Trump met with his Afghan counterpart Ashraf Ghani on Thursday. According to a White House statement, the presidents agreed that the development of Afghan minerals by U.S. companies would "develop materials critical to national security," as well as "defray some of the costs of United States assistance as Afghans become more self-reliant." Afghanistan has some of the world's largest un-extracted reserves of rare earth minerals valuable in electronic production, such as lithium, as well as gold and various gemstones. The U.S. Geological Survey estimates the total value at at least US$1 trillion. The two presidents reportedly discussed difficulties facing the project, such as the growing Taliban insurgency in regions containing the majority of the minerals. With this in account, they both expressed commitment to Trump's new Afghanistan strategy, which, against what he promised in the election campaign, involves keeping U.S. military forces in the country for an indefinite period of time. The U.S. military has had its eyes on Afghan mineral deposits for some time. A 2007 Pentagon memo that the New York Times quoted in a 2010 article says that Afghanistan could be the "Saudi Arabia of lithium," referencing the oil-rich monarchy that is a key U.S. regional ally. "There is stunning potential here (in Afghanistan)," General David Petraeus said in the same memo. Some analysts also believe that a push for greater U.S. presence in Afghan mineral extraction could be a way of limiting the influence of China. With China, along with Russia and Iran gaining greater regional influence, economic activities in the region are no longer the sole domain of U.S.-based companies. China and Afghanistan have already cooperated to an extent in mineral extraction and China has made the country a center-point of its planned Belt and Road initiative, which seeks to commercially link Asia, the Middle East, Africa, and more recently Latin America and the Caribbean. Afghanistan also has extensive oil reserves, with a new oil field having been discovered as recently as 2010. Written by TeleSUR Editor's Note: This natural resource extraction was one of the original ambitions of those who disingenuously led the US to war in Afghanistan under the guise of fighting a "war on terror," that better resembles a war OF terror, much like has been seen in any country the US "liberates." And in classically contradictory deep state fashion, this is being framed ironically as a way to 'defray cost of assistance.' So after Afghanistan is left in ruin, with more "terrorist" presence than to begin with, otherwise known as US "assistance," the US is now going to begin mining (more of) the country's natural resources, in exchange for that "assistance." Long ago, this country was usurped by individuals who now deceptively carry out this type of atrocity in your name, while invoking and stoking your blind patriotism at every turn. Do not be fooled. It is time to retake the America we once knew. Help Us Be The Change We Wish To See In The World.	1

This is my "You've really stepped in it" face. Chief Lester Jannings: So you're the famous Harry Callahan. So I'm going to tell you two things. We don't have any spoilers in this town and we don't need any from you. Got it? Harry Callahan: Aye-aye, sir. Callahan is getting razed by a judge due to yet another unreasonable search and seizure and the little pukes get to walk.  They snark on Callahan in the elevator and Harry sets them straight by terrifying them with size and snarl.   No sooner is he back on the streets he interrupts a robbery at his favorite diner by smoking three of the four scumbags and tells the surviving punk to make his day.  The smart lad drops his pistol and gives up.  Disrupting a stakeout of an alleged crime boss Threlkis at his granddaughter's wedding, the slime finds out he actually has a heart as it fails on him and he vapor locks.  Couldn't happen to a nicer guy in this writer's opinion and Harry agrees. Difference of opinions. Callahan's superiors are teed off at the actions of the inspector leading to this heart attack and  grumble at his methods demanding Harry takes a vacation rather than they suspend him. No sooner is Harry on vacation that four of Threlkis's men try to ambush him leading to three of them having holes inside them the size of cantaloupe and one managed to escape.  Lt. Donnelly ( Michael Currie of Dark Shadows, Soap, Halloween III: Season of the Witch, The Dead Pool and Dying Time ) gives Harry an assignment to San Paulo where a previous homicide used to live so Harry is to do some background checking and then report back.  Meanwhile in San Paulo a similiar homicide that occured in San Francisco happens.  Harry digs deeper in spite of Chief Jennings ( Pat Hingle of Invitation to a Gunfighter, Hang 'Em High, Nightmare Honeymoon, Batman and Batman Returns ) grumblings.    Harry starts to fall for an artist with a dark past, Jennifer ( Sondra Locke of The Outlaw Josey Wales, The Gauntlet, Every Which Way But Loose, Bronco Billy and Any Which Way You Can ) but the clock is ticking as the homicides keep piling up in this small town.  I think Death and Harry have an agreement or understanding. I had just some fun trivia on the movie.  This would be the eleventh movie Eastwood directed and the only Dirty Harry Movie Eastwood directed.  Furthermore, this is the first Dirty Harry film that Harry does not have a partner backing him up and still remains the highest-grossing of the Dirty Harry franchise. I use this one for bears and kids blaring their hip hop.	1
(CNN) Almost 6 in 10 Americans have a favorable opinion about Joe Biden in a new CNN national poll , a finding sure to give the Democratic former vice president a boost as he considers whether to run for president in 2020. The 57% favorable rating is Biden's best in CNN polling since February 2009 -- when he was sworn in as Barack Obama's vice president. Just over 1 in 4 (27%) have an unfavorable view of Biden. What's remarkable about those numbers is how Biden's favorability has surged since he (and Obama) left office. As recently as March 2015, CNN polling showed more people viewed Biden unfavorably (46%) than regarded him favorably (43%). The recovery of Biden's numbers stands in stark contrast to the ongoing negative view that Americans hold of Hillary Clinton, the Democratic Party's 2016 presidential nominee; in Gallup polling released earlier this week, Clinton's favorable rating dipped to 36% What explains Biden's current popularity? A few things: He drew hugely laudatory coverage earlier this year for his book tour in support of his memoir about the loss of his eldest son, Beau. Politicians -- with the notable exception of Clinton (of late) -- always grow more popular when out of office. Some level of buyer's remorse -- particularly among Democrats -- who believe that had Biden run in 2016, he would have easily beaten Donald Trump. Biden has been open about his thinking on running for president in 2020, which would be his third bid for the nation's highest office. "If I were offered the nomination by the Lord Almighty right now, today, I would say no because we're not ready, the family's not ready to do this," Biden said on "The View" earlier this month. "If, in a year from now, if we're ready, and nobody has moved in that I think can do it, then I may very well do it." JUST WATCHED Biden won't deny a 2020 run for president Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Biden won't deny a 2020 run for president 01:21 While Biden has made no decisions, he's doing the sorts of things someone running for president does in these early stages. He has apologized for his less-than-robust defense of Anita Hill during Clarence Thomas' Supreme Court confirmation hearing in 1991. He has traveled the country in support of Democratic candidates. And so on. What's so interesting about the CNN poll is that it not only shows why Biden is clearly a top-tier candidate if he runs for president but it also reveals his potential Achilles' heel in that race. When asked whether "the country would be governed better or governed worse if more women were in political office," almost two-thirds of Americans (64%) said the country would be better off with more women in office. Just 10% said things would be worse with more women in elected office, while 16% said it wouldn't make much difference. Why is that relevant to Biden? Because he is a 75-year-old white man considering a run for president amid the #metoo movement and a cultural awakening about the boorish -- and in some cases criminal -- behavior by men toward women in the workplace. That a large majority of people believe the country would be better off with more women running things suggests a major opening exists for a female politician to make a very credible run for the Democratic nomination in 2020. At the moment, none of the female candidates who might run are even close to as well known as Biden. One example: More than half of the country -- 55% -- didn't know enough about New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand to offer an opinion about her in the new CNN poll But, it's 2017. Which means Gillibrand, who has become a leading voice of the #metoo movement in Congress, has plenty of time to get better known and to challenge the likes of Biden for the nomination. That is a worry for another day for Biden and his allies, however. Today they will revel in his popularity and use those positive numbers to build buzz for a 2020 bid.	1
Tax day is almost upon us, so today we have a question about taxes and politics. Why do US presidents – and presidential aspirants – release their tax returns to the press? Yes, we know it's a sunshine thing. It's supposed to prove they're paying their fair share. But why taxes, specifically? Is the publication of presidential financial data, like so many Washington political rituals, the result of some particular scandal? Why yes it is, and thanks for asking! It lets us open the gift to journalists and historians that is the life of Richard M. Nixon. His 1974 resignation over Watergate makes it easy today to forget that by late 1973, President Nixon was in big trouble over how little he was paying in federal taxes. He himself first steered attention to his taxes by boasting at a September press conference that he'd been audited by the IRS and found clean. Reporters started digging and, long story short, he had paid Uncle Sam less than $6,000 on an aggregate income of $790,000 from 1970 through 1972. He'd taken big deductions for donating his vice-presidential papers to charity and for interest on the mortgage for his San Clemente house, among other things. The public was outraged. "Nixon's taxes were an issue that average citizens readily understood as compared to the constitutional issues raised by the Watergate investigation," concluded University of Alabama tax professor William Samson, in a 2005 analysis of the returns. Upon further consideration, the IRS decided that Nixon owed $465,000 in back taxes, which he paid. This penalty cut Nixon's personal wealth in half. After Nixon's resignation, President Gerald Ford faced the task of restoring citizens' faith in government. The US tax system is largely voluntary, after all. Few taxpayers are audited. If voters think the person at the top is cheating, they will, too. So in April 1976, at the start of his own reelection campaign, Mr. Ford publicly released his 1975 return. He'd paid $94,569 in taxes on an income of $204,606. After he was elected, Jimmy Carter followed suit, and so has every president since, as well as numerous vice presidents and other top US politicians. Tax Day 2011: Part 1: When is the tax deadline?

Two time World Pro Jiu Jitsu Champ (Kit Dale) versus a five time No Gi World Champion (Garry Tonon) proved to be a bit lopsided match skill-wise than the betting odds would have led you to believe. Let's have a look at the highlights: 19:59 remaining Tonon immediately rolls for a kneebar but is abit too far and ends up in still in a safe position pulling butterfly guard. 18:00 Remaining Tonon switches from butterfly to half guard and works to get deep. Rolls for a heel hook that starts to look nasty, Kit Dale escapes. 17:35 Remaining Dale nearly passes Toon's guard (not shown), but Tonon is able to get back to half guard. Tonon eventually backs his hips out and they are on their feet. 17:20 Remaining Tonon gets a front headlock from the feet. Dale tries to sit out which puts him in guillotine trouble. Dale tries a few different escapes but to no avail, Tonon hangs on tight and gets the sub. Result: Garry Tonon defeats Kit Dale by guillotine choke What did you think of this match?

A new teaser trailer for the Princess And The Frog is online, and while the hand-drawn animation is really exquisite, there are still several upsetting things about what's being called Disney's "first black princess" movie. Although the New Orleans Jazz Age and bayous make a gorgeous backdrop for this story, some of the elements in this (admittedly short) new trailer made me knit my brow. Of course, these snippets of scenes are taken out of context, and no one is expecting the film to be perfect. But after years and years of Euro-centric stories, this American tale should be told properly — without being offensive. Here's what's troubling: The witch doctor's "curse" seems to involve some kind of African-esque masks; because African people are spooky and scary and have magical powers! Or at least, that's what we want young, impressionable children to think. "Women like a man with a big back porch," says the firefly, slapping his ass. Cut to: The Prince's butt, growing huge, and a white lady screaming. As previously mentioned, it seems like the "princess" spends most of her time on screen not as a black girl, but as a frog. Does Mama Odie, the "good" voodoo lady and the fairy godmother-ish character, look a little Mammy-ish? I mean, she could have been tall and willowy, or hunched and crone-y, or lots of different body types. Just saying. I've said it before and I'll say it again: That toothless firefly is bothersome. Someone needs to get him some low-cost dental care, ASAP. Advertisement The good news is that the Princess seems smart, bold and fun — and the doll is sure to be a big seller at Christmastime, giving little black girls who wish upon a star a shot at believing dreams come true.

More than 70 North Carolina law enforcement agencies are using automatic license plate readers, cell phone location trackers and surveillance cameras to keep an eye, and a mass of data, on ordinary citizens. And soon, they could be able to add unmanned drones to that list.  The American Civil Liberties Union of North Carolina (ACLU-NC) uncovered a wealth of information about surveillance technologies that police and sheriff's departments use in jurisdictions across the state, through a series of public records requests. Thursday morning, ACLU-NC policy director Sarah Preston and staff attorney Nathan Wessler joined former state Senator and criminal defense attorney Thom Goolsby to host a legislative briefing on privacy and surveillance issues.  While surveillance technology is not new, its use by law enforcement is becoming more widespread in the digital age, and the laws regulating its use have fallen far behind. The federal statute that governs warrantless access to cell phone and email records, for example, has not been updated since 1986. Now, regulating surveillance technology is falling to the states, and the ACLU-NC is pushing for legislation that protects the Fourth Amendment, by requiring law enforcement to obtain a warrant before collecting certain kinds of digital information on citizens.  "Bills that have been introduced in the past have had bi-partisan support," Preston said. "This is a great issue to bring forward right now to build common ground (between parties). We are really hopeful that we will see legislators move forward and we're thankful that they are taking an interest in this."  Law enforcement agencies can track locations electronically in two ways.  First, they can request historical data from a cell phone service provider, as providers log the sector of the specific cell phone tower that transmitted every phone call made and received, every text message sent and received and every time a phone is used to access data such as email or social media sites. With more and more people using smart phones, more cell phone towers are being built closer together, making law enforcement's ability to locate someone GPS-level precise.  Though this practice is widespread—the ACL-NCU found that in 2014, AT&T received 30 thousand data requests from law enforcement, and that the numbers of requests are increasing monthly—it could easily be regulated by requiring police to obtain a warrant before receiving the data.  Police can also use their own technology to track location with the purchase of Cell Site Simulators, or Stingrays, from private manufacturers. Stingrays mimic cell phone towers by sending out signals which trick every cell phone in the vicinity into reporting its unique serial number and other data. A cell phone user would have no way to tell if police were tracking their phone.  Stingray use is shrouded in secrecy—the Associated Press reports that the Obama administration instructed police departments not to disclose their use of Stingrays— so it is unclear how much data law enforcement agencies obtain with these devices. But Stingrays can pinpoint an individual cell phone's location down to a room in a building and law enforcement can track cell phone transmissions and record their locations over time. Regulating these devices will go beyond just having to obtain a warrant, as they gather data from not just one individual cell phone, but from all the cell phones in the vicinity.  "It's vital to address both historical and real time records," said ACLU-NC staff attorney Wessler. "Historical records give police a power that in our entire history they have never had before, essentially a time machine that lets police go back in time and see where you have been in the course of days and weeks and months."  Automatic License Plate Readers (ALPR's)—cameras mounted on stoplights, buildings, police cruisers—can capture thousands of license plates per minute, scan them for red flags and store the time-stamped images indefinitely. While ALPR's have many non-controversial uses, like matching tags to stolen vehicles or capturing traffic violations, their widespread use and the data they store could allow government agencies to map out a person's location and movements over time, an invasion of privacy.  In North Carolina, the ACLU-NC found that 11 jurisdictions use ALPR's without any state regulation, and some agencies store the information for years, regardless of whether there is any suspicion of a crime. Simply requiring the images to be deleted after a period of ten days could be an effective way to regulate these devices.  Unmanned aircraft, or drones, could present a significant new avenue for government surveillance, according to the ACLU-NC. Law enforcement agencies across the country, including in North Carolina, have expressed interest in testing drones, and at least two jurisdictions in the state have purchased drones with surveillance equipment using drug forfeiture funds. The 2014 budget included HB 1066, a bill that ostensibly sought to regulate the use of drones by government agencies but that contained a long list of exceptions that allowed their use without a warrant.  The ACLU-NC is lobbying to amend state law to limit the use of drones "to instances where there are specific and artic	1
SEC Files Fraud Charges Against Former Restaurant Executives for Undisclosed Compensation and Accounting Fraud; Former CEO Agrees to Pay $500,000 Civil Penalty FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE 2006-89 Washington, D.C., June 7, 2006 - The Securities and Exchange Commission announced today the filing of securities fraud charges against three former top officers of an operator of national restaurant chains in connection with their receipt of approximately one million dollars in undisclosed compensation, participation in undisclosed related party transactions, and financial statement fraud from 2000 to 2004. The SEC charges were filed against Buca, Inc.'s former CEO, Joseph Micatrotto, the company's former CFO, Greg Gadel, and its former Controller, Daniel J. Skrypek. Buca is a Minneapolis, Minn., company that operates the Buca di Beppo and Vinny T's of Boston national restaurant chains. "Buca's top officers created a tone at the top and a corporate culture that allowed them to loot the company and engage in a financial fraud," stated Linda Thomsen, the SEC's Director of Enforcement. "Such conduct is a fundamental violation of the trust placed in corporate officers by public shareholders and cannot be countenanced." "The fraud that pervaded the executive suite at Buca existed because the company's top officers showed scant regard for sound corporate governance," said Merri Jo Gillette, Director of the Commission's Midwest Regional Office. "The sanctions obtained against Buca's former CEO, Mr. Micatrotto, demonstrate that the Commission will deal with such conduct in the strongest terms." Micatrotto has agreed to settle the Commission's action, filed in the United States District Court for the District of Minnesota, by consenting to a permanent injunction, disgorgement of $65,000 plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty of $500,000 and a bar from serving as an officer or director of a public company. In setting the disgorgement amount, the Commission took into account Micatrotto's previous payments to Buca in connection with his undisclosed compensation and his transfer of title of an Italian villa to Buca. The Commission's complaint alleges that, from 2000 to 2003, Micatrotto obtained undisclosed compensation in the amount of $849,100 by improperly billing Buca for a wide variety of personal and non-business expenses. In a separate action, filed against Buca's former CFO, Greg A. Gadel, and former Controller, Daniel J. Skrypek, the Commission alleges that Gadel and Skrypek approved many of Micatrotto's inappropriate reimbursement requests. The complaint against Micatrotto alleges that Buca "reimbursed" the former CEO for, among other things, $131,000 in cash withdrawals from ATMs; a total of $127,000 for the same airline tickets submitted for reimbursement multiple times; the entire bill for the groom's dinner at his son's wedding; and other personal expenses, including dog kenneling and the remodeling of his homes in California, Las Vegas and Minneapolis. However, since these payments were not made to reimburse legitimate business expenses, they constituted additional compensation to Micatrotto and should have been reflected as such on Buca's books. They were not. As a result, Buca's proxy statements for this time period understated Micatrotto's annual compensation by amounts ranging from 27% to 74%. The Commission's complaint further alleges that Micatrotto engaged in two undisclosed related-party transactions. First, in 2001 Micatrotto used Buca funds to purchase an Italian villa in the name of himself and his wife, and then arranged for Buca to pay for certain improvements to the villa. Second, in June 2003 Micatrotto personally received $65,000 from one of Buca's vendors. The complaint charges Micatrotto with violating, and aiding and abetting violations of, the antifraud, proxy, reporting, internal controls and books and records provisions of the federal securities laws. In its separate action against Buca's former CFO, Gadel, and former Controller, Skrypek, the Commission alleges that Gadel, from 2000 to 2003, received approximately $96,630 in undisclosed compensation, including reimbursements that he obtained from Buca for family vacations and visits to strip clubs. The complaint further alleges that Gadel knew of a series of undisclosed related party transactions totaling more than $1 million between Buca and an information technology company of which Gadel was a director and shareholder. Finally, the Commission's complaint alleges that Gadel and Skrypek directed a financial fraud in which Buca inflated its income by nearly $12 million from 2000 to 2004 through the improper capitalization of numerous expenses. The financial fraud caused Buca to overstate its annual income in amounts ranging from 18.8% to 36.9%. The Commission's complaint was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Minnesota	1
Hidden is theft tracking software for Mac OS X that works to help you recover your stolen MacBook Pro (or MacBook Air, MacBook, and any other Mac OS X machine really). It works by laying dormant on your Mac until you visit the Hidden website and mark your computer as stolen, this then activates the tracking software. Once activated, Hidden starts gathering a slew of information on your missing Mac, including location plotted on Google Maps (see screenshot above), photos of the thief via the built-in iSight camera, screenshots of your Mac in use and what the thief is doing, IP addresses, and more. After you can install the app, you can test out its efficacy yourself by using 'Test Mode' through their web control panel, this will give you an idea of the data collected and how the app works. Hidden reportedly works across the globe, so whether you're in San Francisco or Budapest you'll be able to get use out of the app. To get the most out of Hidden, the developers recommend setting up and enabling a separate password free Guest account. While this is contrary to the usual Mac security recommendations, it makes sense here, because with Hidden running you actually want the thief to be using the computer so that you can gather information about them. With all this data captured, you can turn it over to local authorities to pursue the thief. Now here's the best part, Hidden is free to download and install until January, after which the price is a low $20. Update: Apparently Hidden is no longer free, the developer was swarmed with requests and had to cancel the offer. If you are looking for a free anti-theft solution, try PreyProject. Get Hidden for Mac OS X here for $20 Check out the video below to see how the app installs, works, and what it tracks:  If you have a MacBook, MacBook Pro, MacBook Air, or even a desktop Mac and you're at all concerned about theft, you should grab this software. Free is an amazing price for what may help you recover a stolen Mac some day, and hey even if you miss out on the free deal, $20 is a small price to pay if it means the difference between finding a stolen Mac or having to buy a new one. Thanks to LifeHacker for finding this one!	1

Is Binance Finally Starting to Run Low on Walton? How Demand for Guardian Masternodes is Affecting Binance's Token Supply This post builds upon the ideas raised by Mr. Laserman's great article Guardian Masternode Token Lockup, so you may want to read that article first. If you don't want to read a lot, but like data, you can get the basic narrative from this spreadsheet: Transactions on Binance's Walton Wallet. You can watch the Binance Walton wallet balance here. BACKGROUND On November 27 Walton announced their Guardian Masternode program. (Guardian Masternode AMA) Anyone with 5000+ Walton tokens in their wallet before 7:00 PM EST on Saturday, December 9 can run a Guardian Masternode. (Countdown timer) can run a Guardian Masternode. (Countdown timer) No additional Guardian Masternodes will ever be created after this deadline. Guardian Masternodes will receive higher mining rewards than standard masternodes. WATCHING THE BINANCE WALLET Mr. Laserman's Helpful Analysis On November 30, Mr. L posted his article "Guardian Masternode token lockup," showing why the introduction of Guardian Masternodes would cause a rapid reduction in the number of tokens available for purchase, and thereforce likely cause a price increase. Because Binance is the only major exchange that currently trades Walton, Mr. Lasermen pointed out that Binance represents "96% of all tokens kept on exchanges," and showed the effect that the announcement had already on Binance's supply of Walton tokens: November 27th: One hour before the Guardian Masternode was announced, Binance had 3,760,193 WTC (15% of the circulating supply) in its wallet. November 30th: Binance had only 2,013,874 WTC (8% of the circulating supply) in its wallet. 44% of all liquid tradable WTC have been removed from the marketplace in 3 days. Mr. L then speculated that if 50% of Binance's remaining Walton tokens were withdrawn during the run-up to the Guardian deadline, that would leave only 1 million tokens for sale on Binance, or about 4% of the circulating supply. This drastic reduction in available supply would then affect the price accordingly: If demand remains constant, I would expect a 200–300% increase in price over the next 30 days as the market tries to find a new equilibrium. This would translate to a price in the range of $10.34 to $15.51. If demand increases, I would expect a 400% increase in price at a minimum. The upper bounds are impossible to predict if a FOMO event takes place. However, 1000% is entirely possible in that scenario. This would translate to a price in the range from $20.68 to $51.70. How Things Have Played Out Since Then As it turns out, despite his great insights, Mr. L drastically underestimated the rate at which Walton would be withdrawn from Binance. On November 30, around 5:30 pm EST, he speculated that perhaps about 1 million WTC would be withdrawn over the next 10 days leading up to the deadline. In fact, 1 million WTC had already been withdrawn from Binance by 8:30 pm the next day, just 27 hours later. Plot Twist But what Mr. Laserman didn't count on was that Binance was going to "re-up" their Walton wallet, using customer deposits from other wallet addresses. On December 1 at 5:00 am, Binance added another 1.2 million in WTC to their wallet address, bringing the balance up to 2.6 million. And again, on December 2, Binance deposited an additional 1.1 million WTC to their wallet. On this spreadsheet you can see all of deposits and withdrawals on Binance's wallet address for Walton. STUDYING THE RE-UPS So, what can we learn about Binance's token supply based on their patterns of refilling their Walton wallet? Here are the re-ups before the Guardian Node Announcement: August 25 — Wallet is created. First deposit batch adds 1.3 million WTC. September 4 — Wallet balance dwindles to 500k WTC. Binance adds 9 million WTC to the wallet. September 11—Binance adds another 7.4 million to the wallet, bringing the wallet to it's highest balance so far, 14.1 million. And here are the re-ups since the Walton Guardian Node Announcement on November 27. December 1 — Binance deposits 1.2 million. Resulting balance = 2.6 million WTC December 2 — Binance deposits 1.1 million. Resulting balance = 2.8 million	1
English [ edit ] Alternative forms [ edit ] Etymology [ edit ] The Oxford English Dictionary has this as a native English word, first appearing in print in 1762 (Smollett). The OED and other etymologists do not consider the possibility that the word was introduced from India into the English language. The term 'Hullabol' is still used in Indian English to describe a type of public demonstration, involving making a great noise. 'Hulla' is either derived from 'Hamla' meaning 'attack' or from 'halhala' meaning 'ululation' (both words from Persian and then Urdu). 'Bol' is from the Hindi verb 'bolna', 'to utter or say'. Pronunciation [ edit ] Noun [ edit ] hullabaloo (plural hullabaloos) An uproar or fuss. They made such a hullabaloo about the change that the authorities were forced to change it back. 1902 — Joseph Conrad, Heart of Darkness Certainly they had brought with them some rotten hippo–meat, which couldn't have lasted very long, anyway, even if the pilgrims hadn't, in the midst of a shocking hullabaloo, thrown a considerable quantity of it overboard.

Originally Posted by TheLionLegend Originally Posted by Right now, at its first stage, the new card system is amateur.  Hirez tried to make players happy by giving them a purpose in the game; level up cards! People have been asking for a form of grinding and Hirez acted based on the feedback people gave in the forums. (no more champs, no more skins, please fix bugs, please add new features, please add a purpose).  What Hirez didn't realize is that the millions of players that already play Paladins, don't play this game because of its grinding (which does not exist); they play this game because of its unique strategy which combines a balanced diversity of different play-styles (champions) the player can choose from... either to support the overall strategy of his team (comp/pro scene) or to kill as many enemies as possible with that strategy and enjoy it(casual).  Now because Hirez didn't realize that, they disturbed that so unique game balance, the balance between those completely different play-styles (champions), the diversity of equally strong yet extremely different styles that makes Paladins stand out of the crowd in the world of gaming!...  They allowed players with non-equal (up to 400% stronger) loadouts to face each other in every game mode of Paladins, except Competitive!  No! Balancing Competitive is not all that matters! Casual has always been a critical success factor for Paladins! Much more people played Casual than Competitive... I agree that Competitive needs a boost to become a bit more popular but ruining the rest of the game modes isn't the way to go for it!  It is true that the Pro Scene have been advertised a lot lately and literally formed the meta, the trends, the play-styles for both Competitive and Casual. I don't say everyone used those play-styles (especially in low ELO) but the need to catch the opponents off-guard using new strategies in Pro Scene generated a lot of new strategie which kept the game alive and going!  It wasn't the new skins coming out that kept the game alive all this time, but the new strategies developed by the Pros and advertised by the YouTubers!  The disadvantage of this mechanism (although it worked pretty well) is that it only affects more experienced players who spend time to study and test these new strategies. The newest players aren't affected directly and the only thing that keeps them playing is their curiosity to try out all the champions and make them work somehow... maybe try all the legendary as well. After that stage (around level 30-40, idk for sure) and before they enter the stage we mentioned above (where they can test the most of those advanced, team based strategies suggested by Pros) there is a gap where many players might find Paladins boring and give up on it.  There is where the new card system is useful! It gives a purpose to those players; max out their cards to enjoy an over-powered experience in Casual (e.g. infinite roll cassie, infinite ammo vivian, super mobility maeve, godlike counter zhin, super tank inara, healing god mal'damba etc.)!  This is how the new casual should be advertised; a mode without pressure, where you can experience the ultimate versions of your champions and play around in a variety of maps and modes!  The ONLY way this dream can become reality is to make the process of maxing out cards relatively easy! Every player that is experienced enough to ''spontaneously form a battle plan, play as a team and adjust his/her playstyle to according to the situation'' or else reach around level 80, should have the majority of his/her cards maxed out!  While grinding might seem exciting for a new player, for an experienced player it will be frustrating and confusing.  Jumping from a fair battlefield (like Competitive) to an unfair battlefield (like Casual) will have the following circumstances: A) Confusion (like playing a whole different game). B) Need to adjust strategy based on the team's card levels (more thinking, less casualty). C) Limitation of viable strategies (due to low level cards). D) The player can't trust on his/her own skill and the instincts he/she has developed in Competitive.  The level at which an experienced player is playing, demands a fair battlefield even in Casual settings. Why? Because even the smallest interaction counts. Because the way that player use his/her game understanding to succeed is spontaneous and based on those interactions.  That's why the grinding should stop after a certain level and every match should be fair (even in casual).  A quick calculation on how many cards	1

The Los Angeles Police Department incorrectly reported 14,000 assaults as minor offenses between 2005 and 2012, according to a new report, making the city's crime rate look significantly lower than it really is. The Los Angeles Times analyzed eight years of LAPD crime data and found that aggravated assaults had been routinely classified as "simple assaults" and therefore weren't counted in the city's numbers tallying violent crime. L.A.P.D officials acknowledged the botched reporting and said they were working to make the department's reporting more reliable. "We know this can have a corrosive effect on the public's trust of our reporting," Asst. Chief Michel Moore, who oversees the LAPD's system for tracking crime, told the newspaper. "That's why we are committed to … eliminating as much of the error as possible." Reclassifying the incidents increases the number of violent crimes in L.A. by 7% and makes the number of serious assaults 16% higher than originally reported, according to the Times. The reclassified numbers, however, do not affect the overall downward trend in crime throughout the city. The Times launched a similar investigation last year involving 2013 crime statistics and found similar errors. An internal LAPD audit released last week found that serious assaults in 2014 had also been misclassified. The review found that the number of aggravated assaults was 23% higher in 2014 than previously reported. [L.A. Times]	1
"I have immediately summoned the US ambassador and he will be received this morning at the Quai d'Orsay (the French Foreign Ministry)," Fabius told reporters on the sidelines of an EU meeting in Luxembourg on Monday. NSA secretly recorded millions of phone calls made in France, French daily "Le Monde" reported on Monday, citing documents leaked by former NSA intelligence contractor Edward Snowden, who has taken temporary refuge in Russia. The allegations risked turning into a diplomatic row just as US Secretary of State John Kerry arrived in Paris for the start of a European tour over Syria. Earlier, France's interior minister, Manuel Valls, said Le Monde's revelations that 70.3 million pieces of French telephone data were recorded by the NSA between Dec 10, 2012 and Jan 8, 2013 were "shocking." "If an allied country spies on France or spies on other European countries, that's totally unacceptable," Valls told. US Ambassador to France Charles Rivkin declined immediate comment on reports that he had been called in by the French foreign ministry but stressed that US-French ties were close. "This relationship on a military, intelligence, special forces ... level is the best it's been in a generation," Rivkin told. In July, Paris prosecutors opened preliminary inquiries into the NSA's programme, known as Prism, after Germany's Der Spiegel and Britain's The Guardian revealed wide-scale spying by the agency leaked by Edward Snowden. "We were warned in June (about the programme) and we reacted strongly but obviously we need to go further," Fabius said. "We must quickly assure that these practices aren't repeated." RA/NJF	1
We're incredibly grateful for the support that all of you have shown over the past few weeks, and now we're in the home stretch of the Kickstarter campaign with just four days left. PS4/Vita Releases in the Works We've been talking to people at Sony for quite a while now, and we're finally at a point where we can say: we're working towards PS4 and PS Vita releases of Drift Stage, and the fact that we've exceeded our funding goal is certainly going to help make it happen. We're still focused on PC/Mac/Linux right now, but we're hoping to hit PS4/Vita in 2016. If you're a fan of other non-Sony affiliated game devices, we haven't ruled them out, but we don't have anything to say right now. Press Highlights We've gotten a lot of great press coverage over the course of the Kickstarter, and we're super flattered by all of it. Here's a few recent highlights: Track Creator If you don't follow us on Twitter, you probably should, but also you may have missed some glimpses of our work-in-progress track creator.

We've got our fingers crossed that this one manages to deliver an experience on par with its art. Thanks, Again We've still got a long road ahead, but we're glad to already have some amazing people supporting us. Thanks!	1
There are still a lot of elbows being thrown in the squabble about "creation" versus "curation," and it seems to be getting worse. As humans tend to do, we're talking past each other and pretending to simplicity in the face of the complex and the weird. Here's what I think is going on. I think we're getting tripped up by two things: clumsy language and a misapprehension about competition for limited resources. Springtime for Snipefest Earlier this spring, two well-known bloggers—Maria Popova of Brainpickings and Tina Roth-Eisenberg of Swissmiss—introduced the Curator's Code, a proposed convention for attributing credit to bloggers and other link-finders. The initial discussion that followed mostly skipped over rational critique and went straight for sneering and overheated bluster: it was, apparently, intolerable cheek for these "self-proclaimed curators" to want their efforts as digital gravediggers to be recognized when others passed their work along. (Interestingly, comments from journalists whose work is likely to be actually "curated" by bloggers, like The Atlantic' s Megan Garber and the NYT' s David Carr, were far more measured than those that sprang from the jumpy heart of the web design world.) It was all a bit discouraging, but also seemed to be over by mid-April. Alas, it seems not. Last Friday, Jonathan Harris—a sweet internet hippie who makes lovely things—had a quote from a talk tweeted out of context, as tweets from talks inevitably are: "Curation is replacing creation as a mode of self-expression." – Jonathan Harris @jjhnumber27 #creativemornings — Tina Roth Eisenberg (@swissmiss) June 1, 2012 And that sent The Awl 's Choire Sicha—who is not a hippie—into a snarkfest about faux-curators and their cultural climbing. (For the record, Harris was apparently suggesting that this "replacement" of creation by curation was something he wanted to combat, not to celebrate.) "Curation" Is Still a Stupid Term "Curation" strikes a lot of people as a weird, inaccurate thing to call the selection/connection/display activities made possible by the internet. (I wrote a gigantic thing about that awhile back—tl;dr is that we're stuck with the term, and that maybe we should work toward the traditional senses of curation by becoming better caretakers of the content we "curate.") It's probably so difficult to find a word for the practice because it's quite difficult to isolate the underlying impulse from just…being human. This stuff we do on Pinterest and Pinboard and Polyvore and (some) blogs is much less like "editing" or "curating" and much more like the casual forms of taste display that we participate in when we get dressed in the morning, create mix tapes, collect art, buy and arrange furniture, collect books or records, and banter with clerks in one of the world's three remaining video shops. The hilarious thing about the "know your place and respect your elders" screeds—there are many, and I'm not going to link to them—besides the fact that they make those of us who write them sound ancient, is that they don't even read to the people doing the "curation." Serial pinners aren't fighting for cultural credibility by using terms like "curation." They just need a term. Popova herself doesn't like the word. If I were more awesome, I'd go back in time and suggest an alternate word like "blogger" that is just palatable enough to come into mainstream use. But I'm stuck here like everyone else, so I'm going to just tell you that in my own house, and in conversations with my friends, I don't say "curator" without hand-flapping airquotes. I say "bowerbird." Birds Not Blogs If you haven't seen David Attenborough's glorious series The Life of Birds, you're missing out on something really wonderful. In one segment, he introduces the Australian bowerbird, which is notable for the extraordinary display of found materials it creates in order to seduce a mate. So for now, I'm going to just say "bowerbirds" instead of "content curators" so that I can talk about the practice instead of the title. (I'm not suggesting that everyone switch to this term—y'all can fight about the language somewhere else.) When taste-display happened only offline, it didn't really threaten anyone—except the geniuses at the RIAA, who think mixtapes are deadly and would happily sneak charge you royalties on earworms if they possibly could. Online, it's different. For one thing,	1

Top of the list of places to stay, the only 7-Star hotel in the world, Dubai's Burj Al Arab, is possibly the most luxurious hotel on the face of the planet. It should be, too, considering the $1,500 starting price for a double room. If you are lucky enough to be able to count yourself amongst the few people that can afford to frequent the place though, you'll be greeted with your very own iPad to use during your stay. Not just any iPad though. Oh no. These iPads are 24-carat gold plated – all 202 of them, and are designed exclusively for Burj Al Arab with engraved logo of the hotel. Don't get too used to it though, because you'll have to hand it back when you leave! Not content with having an iMac in every room, the hotel has now branched out to offering an iPad to each visitor throughout their stay, with a virtual concierge service as well as menus for the hotel's restaurants being housed on Apple's little tablet of wonder. House keeping and butler services are also handled by the slate, somehow managing to make even the most mundane of things interesting! If you really do want to take a golden iPad home with you, they're apparently available to purchase via the hotel although we shudder to think how much that will set you back. There's no word on which model of iPad is used, either, but we would expect it to be the latest and greatest model given the standard of the establishment. Obviously the iPads aren't the end of the luxury at the Burj Al Arab. Walk-in showers and Jacuzzis, huge plasma TVs, Rolls-Royce and a private butler service are all part of the package during your stay, though having never been to somewhere like this ourselves, that may well be standard fare! The fact that the IT people at the hotel went with Apple's iPad rather than one of the numerous competitors may be of interest to some, though we suspect it's more a case of sticking with the Apple theme than some more deep rooted hatred of Android! Regardless, we're sure it'll make a story somewhere. We'd just be happy to stay at the Burj Al Arab, iPad or no iPad!

Posted 21 January 2015 - 12:43 AM I installed mine yesterday and it seems to shoot visibly harder than my OMW Alpha Trooper and Rampage. I'll be running the Immortal Longstrike through its paces in a few weeks at the Bowling Green HvZ Winter Invitational, but until then, I'll spend time making it functionally a better blaster for HvZ purposes.  Did yours not come with catch springs either?  w/ barrel extension without barrel extension Nope Mine did not come with the catch springs. I've already emailed OMW along with a few other issuesSo I finished the install with the 7kg srping, well let's start off with the Pros-direct install, no modding neededCons-7kg spring priming gets tiring after 80+ rounds of constant firingBefore picAfter PicI was able to run some shots off the chrony but before the results I ran into some quality issues with the kitAs stated above mine also did not come with the catch springs. In addition dart fit on the breech was looser than what I am accustomed to from OMW. During test fit some of the darts fell out. I cant use my Xplorer darts because of the fit or any other dart where the diameter is smaller than a stock elite. Stefans, forget it, the performance was horrible (glue tip, xtip, stock tip, back rod, cut down nerf, xplorer). Last but not least the plunger tube was not molded well. For whatever reason mine had some casting or something leftover. I had to do my best in sanding it down without compromising the tube. I will check the o-ring after a few more rounds to see if it is tearing it up. Here are the picsPlunger tube out of the packagePlunger tube afterwardsOn with the Chrony numbers (10 shots, with new elites)92.1195.8890.9290.8892.5389.7698.69100.790.05125.10 (anamoly..)99.82102.5107.3105.4105.4102.0103.1109.9109.9103.6So all in all, the kit is definitely better than the massacre kit. Good performance and can probably get better with some more tweaks and even a brass breech or angel breech. Priming with my xplorer grip was tiring so not sure that will work well in a war. My stage 3 OMW retaliator easily outperforms this kit. But it's a nice drop in kit and this is what the longstrike really needed and should have been from the beginning.Should you buy it? That's a decision left for you decide. I like the kit.	1
While Christian Pulisic was offering compelling and historic evidence in Dortmund that he's more than ready to start on the right in this month's vital World Cup qualifiers, his national team coach, Bruce Arena, said Wednesday that he's ready to see another Bundesliga star anchor the U.S. left. It's been an issue that's followed Fabian Johnson since he became a U.S. regular in 2012. He's dangerous and dynamic going forward and has spent much of his career as a wide midfielder, first for TSG Hoffenheim and now for Borussia Mönchengladbach. But he's an effective outside back as well, and it's there that the USA's need has been greatest. Johnson started at right back during the 2014 World Cup and then once DaMarcus Beasley stepped aside (temporarily), the Munich native spent more time on the left. Former U.S. coach Jurgen Klinsmann experimented in an effort to get Johnson higher up the field but never found a solution. Johnson was in back at the 2015 Gold Cup and 2016 Copa América Centenario and made only his second and third midfield starts of '16 in Klinsmann's final two games. Sporting Kansas City center back Matt Besler was out on the left as the USA fell to Mexico and Costa Rica. Speaking during a Facebook chat on Wednesday, Arena indicated that he's ready to see if he can steer Johnson toward becoming regular international midfielder. "He plays almost on a regular basis as a left-sided midfielder at Mönchengladbach and if we can, we want to play Fabian in the midfield," Arena said. "So that's obviously one of our goals in 2017, is to find a position for him and allow him to play it on a consistent basis." Arena wasn't ready to make a full commitment, however, because spots in back remain unsettled. And with the Honduras (March 24) and Panama (March 28) games coming up, and with at least four points a virtual necessity, Arena may have to keep the tweaking to a minimum this month. "I wish I could give you the answer right now," he said when asked who was the current first-choice left back. "All kinds of possibilities exist—from Fabian Johnson, who I indicated our preference is to have him in the midfield. Jorge Villafaña and Greg Garza had good showings in January and February with us in camp. Also DaMarcus Beasley showed well in his first game with Houston over the past weekend, so those are all four candidates." Arena went on to mention Tim Ream, Besler and Eric Lichaj as dark-horse options. "We're hopeful that we're going to arrive at the right plan," the manager said. Arena reiterated that he's considering a pool of around 40 players and plans to name a team of 23-25 on March 15. The squad won't gather in San Jose until the 20th, leaving Arena and his staff with the option to make a change or two based on form, injury and what happens that final weekend. They face an interesting challenge. The players with whom Arena is most familiar are in MLS. He coached against them while with the LA Galaxy and spent a month working with them at the recent U.S. camp. But the players who are the fittest and most in-form are in Europe and Mexico. The only interaction Arena has had with them has been from the stands or over the phone. The four days of training leading up to the Honduras game will be vital, as Arena told reporters earlier this week that his foreign-based charges have an edge. "The players abroad are certainly match fit and a little bit sharper," he said. "You could see the MLS games this weekend. The teams aren't fit yet—not a whole lot of combination play. They're just starting. It takes time. That's what the Premiership looks like in August as well. It's no different. I think all things being equal, I would think we would lean towards a player who has been playing on a regular basis or training on a regular basis." He added Wednesday, "For the most part I was fairly pleased [with the MLS openers]. This weekend is going to be very important for the MLS players as we make our final decisions." Arena said he likely would be in Kansas City this weekend as Sporting KC hosts FC Dallas. Here are a few more highlights from Arena's chat on Wednesday: — Regarding the goalkeepers, he said Real Salt Lake's Nick Rimando emerged from January camp with "a little bit of an edge" over his domestic competition. Tim Howard has been out since suffering a groin injury against Mexico and wasn't on the active roster when the Colorado Rapids began their season last weekend. "We're waiting to see whether he plays for Colorado this weekend," Arena said. "If	1
Ask any startup veteran: Mistakes are made. No matter how successful a company ultimately becomes, you can be sure that its early days were peppered with missteps and failures—most minor, but a few likely painful and spectacular. So, why would anyone want to share those mistakes with the world? That's the question of the day for Lauren Kay and Emma Tessler, co-founders of Dating Ring, an online matchmaking service. The company is the subject of season two of the podcast Startup, which premieres on Thursday. Startup devotes each season to chronicling the ups and downs of a single fledgling company. The first season followed the show's creator, Alex Blumberg, as he attempted to launch his own podcasting company. As far as podcasts go, Blumberg is something of a superstar, with successful runs at both This American Life and NPR's Planet Money. That didn't stop him from going off the rails during the show, though. Listeners heard Blumberg stutter through disastrous VC pitches and agonize over whether he was taking the company in the right direction. The tape caught dozens of fraught exchanges between Blumberg and his wife, his partner, his investors and several of his overworked employees. Kay and Tessler say they expect Dating Ring to get the same warts-and-all treatment. (They are continuing to tape through June and will not hear any of the episodes before they air.) Fundraising—"or trying to"—will be a major theme of the season, says Kay. The company has raised only $355,000 so far, so listeners will also hear frank discussion of how long the founders can continue without an infusion of cash. What else will we hear this season? A partner leaves the company unexpectedly, say Kay and Tessler. The pair will also discuss the details of their experience at Y Combinator; Dating Ring was part of the incubator's class of January 2014. They say the Startup staff has interviewed a number of people, including Y Combinator partners and the head of competitor Match.com. And of course, Kay and Tessler don't know what was said in these interviews. "Maybe it will be cool," says Kay. "Or maybe it will be more like middle school, when people would talk about you behind your back." The pair say that, while they're "terrified" of what the podcast may expose about the company (or the founders themselves), they didn't hesitate to sign on when they were selected by the Startup producers. They hope the publicity will boost their user numbers (Dating Ring currently has 3,000 or so active members, about 15% of whom pay the $240 fee for a three-month membership ) and push the company achieve profitability. "We're really hoping that being on Startup will be the push we need," says Kay. This isn't the company's first time in the media spotlight. Last year, Kay noticed a striking imbalance in the Dating Ring membership: In New York City, they had far more female clients, while their San Francisco database was dominated by men. So, the company cooked up a stunt: Cross-Country Love, a crowdfunded event where the company flew 16 single female New Yorkers out to the west coast for a long weekend of dates with Silicon Valley bachelors. Not surprisingly, the trip got a lot of press—not all of it positive. Valleywag memorably compared the participants to "comfort women," the women forced into sex slavery in World War II. While much of the coverage was biting, Kay says she still sees the Cross-Country Love trip as a success. "It was huge for us, it put us on the map," she says, adding that in the wake of the publicity, Dating Ring's user base doubled in size. "It's totally nerve-wracking to put your professional and personal life out there," says Tessler. "But everything is fair game." The founders say were willing to answer almost any question Startup producers threw their way. Because their startup is a dating company, they say they talked a lot about their dating and sex lives, though Tessler asked that the podcast skip the questions about her boyfriend's sex life. "That's the only place I drew the line," she says. "Occasionally I didn't record certain things," says Kay. "There were a lot of difficult moments when I was really upset." On the other hand, she says the recordings also captured some great moments. "I had a very emotional conversation with my mom, where she said some of the nicest things she's ever said," says Kay. "Now I'll always have that." Fortune plans to follow up with Kay and Tessler once the season is underway. That, says Kay, sounds great, provided "we are able to show our faces in the media again."

I just read this comment in another diary. "The analogy I have with Bernie is if you invite someone into your home and then they take over and trying to run YOU out of your own house." Yes. This is exactly what it's like. And that's what bothers me so much about Bernie right now. To me, Bernie is the guy who never got married because he couldn't commit but then turned 40 and realized he was all alone, but instead of finding someone to start a family with, he pursues a married woman. A woman who has been married for just over 20 years and the youngest kid is just about on their way to start college. She and her husband have their problems, but they love each other and they are learning to focus on each other again after raising a family together. But it's hard. They were married young, because she got pregnant. They struggled a lot early on, because they were poor. But after a lot of sacrifices and a lot of fights they figured out how to make it work and pull ahead and now that their kids are moving out they finally have another chance to have a life together. But there is a lot of work to be done to rebuild their relationship. There is a lot of hurt to heal. It's really hard for both of them, but they love each other and they want to be together. It was really scary for a while there, but if they don't give up on each other, they are going to make it. That's the Democratic party to me. Is it perfect? No. Has it fucked up? Yes. But it's also a wonderful party that has done incredible things including electing the first black President and after a lot of ups and downs it's really finally feeling like it's on it's way to being a truly great party again. And just as that is happening, along comes Bernie. He knows how to push all of the buttons pointing out all of the imperfections and fuck ups and pain and he promises a wonderful future and there is no history with him of struggling and fighting and your kids have really seem to like him and it is so tempting to just walk away from a painful difficult history and start over with someone new. There was a reply to that comment I quoted above. Yes, party loyalty should come before anything else. When I read that I felt sick to my stomach. Loyalty being talked about as if it were a weakness instead of a strength. I have liked Bernie for years. Since around 2007/8. But I have never liked that he is running for the nomination of our party. It didn't seem right to me, since he's been an independent for 40 years. But I have really not liked how he has treated this party as he has run. Throwing everyone under the bus who stands in his way. My wife and I have been married for over 15 years. In the first few years, we moved to a big city for me to get a programming job and for her to go to college. I didn't get one right away, so, we both ended up getting shift manager jobs at a video store chain. It was a hard time for us, because we were very poor and in a new city all alone and we ended up working opposite shifts from each other, so, we bare saw each other for months. My wife and I had pretty different approaches to running shifts. She was by the book and I was more relaxed. She got everything done on time. I made the store a lot of money by making friends with all the customers. My boss quit and for a while her boss ran my store as well. He was a pretty good looking guy who flirted with the girls who worked at the store a lot. He didn't particularly care for my style, but my shifts made more money than any other store in the city and he was stretched pretty thin, so, he just let it go. At least with me. With my wife he started talking shit about me. He had already tried flirting with her and it hadn't really worked out for him. He was the kind of guy who didn't take that as a hint. He took it as a challenge. He just tried harder and part of how he tried was to try to put a wedge between her and I. He actually pressed her for why she was with me. I didn't know this was happening at the time, because… well, because she didn't want me to walk into the store and knock him the fuck out… but she told me months later when I left. I have never hated anyone in my life, but I came pretty close with that guy. He wanted something, so he fucked with my marriage to try to get it. I didn't really have anything to worry about, because my wife loves me. But I still felt violated. For her, for having to endure that from her boss. But also	1

Neko Atsume, the greatest game in the history of mankind, hasn't been getting a ton of attention in the figure world. Which is, like, basically a crime against humanity.

When Sansa flees from King's Landing, her boat is intercepted at Dragonstone and she is made ward of the lately-widowed King Stannis, who refuses to listen to his bannermen's pleas that he wed the key to the North. Luckily for them, and for the prospective bride and bridegroom, Melisandre is of a similar mind, and has some tricks up her sleeve to help smooth the way... This is madness, a voice inside of him says, as the girl, as Lady Sansa, rides his lap, as she clutches a small hand at the back of his neck and bends her face to meet his, panting her wine-soured breath into his open mouth, biting her lip on moans, as he holds onto her hips, fingers tight enough to bruise, as he groans in a manner utterly unlike himself, as he bucks his hips up and captures her mouth in a sordid kiss wet with tongues—	1

From the outside at least, the actress Mo'Nique and her husband of 11 years, Sidney Hicks, would seem to be in the middle of a rocky marriage. Both have had sexual relationships with other partners for years — and continue to do so. And each is well aware of the other's escapades. But, the couple insist, the relationship is actually quite stable and they are quite happy. In fact, it has been a decade since Mo'Nique revealed in an Essence magazine article that she and Mr. Hicks, an actor and producer, were in an open marriage. Now they have begun a podcast that plays on their unusual partnership. In "Mo'Nique and Sidney's Open Relationship," which is on Play.It, the CBS podcast network, the couple explains how the so-called polyamorous lifestyle works for them. The open-marriage concept has been around for a long time, but some marital experts (though not all) say that couples interested in reaching a golden anniversary, or maybe even a first one, should be wary of following the example of Mo'Nique and Mr. Hicks, who are both 48.	1

WASHINGTON — The United States on Thursday tentatively welcomed possible Turkish-Russian cooperation against jihadists in Syria, as Ankara has proposed to Moscow, even if those countries support opposing camps there. "We remain in close contact with our Turkish allies and our partners in the fight against Daesh," State Department spokeswoman Elizabeth Trudeau said, using another name for the Islamic State group. Working against the jihadist group "is a priority for all of us," she said. "If this is truly a step in that direction, we would welcome that." Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Free Sign Up Pressed by reporters to confirm the US reaction, Trudeau said, "We've been very clear that if Russia is interested in fighting against (the IS group)," then "we would welcome that." How that cooperation would work is unclear. Moscow is allied with President Bashar al-Assad of Syria, while Ankara has supported rebel groups seeking his overthrow in a bloody civil war. But Russian-Turkish relations have warmed amid pique in Ankara that Washington and other Western capitals did not seem more supportive after the attempted military coup against President Recep Tayyip Erdogan last month. Erdogan traveled to Moscow on Tuesday to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin. On Thursday, Turkish officials representing the army, intelligence agencies and the foreign ministry were in Russia for talks on Syria, according to Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu. US Secretary of State John Kerry met with Putin last month to discuss coordinating the two countries' air strikes against IS militants and their allies. Also Thursday, the United States expressed concern about mounting reports of alleged use of chemical weapons against civilians in Syria, including during an attack in Aleppo a day earlier. Washington is "very concerned about the increasing number of allegations of chemical weapons use over the last few weeks," Trudeau said. The United States and Russia are responsible for overseeing a UN resolution from late 2013 to dismantle the Syrian government's chemical weapons arsenal. Confirmation that Assad's regime has used such weapons since then would constitute a "violation" of the resolution, Trudeau said.	1
words - min read 5 True All-American Handguns Made In USA Whether it's an overall good thing or not – we live in a globalized economy. Almost nothing is made 100% in the United States anymore. But what about firearms? As one of the few countries that affords its citizens the right to bear arms, you'd think more firearms manufacturers would be exclusively based out of here. Well, turns out that's not always the case. If you follow the supply chain long enough, you're going to find a part of a product made outside of the United States. But if you're adamant about keeping your hard earned money inside the country and supporting good craftsmanship, we'll discuss a few firearms manufacturers that mostly stay within the United States. Ruger Ruger and Smith & Wesson are almost tied in terms of firearms production and sales in the United States. Ruger, however, tries to keep much of their manufacturing process located right in the United States. Smith & Wesson – especially for the M&P Shield line of pistols – stayed within the United States. Both are considered the leaders in United States firearms manufacturing. The quality of their arms is well recognized throughout. A few notable pistols from Ruger: Ruger SR9c – The SR9c is a compact pistol with full-size capabilities. A magazine capacity of 17 rounds and plenty of accolades on function – it's an affordable choice for compact concealed carry. Ruger Sr9c Holster Ruger Sr9c Holster Ruger LCP – This is one of their flagship pistols designed especially to be affordable, reliable, and very concealable. Ruger LCP Holster Kimber Kimber quickly rose to fame with their heavily customized 1911 variants. Hailed as champions of match-grade quality 1911s as well as compact carry versions, Kimber can easily be said to be a company that has focused heavily on craftsmanship over quantity. And it shows – both in the price tag as well as the function. But, they keep it local and do the vast majority of their manufacturing within the United States. Notable Kimber pistols: Kimber 1911 Compact – A slightly more compact 1911, it's for those who want a shorter form factor without sacrificing full-size capability. Kimber 1911 Compact Holster Kimber 1911 Compact Holster Kimber 1911 Pro Model – How much better does it get in the world of 1911s? Not only does Kimber make a beautifully designed full-size professional grade 1911, it works surprisingly well as an everyday concealed carry choice. Kimber Pro Holster Kimber Pro Holster Kimber Solo – Kimber decided to dip its feet into the waters of the sub-compact concealed carry community with the Kimber Solo. Despite some complaints on its function, it's overall proven itself to be durable and easily hidden in an IWB holster. Kimber Solo Holster Kel-Tec A lot of people like to rag on Kel-Tec because their pistols and rifles don't look as sleek and attractive as Kimber or Ruger. If you subtract the aesthetics, you wind up with a fantastic, cheap, and All-American made series of concealed carry pistols. This company has prided itself on staying within the United States despite the easy reduction in manufacturing cost of going overseas. And you know what? They produce excellent concealed carry pistols. Notable concealed carry pistols: P-3AT – This concealed carry pistol, chambered in .380 ACP, has proven itself to be a reliable choice for concealed carriers. It is classified as a sub-compact and no matter how critics want to hate it – most end up admitting it's a very decent choice for those looking for reliability and price point. P-3AT Holster Hi-Point Hi-Point makes the Walmart of pistols. Dirt cheap and backed by a life-time guarantee, despite the overwhelming bad talk about their main pistol line – this is a reasonably reliable American-made firearms manufacturer. Best of all? Hi-Point is guaranteed to produce a compact pistol in most major calibers that will fit nearly anyone's budget. Notable compact pistols: Hi-Point 916 – At less than $200 (MSRP), it's priced to sell. The Hi-Point 916 is surprisingly rugged for it's polymer frame. Hi Point 916 Holster Honorable Mention: Wilson Combat Wilson Combat's 4-inch 1911 - Wilson Combat's 4 inch 1911 was designed for those who preferred the 1911 frame and need match-grade quality in their concealed carry choice. Wilson Combat 1911 4 inch Holster< There are certainly more manufacturers that have a legacy of producing their excellent firearms in the United States. If keeping your money local is your goal, certainly	1
Give a man a fish, the adage goes, and you feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish, and you feed him for a lifetime. But what happens when the one who needs fish is a fisherman? Last month, the federal government took a long-awaited step toward answering that question when Congress allocated $75 million in fisheries disaster aid. Now the hard part begins for the National Marine Fisheries Service. First it must come up with a plan to divide the assistance among six different fisheries nationwide. Then it must determine how to spend the money that goes to each region. The New England groundfishery, which targets cod, haddock, and flounders, received its disaster declaration in 2012 following decades of overfishing, and a failure of fish populations to recover despite increasingly strict limits on the catch. In addition to excessive harvest of fish, the ecosystem has also suffered from the compounding challenge of climate change. Advertisement Together, these factors have left it dangerously out of balance. With this influx of cash, which could represent the last hope for America's first fishery, regulators and fishermen must weigh their desire to provide immediate assistance to industry members against the opportunity to make the entire groundfishery more solvent. The easy path — one for which some industry members and local politicians have advocated — would have regulators simply divide the money among active fishermen, allowing them to pay down their loans and perhaps save their boats or houses for another year or two. But then what? This fishery won't recover for far longer than that. Get Today in Opinion in your inbox: Globe Opinion's must-reads, delivered to you every Sunday-Friday. Sign Up Thank you for signing up! Sign up for more newsletters here According to a recent report from the National Marine Fisheries Service, groundfish revenue fell by $24 million in 2012, a 23 percent decline. And this plunge doesn't account for drastic reductions in catch limits which took effect in 2013 and will remain for at least another two years. When the revenue figures for 2013 come out, things will undoubtedly look much worse than they do today. Thus, no matter how much of the $75 million ends up in New England, there won't be enough to sustain the industry until the fish come back. Absent adequate fish or funding to solve the problem, the only solution is to reduce the number of fishermen, something that is already occurring albeit in an unplanned way. Since 2009, the number of boats making at least one groundfish trip has dropped by 30 percent. And it will fall further. One way regulators should help to responsibly manage this loss of fishing businesses, is through implementation a buyback of groundfish permits. While the total amount likely won't be enough to fund the entirety of a buyback program, a relatively small amount of disaster funding could be used for a federal loan guarantee, leveraging additional cash to buy permits from willing sellers. Those who remain would then pay back the loan over time using a percentage of revenue they generate from having access to more fish. Additional funds could also be made available to cover the first year or two of interest payments. Past attempts to implement buyback programs in US fisheries have shown that designing an effective framework isn't easy, but it can be done. In groundfishery, the industry must develop a structure that allows for a graceful exit from the fishery for those who choose it while preventing a scenario in which the only surviving operators are large vessels consolidated in fewer fishing ports. Advertisement The program must not simply shift the focus onto other fisheries like monkfish or lobster. And it must allow access to the next generation of fishermen once fish populations have begun to bounce back, with continued participation in traditional ports from downeast Maine out to Provincetown and down to Long Island. Because the upfront cost of a buyback would be low, it could be just a small part of a broader disaster relief package. There would still be funding to alleviate fishermen's financial hardship, to implement programs aimed at protecting smaller fishing communities, and to pay fishermen who remain to engage in cooperative research programs with scientists. Accepting a buyback will be no easy decision for many fishermen. Any New Englander knows fishing is not just a job. It's a way of life — often one that spans generations. There will be anguish in leaving it behind. But for some, there will also be relief. And for those who remain, less competition may mean a real chance at a future. Regardless of how the agency and the industry decide to allocate the funding, it must be used to not just buoy the existing industry, but primarily to invest in its future. They may not be able to give fishermen more fish. But they may yet be able to make this fishery last a lifetime. Michael Conathanis director of ocean policy at the Center for American Progress.	1
When I saw the announcement last week from RunKeeper and Pebble that RunKeeper had released the final non-beta integration with the smart-watch, I was excited to dive into it. While the Pebble watch was certainly not the first smart watch out there (that title goes to a long line of poorly designed watches aimed at geeks like me), it was the first watch to get massive media attention. Which in turn translated to massive Kickstarter sales and funding. Becoming at the time the biggest Kickstarter project ever (by funds raised). During their Kickstarter campaign a year ago both Pebble and RunKeeper had touted the potential integration between the two companies. After all, it was the very first app partnership announced. It seemed like it might just be the start of a new wave of fitness watches driven by the phone. For those not familiar with Pebble as a concept, it's a smart-phone connected watch that displays notifications from apps (be it e-mail, texts or 3rd party apps) on your wrist. The idea was that apps could leverage Pebble for deeper integration and control – ultimately minimizing the need to remove your phone from your pocket. It would still be there, you just won't have to touch it as often. However, after using it, there's really only one word to describe it: Underwhelmed. No wait, there's another one. Well, actually, an image might be better: So why am I so un-impressed? Well, let's go through a brief overview. First, you'll need the RunKeeper app installed. Quite logically obviously, since in the Pebble 'design', the app is driving the experience. No problems, I had that and was good to go! Note, available on both Android and iOS. Now, there isn't really any configuration options for the Pebble watch within RunKeeper. You can't turn it on or off, it's just…well…there. You can see it in this tiny little icon in the upper left corner: Essentially if your Pebble is nearby, it's about to get RunKeeper'd. Once that's done, you're basically ready to run. You'll just want to hit the big 'Start Activity' button on the app and stash your phone somewhere. I stash mine in a simple armband. Nothing fancy. About 15 seconds later, the run will actually start. This is a timer delay built-in to ensure you have time to do the stashing. In the meantime, the Pebble display will now change to the RunKeeper page: Once you've started your run, the watch will display your total time, total distance and average pace. If you want to pause the timer (like at a cross-walk such as below), you simply press the middle Pebble button, which pauses the app on the phone instantly. Same goes for resuming. I'll give credit where credit is due, this part works well. Next, if you want to change the display field to something other than pace, you'll just press one of the up/down buttons. Oh. Wait. You mean those buttons don't do anything? Oh, I see. No worries, I must be able to configure it somewhere else, right? You know, like in the RunKeeper app settings on my phone or something. Or change to speed for cycling? Or trigger a lap, right? No, no, and no? Oh. Hmm. So, what can you do Mr. RunKeeper Pebble? That's it? You mean, this post isn't destined for In-Depth Review status? Well then. That's…uhh…underwhelming. And thus, the end of my Pebble/RunKeeper experience. I guess I don't get it. As it stands now, the level of coding displayed seems to rival that of what a single high school student could do in an afternoon (without even a can of Mountain Dew or pizza). They had a YEAR to do something cool. And ultimately, it does the most basic thing on earth – display three non-changeable data fields. They had a year to sit there and make a mess of Cambridge whiteboards on creating a kick-ass app that could have shown the rest of the smart-watch world what an app could have done in a connected device scenario. Surely that's 365 days of back of the napkin ideas that could have been implemented. They had a year to leverage the power of Bluetooth Smart on the phone platform and do stuff like show heart rate metrics that RunKeeper already supports today. How hard could it really have been to simply add a way to customize the data pages? Or to create laps? Or to show laps since RunKeeper was tracking them anyway. On RunKeeper	1

In women, the association between obesity and endometrial cancer is stronger than in any other type of cancer. In women, the association between obesity and endometrial cancer is stronger than in any other type of cancer.1 Recent analyses predict a 55% increase in endometrial cancer rates from 2010 to 2030.2 "Obesity results in a state of increased estrogen, which drives the cells of the lining of the uterus to grow and divide. In addition, the 'brakes' are also not working as well in obese women. The 'brakes' are from progesterone, which is lower in obese women," said Karen H. Lu, MD, J. Taylor Wharton distinguished chair in gynecologic oncology at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, in an interview with Cancer Therapy Advisor. The increased levels of estrogen in obese women causes increased cellular proliferation and increased double-stranded DNA breaks, resulting in DNA instability and mismatch repair defects. Continue Reading Below "Some estrogen metabolites are also known to be genotoxic. The more frequently endometrial cells divide, the greater the accumulation of genetic mutations, which can ultimately result in neoplastic transformation," continued 1 of the review's co-authors, Rosemarie E. Schmandt, PhD, an associate professor at the department of gynecologic oncology and reproductive medicine at MD Anderson Cancer Center. "This is particularly relevant in women with Lynch syndrome, who lack certain DNA repair mechanisms, and are more likely to acquire early, deleterious mutations in the endometrium, which lead to cancer." RELATED: Use of Aromatase Inhibitors in Advanced Endometrial Cancer "Obesity is associated with elevated levels of insulin, IGF-1, and glucose levels, all of which promote endometrial growth and fuel endometrial cancer progression," explained Dr Schmandt.	1
Olivier Giroud believes Arsenal must bolster their attacking options before the transfer window closes even if it means competing for a place with a high profile star. The French international appears to be the club's first choice (only?) striker as things stand and picked up where he left off in pre-season with a tidy finish to open his account against Villa. However, with Yaya Sanogo lacking any top flight experience and Lukas Podolski seemingly destined to ply his trade on the left, there were few options to replace the former-Montpellier man as he tired in the second half. Having welcomed links with Luis Suarez earlier in the summer, the attacker told Le Parisien (link paywalled, alternative here) after Saturday's opening day defeat that he still thinks arrivals are needed. "In my opinion, it's necessary for the club to recruit another striker. "Obviously, I think about it a little bit. It may have an influence, especially if it's a high profile signing. "It's useless lamenting this though. I know what I have to do and what I'm capable of. I'm focusing on me and my work. The coach is counting on me, so I don't think too much." Looking back on his first year in England, Giroud continued: "The first year I acclimatised! The season was good, but I know I can do better. I learned much and improved a great deal. I know how the defenders behave, how to position against them, and how to be smart in the duels. This experience is invaluable. "Individually, I want to score more than 17 goals in my last year, and do better than my 10 assists. I want to be more decisive and effective." Arseblog News has already documented the number of times players have spoken in the press about the need for new recruits. For some time now it's felt like they're pushing the boss to act as much as the fans. On one level it's great that they are receptive to competition, on the other it's very worrying that squad morale could be seriously damaged by inaction. If they think extra quality is needed to challenge for honours, do they believe they can achieve that aim without it? Perhaps not… ___ Thanks to @GrooverBlog for the help with the translation.	1
In The Arena Barack Obama's Better Half Why the first lady is so popular. Michelle Obama is a popular first lady. On average, her favorable ratings have been higher than those of her predecessors, Laura Bush and Hillary Clinton. This may well reflect the fact that more so than other first ladies, Mrs. Obama has a stand-alone personal image. Unlike other recent first ladies, her popularity has not fallen or risen with her husband's. How popular is Michelle? A steady two-thirds of the public has held a favorable view of Mrs. Obama, according to nationwide Gallup poll and Pew Research Center surveys, for most of her time as first lady. At 69 percent, her average Pew Research Center favorable ratings have been only somewhat higher than Laura Bush's (65 percent) but considerably higher than Hillary Clinton's (55 percent) during Bill Clinton's term in office. Story Continued Below Laura Bush was never a polarizing first lady, but views of her soured somewhat near the end of her husband's unpopular second term. In late 2007, her favorable rating fell to 54 percent from a high of 70 percent. Hillary's ratings rose and fell substantially over the course of her time in the White House, reaching a low of 42 percent in early 1996 as fallout from her spearheading her husband's unpopular health care reform effort. But they rebounded over the course of Bill Clinton's second term, especially during the height of the Monica Lewinsky scandal, when the public rallied sympathetically to the first lady. Her ratings slipped again afterward, even as Bill's approval ratings remained fairly high. The arc of Michelle's popularity is strikingly different — in fact, it's more of a flat line than an arc. Barack's sinking poll numbers haven't dragged down Michelle. As the president's approval score has ranged from the mid 50s to the low 40s, the first lady's have oscillated around the mid to high 60s. The polls do show consistently, however, that in an era of polarization, she has been much less well liked by conservatives, Republicans and white men. Her biggest fans have been women, Democrats and African-Americans. So why did the president's unpopularity drag down Laura Bush's and Hillary Clinton's numbers but not Michelle Obama's? In-depth polling about perceptions of her by The Washington Post/Kaiser Family Foundation suggests that broad segments of the public hold positive views of Michelle's personal qualities that transcend partisanship, gender and race. Supermajorities of men and women, blacks and whites, Republicans and Democrats alike see Michelle as intelligent, a good role model for women and a good mother. And even though Republicans, white men and conservatives have held only mixed views of her overall, her strong positive image has prevented a sharp downturn in attitudes among groups that have become super critics of the president. In short, more so than other recent first ladies, the public views Michelle Obama as her own person, and her image has not been tied closely to swings in judgments about her husband. The numbers inevitably raise the question of what Michelle will do with her popularity — an increasingly rare asset in these hyperpartisan times. In recent weeks, as rumors circulated that she might run for Senate in Illinois, Michelle quickly quashed them, telling Robin Roberts of ABC News that her next act would be "service focused," not political. Roberts pressed: "You sure you're not getting into politics?" Replied Michelle: "I am positive." White House adviser Valerie Jarrett, a longtime Obama family friend, was even more Shermanesque in a recent appearance on NBC's "Meet the Press." "I'm absolutely 100 percent positive that will never happen." That seems like a pretty firm no. It should also be borne in mind that in this highly polarized era, any political move will be judged in a much more partisan way than Michelle Obama has experienced thus far — witness how Hillary Clinton's poll numbers have slid as she has reentered the political arena. But should she change her mind, the first lady would have a strong head start. Andrew Kohut is founding director of the Pew Research Center.	1
Spring is the ideal time to tour the Arts District. Let's walk down Granby and begin to identify green spaces. In time we can take ownership, and watch our ideas grow. Ever want to plant wildflowers in a vacant lot? Is there a business on Granby Street where the curb appeal should be creatively updated? Do terms like vertical gardens, upcycling, or guerilla gardening turn you on? Do plants and flowers make you feel good? Who wants to start a community butterfly garden? Do you dream about fresh rosemary and parsley? Does this cabin fever make you want to grow legal herbs outside? Maintain your own food plot? Let's plant green life in the Arts District, and watch the community flourish. Plants give off energy! Let's give them a place to root. art | "the" walt taylor When: 10am, Saturday, March 8th, 2014 Meeting location: The New Plot, (Former Zedds corner of Onley/Granby) Participants will be split into groups and given a section of the Arts District. We will then identify potential blank canvases for future art or planting. Each team will use a worksheet to describe an area, recording the address, and snapping a picture. Teams will then submit information to Ashley Grove to compile a catalog of the area. Looking for enthusiastic volunteers! Initial vision: 10 to 20 small and large green spaces, which are created and maintained by individuals, children, families, local business, artists, restaurants, green thumbs, entrepreneurs, master gardeners and beginners. A group leader or "Head Gardener" for each plot. Some "plots" small enough for individuals, others maintained by a group, a local restaurant , or even sponsored by a business. Planting VA native plants? Having an herb garden? Children's area? Outdoor yoga area? Above mentioned opportunities will be documented, photographed before and after, and possibly "sponsored." I want to encourage all sociodemographic groups to have opportunity. Even recruit and encourage diversity. Follow up with meetings, talks, on-line groups and discussions, events, plant sales. Could morph into farmer's market, open air market. Mission: Add greenlife to Arts & Design District. Create community. Create relationships and desire in businesses and individuals to take ownership of an area, beautify it, and maintain it. Facebook Comments	1

Meanwhile, the 3DS can run games much more closely with those of Gamecube level graphics, although, again, not quite at its level. It's simply stronger, more advanced hardware, and it wouldn't make sense for the games to run on an older, less powerful system.

The Royce Hall on the campus of UCLA in Los Angeles in this file photo. (Kevork Djansezian/Getty Images) Chinese Consulate Behind University Protest Against Dalai Lama The University of California–San Diego has invited the Dalai Lama to speak at commencement in June, and a group of Chinese students at the university is rallying to stop his speech. There may be more to the events than meets the eye, however, as a social media posting said to be from the student group states it has been given directions by the Chinese Consulate. The Dalai Lama is the spiritual leader of Tibet and has been in exile since March 1959, when he fled Tibet fearing the Chinese occupiers intended to abduct him. Tibet was invaded by the Chinese Communist Party's (CCP) People's Liberation Army in October 1950. The CCP pushes a line that it "liberated" Tibet and heavily censors information on the topic, while calling the Dalai Lama a "separatist." The group trying to prevent the speech is a local branch of the Chinese Student and Scholars Association (CSSA), a nationwide student organization known to receive funding and directives from the CCP through its consulates in the United States. The CSSA has openly stated it is working under the guidance of the Chinese regime. It published a statement on WeChat (a Chinese instant messaging platform) that states, translated from Chinese, that "the Chinese Student and Scholar Association has asked the Chinese Consulate in Los Angeles for instructions and, having received the instructions, is going to implement them." It tells students to not act outside official guidance of the CCP, and says "specific measures to be taken will be elaborated on in future announcements." "Our association has been forced to take tough and unyielding measures," it states. The statement appears to have been taken offline, but a web archive of the page is still available. The "About Us" page for the CSSA at the university, translated from Chinese, says it is a "public benefit organization" and is "affiliated to the Chinese Consulate General in Los Angeles." It also says it works as a "Chinese Embassy bridge." Overt Espionage According to the report "China's Espionage Dynasty: Economic Death by a Thousand Cuts," published by cybersecurity think tank Institute for Critical Infrastructure Technology (ICIT), there are active CSSAs at more than 150 U.S. universities. Officially, the CSSAs help native Chinese students by acting as a bridge between China and foreign institutions. On the other hand, "CSSAs may also be a pivotal overt espionage platform for the Chinese government," says the ICIT report. "The vast majority of CSSAs receive funding from the Chinese government or have an active liaison via the consulate back to the CCP," it states. It adds that CSSAs may work to "persuade students to act as temporary or prolonged intelligence assets," and that "through CSSAs, students can be manipulated into passing intellectual property or research back to their home state or planting malware on a university system." According to an FBI podcast on April 14, 2014, it's not uncommon for foreign intelligence agencies to manipulate students to achieve their objectives—and the students are often unaware they are being used until they're already in over their heads. "To foster the relationship, foreign intelligence operatives will flatter and encourage students, show interest in their future success, and even promise to help them obtain a government-issued visa or work permit—but it's all disingenuous and empty promises," said Mollie Halpem, host of the "Inside the FBI" podcast. She added, "The truth is, the operatives are just using the student as a pawn to achieve their own ends, without concern for the student's welfare or future." Controlling the Narrative Preventing a speech by the Dalai Lama at a U.S. university may not seem like a big deal, but for the CCP, its use of censorship and controlled narratives are cornerstones of its hold on power. The Party simultaneously pushes its own narratives on issues, peppered with disinformation, while also using extreme censorship to stop the true narratives from being known. The issue of Tibet—which includes the CCP's suppression of Tibetan Buddhists—is one of the CCP's five "no-go topics," which also includes its persecution of Falun Gong, its persecution of Muslim Uyghurs, the issue of Taiwanese independence, and the issue of democracy in Hong Kong. The CCP's censorship apparatus stretches beyond its own borders, and looks to control similar narratives being raised by foreign governments and news outlets. "In many cases, Chinese officials directly impede independent reporting by media based abroad," states a 2013 report from the Center for International Media Assistance. It adds, however, that "more prevalent–and often more effective–are methods of control that subtly	1
The Pentagon has spent billions of dollars on efforts to make itself audit-ready in time for not one, but two deadlines – one in 2014, the other in 2017. It won't meet the first and probably won't meet the second. The deadlines represent efforts inside and outside of the Pentagon toward meeting a goal that has eluded it since the mid-1990s, when all government departments were first required by law to submit to annual audits. The Defense Department, alone among all federal agencies, has so far failed to meet that requirement – leaving trillions of dollars in cumulative annual defense budgets unaudited. Amid fierce national debate over ballooning national debt, Congress in 2009 passed a law to prod the Pentagon, setting a 2017 deadline for audit-readiness. Two years later, then-Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta added to the pressure, ordering that a significant portion of the Pentagon's books – its annual report on the status of all appropriations – be audit-ready by 2014. That report, the Statement of Budgetary Resources, is, in essence, the Pentagon's checkbook, showing the amount of money from congressional appropriations spent or committed to being spent, and the amount remaining for new spending. Without it, there is no way to budget accurately or ensure accountability. Tina Jonas, Defense Department comptroller from 2004 through 2008 and now president of UnitedHealthcare Military & Veterans, says that when she was drafting budgets, the lack of reliable financial statements made it impossible for her to know how much money the Pentagon had and how much it needed. "I didn't want to ask Congress for money that we didn't need," she says. A senior Pentagon official confirmed that the 2014 deadline won't be met. The Pentagon discreetly acknowledged the same in an unremarkable passage on page 5 of section II of the November 2012 "Financial Improvement and Audit Readiness (FIAR) Plan Status Report" from Defense Department Comptroller Robert Hale's office: "The scope of first year audits of the SBR (Statement of Budgetary Resources) in FY 2015 will be limited to audits of schedules containing only current year appropriation activity." (Panetta's order requires that the SBR be audit-ready in 2014 so that a first audit can be conducted in 2015.) That means the audit will ignore the hundreds of billions of dollars in unspent appropriations from previous years, as when, for example, Congress approves a multiyear weapons contract. The reason, Pentagon officials said, is that huge amounts of essential data have been lost in the Pentagon's accounting systems, or were never recorded in the first place. The comptroller's office said that out of $992 billion in appropriations, about $220 billion won't be examined, using estimates based on 2012 numbers. "This is a tactical change that refines the scope of the audit," said Jennifer Elzea, a spokeswoman for the secretary of defense. "It does not change the goal, which is to improve the strength of our business processes and the quality of our financial information." Comptroller Hale said through a spokesman this month: "I expect most DoD budget statements will be ready for audit. It is possible that, because of budget turmoil and other problems, a few may not be ready." Lack of trustworthy data also makes the 2017 legally mandated deadline a long shot. Absent reliable accounting systems in the military services and other defense agencies, it will remain impossible to trace specific accounting entries to the "transaction level" to determine what the money paid for and whether the goods or services were delivered. Rivalries among the military services and Defense Department offices that want to keep their own systems also stand in the way. So does the services' inability to figure out a way to value assets like ships, planes and weaponry. For these reasons, says Gordon Adams, an American University professor of U.S. foreign policy and a specialist on defense issues, "we'll get to 2017, and if past is prologue, the Defense Department will just move the goal posts again." For decades, fighting and winning the Cold War dominated Congress's permissive approach to annual Pentagon appropriations. Then Congress passed the Chief Financial Officers Act of 1992, requiring annual audits of all federal departments, did lawmakers begin to pressure the Pentagon to manage its purse like any other government department. The law mandated that the Pentagon by audit-ready by 1996. But year after year, top defense officials would appear before the House and Senate armed services committees to be scolded for missing their deadlines, and then they would set new ones. The next year, and the next, the scene was re-enacted. Congress and the White House stood back as more than half a trillion taxpayer dollars a year went unaudited. Just weeks into his new job as secretary of defense under President George W. Bush, Donald Rumsfeld stated the problem: "Our financial systems are decades old. According to some estimates, we cannot track $2.3 trillion	1
�What do you know, people outside our company actually played our games,� joked Noah Falstein, Google�s chief gamesman, in response to the turnout for his �Lucasfilm Games Postmortem� panel session at GDC 2014 this morning.  It�s the first time GDC has ever hosted a postmortem discussion of a studio, rather than a game, and while Falstein worked to guide the talk through a chronological retelling of Lucasfilm Games� formation and early work, discussion amongst the panelists � former Lucasfilm Games members Ron Gilbert, Chip Morningstar, David Fox, Peter Langston, and Steve Arnold � quickly slid into the realm of reminiscing and fond remembrances.  Peter Langston, who wrote his first computer game in 1965, was essentially the founding member of Lucasfilm Games, and the first panelist to share his memories of working at the studio.  �My main goal was to use modern technology in the games business,� said Langston, when describing how he was first hired in 1982 to start a new enterprise on behalf of Lucas, outside of the film business.  �Console games at that time were pretty crude�they had to run on machines like the Atari 2600.�  Times were so tough, said Langston, that console developers would often think of available memory in bits rather than bytes, because it was wasteful to devote a byte of memory to something if 7 bits would do.  Langston claims Lucasfilm Games took in a million dollars in its first year, even though they didn�t make any games � they made tools. But they also started experimenting with game development � one prototype generated anti-aliased graphics in real-time, while another was able to generate music from places beyond the player�s point of view. .  David Fox, a founding member of Lucasfilm Games who worked on games like Labyrinth and Zak McKracken, shared stories of trying to pitch what would become Rescue on Fractalus.  �I wanted to do a Star Wars game, but I was told that we were not allowed to do Star Wars titles,� said Fox, who had joined the company specifically to work within the Star Wars universe.  Fox says when he first showed his space fighter pilot game prototype to George Lucas, the filmmaker pointed out that Fox had failed to include a fire button -- the developer had assumed players would simply defeat enemies by outmaneuvering them and leading them into crashing into the mountains.  Steve Arnold is now an experienced venture capitalist, but back in the early '80s he left Atari to lead Lucasfilm's "Games Group," which would go on to become Lucasfilm Games.  �We were creating a culture that was designed around innovation,� said Arnold, trying to explain why Lucasfilm Games was able to produce a remarkably diverse array of games -- BallBlazer, Rescue on Fractalus, Habitat and the like -- in a relatively short span of time.  �One of the important constraints we had was that we weren�t working with Star Wars,� said Arnold. �We didn't have to play in that universe -- we got to do our own creation, and we were literally the only group � outside of George � within the Lucasfilm company that got to make up new stories and call them Lucasfilm.�  �George had simple rules for us: �Stay small, be the best, and don�t lose any money.��  To hear Arnold tell it, those rules were liberating because they inspired the team to experiment with new ideas. The culture of Lucasfilm Games that Arnold remembers was much akin to an indie film studio � the team wanted to build things that people wanted to buy, but they also wanted to make something artful.  Chip Morningstar served as a designer and programmer at Lucasfilm Games, most notably as project lead for the early graphical online game Habitat.  �One of our principles was that we never did anything with the company�s own money � we had to get someone else to pay for it,� said Morningstar, who went on to explain how early Lucasfilm Games staffers would keep an �idea file� full of game pitches that would be plundered whenever representatives of other companies would visit in order to �bask in the glow of Star Wars.  When a representative from Quantum Link came through one day, Morningstar remembers pitching him on the idea of making something like Habitat. The guy went for it, and Morningstar suddenly found himself responsible for leading development on what would prove to be a groundbreaking online game.  �It was kind of radically egalitarian,� said Morningstar. �Almost all developers� titles were �designer/programmer� at Lucasfilm Games, and everyone was entitled to contribute.�  Ron Gilbert, a veteran developer known for his work on critically-acclaimed games like Maniac Mansion and The Cave, shared his own memories of the relatively flat operating hierarchy	1
Tanaka, and the second part is a series of the aforementioned interviews in segments called "Portrait of an Otaku".The animation first:Kubo and Tanaka were college friends; Kubo the typical Gary Stu kind of guy- tennis team, has a beautiful girlfriend, scholar, and everything seems right in his life, except he's rather bored. He meets up with Tanaka by chance in an elevator, and from that fateful reunion on is slowly drawn into the Otaku lifestyle of making fanfiction magazines, garage kits (modified figurines), and eventually full on anime and video games in an attempt to become the OTAKING- King of the Otakus!After rising to the top, Kubo and Tanaka get screwed, and then have to decide what it was that was really important to them- the grubbing, hand to mouth lifestyle of being an artist and original creator, or selling out and making all the money. There's only one true path for the Otaking, and that's to take it beyond the stars.----The pacing is broken up by the interviews, but the narrative is both engaging and humorous, along with providing a very loose version of how Gainax was started, and their goals of shooting for the stars, both in animation and in business practices. It's very interesting to see how Otaku no Video inspired later works, and drew from the doujinshi (amateur produced works) that put Gainax on the map. Real life science fiction conventions Daicon 3 and 4 (1981, 1983) are explored, which Gainax also produced shorts for. Other character stylings and symbols seen in later works also make appearances, like Kamina's glasses on a building, robots from Gunbuster, and more.-----Portrait of an Otaku:Through a series of live interviews, the movie also explores the lives and disparate interests of those who call themselves Otaku. Garage Kit Otaku, Military Otaku, Anime and Manga, Fanzines, Cosplay enthusiasts, and Fan Video Otaku, and even an art thief are all shown, and asked series of questions that either mock their interests and lifestyle, or that give some insight into what it is that drives them to their obsession.While it's believed that the people interviewed were either Gainax employees themselves (who created their studio to put a name behind their amateur original works, and thereby personifying some of these stereotypes), some of it is plainly staged. Hideaki Anno himself is shown as a Hentai-game addict, even. Typically, the faces and voices are censored, so it's still unknown who some of them are. It's interesting in that they're making fun of Otaku, and at the same time themselves, because that's how Gainax started out: geeks making their own originals to hawk at conventions.The portrait section also provides some hilarious statistics on what Otaku are interested in, and how different groups see different themes. A foreigner was also intereviewed, and it was stated that some 50% of those surveyed come to Japan solely out of anime and manga fandom, and the other half either "like" or "are not opposed" to it. A fanzine convention survey of 100 Otaku revealed that only 15% of them had cosplayed, and an overwhelming 60% had not. Of those 15 that responded yes, the "Otaku who did cosplay tended to be repeat offenders".Another survey included those who "talk to themselves", of which the overwhelming majority with 70% did.-----There's also a deep sociological background to Otaku culture; stemming from how a more collectivist culture like Japan operates vs an intensely individualistic one like the US. "The nail that sticks out gets hammered" they say, and to a point, it's true. In a collectivist culture, the ideal person fits in with their group, their family, their society, and don't express their individualism much when around others. In private, they can be a night and day different person.The Otaku have long been branded as "no life losers", and in a sense shunned from their culture as they're perceived "deviant", no different from the US, really. People with anime and manga obsession, people obsessed with doomsday preparation, zombie fanatics, etc.-all these groups share a common thread in that they're on the fringe of 'normative' society. In that, they find a bond together, and create their own subculture outside of the norms.For anyone who's interested in the Otaku culture, this half mockumentary is a great video for insight into what it was like back in the day, even if it's somewhat parodical. In all honesty, what they portray satirically here is not far from the truth, neither in 1991 nor in 2015. There are tons of people out there like the ones shown in this movie, that are obsessive enthusiasts of different fandoms, and though their interests may be broad, they're all bound by a label	1
The demonstration of the new robot's abilities. Credit: ​RT/YouTube. On Tuesday, the Russian military unveiled a prototype of its new combat robot, designed to look and act like our favorite science fiction androids. Vladimir Putin himself traveled to the town of Klimovsk, where the robot was developed by the Russian Defense Institute "Tochmash," to watch the robo-soldier in action. Putin looked on as the robot fired five gunshots, and drove an ATV cautiously around a snowy track with a random fire in the background. But despite the sophistication of the android, the Russian President seemed visibly bored by its antics. Perhaps he was imagining something more in the vein of the Terminator, and less like an anemic RoboCop, or a droid you might find at a Jawa yard sale. If I was told that I was going to watch a new warrior robot take a quad bike out for a spin, I probably would've been disappointed how epically unintimidating the end result was, too. Indeed, the cherry on the cake is that this robot wasn't even driving the vehicle autonomously—​it was operated remotely by a Tochmash engineer. Unless further details were left out of Russia Today's video coverage of the unveiling, it's basically a glorified remote control toy car. But with guns. According to Sputnik News, ​future versions of the robot will be able to provide emergency first aid, assist in the construction of infrastructure, and travel over difficult terrains. The project is part of a larger Russian initiative to revitalize the military with "autonomous tanks, unmanned vehicles, and other weapons one won't be ashamed of in the 21st century," ​according to Russia Today. That all sounds interesting, if it does come to fruition. But for now, Putin's "meh" expression pretty much sums up our feelings about the terrifying new robot soldier that appears to drive at a stultifying four miles an hour.	1
San Antonio commuters in 2012 wasted 12.4 hours stuck in gridlock traffic, according to a new report by Inrix, the international traffic information company.  That puts San Antonio at the 34th worst city in the nation for traffic congestion.  Inrix stresses that the 12.4 hours is not the time motorists spent commuting in general last year. That is simply the amount of extra time that we wasted because traffic was stopped on the highway.  But the real story from the Inrix report is Austin. The Capital City now has the fourth worst traffic congestion in the country. Austin congestion is worse that New York City, and trails only Los Angeles, Honolulu, and San Francisco when it come sto time spent wasted in highway congestions.  Inrix says traffic around the country is getting worse because the economy is getting better. Nowhere is that more noticeable than in the comparisons between traffic in the U.S. and in Europe.  While two thirds of U.S. cities experiences increaeed traffic congestion in the first three months of 2013, most cities in Europe, which is in a recession, have seen traffic declines in the same period.  In fact, the coutnries with the biggest declines in traffic have he hgihest rate sof unemployment as they continue to struggle throught he European debt crisis, Inrix ssid.  Austin commuters spent 38 hours, or nearly a full work week, stuck in traffic in 2012, and that figure is up significantly just this year.  Several locations along I-35 in Austin are among the worst stretches of highway in the country for commuters.  The single worst stretches of traffic in America are the Cross Bronx Expressway in New Yrok City, the San Diego Freeway in Los Angeles, and the Santa Monica Freeway, which is Interstate 10, also in L.A. Inrix says it is not uncommon for people who have to commute to work on those freeways routinely take 45 minutes or more to travel two miles during rush hours, and waste sixty hours a week or more stuck in traffic.	1
By Bernard Hickey Prime Minister John Key has given the strongest signal yet that he expects the Reserve Bank to announce new measures to limit lending to rental property investors as the Government grapples with double-digit housing inflation and the Reserve Bank faces having to cut interest rates again. Key told reporters before Question Time in Parliament he expected the Reserve Bank to take action sooner rather than later as he responded to questions about figures from Barfoot and Thompson and QV showing rental property investors jumping in and house prices accelerating ahead of an expected third round of Loan to Value Ratio (LVR) controls. He was asked about what the Reserve Bank was considering, given it announced earlier on Tuesday that Deputy Governor Grant Spencer would deliver a speech on Thursday evening that covered the areas of macro-prudential policy and the housing market. Spencer and Governor Graeme Wheeler signaled on June 9 they were considering the potential for a third round of LVR controls before the end of the year "or before that." See our article on that here. Speculation has intensified in recent weeks that the Reserve Bank could either lower the current 70% LVR threshold for rental property investors in Auckland, and/or extend it to the rest of the country. Key said he did not know what Spencer would say in the speech, but that the Government had been having regular discussions with the Reserve Bank about the issue. 'They should get on with it' Asked about Spencer's planned speech and whether the Reserve Bank needed to introduce a third round of controls on investors, he said: "Yeah, I think there is a responsibility for the Reserve Bank to have a look at the question around investors. We've had those discussions with the Reserve Bank." "They can control that part of the market and I don't know exactly what he'll say on Thursday, but certainly the government's perspective I think has been that having a look at that might make some sense," he said. Asked if the Reserve Bank could extend the Auckland investor restrictions across the country and/or further lower the threshold in Auckland, Key said: "My own view is that he should make some movements in that area, yes." Asked if he was optimistic about the Reserve Bank further tightening those restrictions, he said: "Not on Thursday, but over time, potentially." Key said he had had broad ranging discussions with the Reserve Bank. "It's a double edged sword, of course. You need investors in the market to make sure there is rental property, but my sense is that potentially one of the risks is that you have got people buying properties at the moment, borrowing more money, but fearful that the Reserve Bank is going to move," he said. "So if they are going to make changes, probably better they should get on with it." Key was then asked if it was an issue all over the country or just in Auckland. "It depends a little bit. It's in those high growth areas. Actually if you look at the QV data, Auckland did go up, obviously, rapidly, but places like Tauranga and Hamilton were faster." Asked if he preferred the Reserve Bank should focus on Auckland or all of the country, he said: "They should look at those high growth areas."	1
While seated in the visitors dugout and holding court with the media, the Orioles uniform-adorned manager Buck Showalter is asked if he liked wearing those duds. "No," the Orioles manager replies wryly. "Have you seen me in a uniform?" Despite his self-deprecating humor, the 59-year-old skipper presents a more graceful look than other older or more rotund managers. Dodgers manager Tommy Lasorda still sported a uniform at 68, and so did 69-year-old Phillies manager Charlie Manuel. "You have Jack McKeon at age 80 dressed up like a jockey," says John Thorn, Major League Baseball's official historian. Decked out in the same MLB uniforms as their players, these figures make for a peculiar -- and unique -- sight. In the other major sports, the coaches wear suits or sport coats (basketball and hockey) or a team logoed top and pants (football). "We're glad we're different," Orioles reliever Tommy Hunter says. "It's a niche that baseball has." That niche actually has a historical precedent. During the origins of the game, the business manager -- who made travel arrangements, handled the books and ensured players received appropriate compensation -- was called the "manager." He wore street clothes. The "captain," who typically was a uniformed player, determined the batting order, made player substitutions and pitching changes, etc. He was basically what would be later known as a player/manager. Around 1900, according to Thorn, the term "manager" stopped referring to the business manager and began referring to the person making strategic moves, player substitutions, etc. The original "manager" would evolve into the modern-day general manager, and the player/manager would eventually fall out of vogue. (Only six -- Hank Bauer, El Tappe, Frank Robinson, Joe Torre, Don Kessinger and Pete Rose -- have occupied the latter role since 1960.) By the 1940s managers Connie Mack of the Philadelphia A's and Burt Shotton of the Brooklyn Dodgers wore street clothes long after their playing days had expired, but they were the exceptions. Presently, MLB's only official rule regarding the matter is 1.11 (a) (1) and states: "All players on a team shall wear uniforms identical in color, trim and style, and all players' uniforms shall include minimal six-inch numbers on the back." Note that managers are never specifically referenced. When asked about the discrepancy, MLB released this statement: "The tradition of managers and coaches wearing uniforms has long been an accepted practice and well understood, even without formal rules being in place." MLB managers seem agreeable toward the understood rule regarding uniforms. "It's better than wearing a suit," White Sox manager Robin Ventura says. But it's also a bit perplexing, considering the clubs' trainers wear short-sleeve polo shirts and khaki pants, and their job of working on players' injured joints seems as physically taxing -- if not more so -- as any manager's. "It's a lot of work to put on the whole uniform," says Orioles All-Star closer Zach Britton, "especially for the manager when there's no need for you to go sliding or diving." *** When eccentric Braves owner Ted Turner made the brazen move to manage his team for one game on May 11, 1977, he crammed a chunk of chaw in his cheek and sported jersey No. 27. "He had never been a player, never been a coach, never worn a uniform, but for the day that he was manager, he was outfitted with a uniform," Thorn says. "That tells you something about the strength of the tradition." Some managers dress like their players -- down to the very last detail. Showalter wears stirrups. Bobby Cox wore a cup and spikes for every game. "You never see a manager wearing actual cleats … It was hilarious," says Adam LaRoche who played for Cox while with the Braves from 2004-2006. "It's just his style. He went from playing right into coaching and managing and never took his cleats off." Cox, who has the most ejections in managerial history with 158, explained part of the rationale behind his shoes to Sports Illustrated: "Could you imagine going out there in shiny dress shoes?" he said. "How would you kick dirt on the umpire?" There are other reasons why it does make sense -- as silly as it might look -- for managers to wear uniforms. One is the weather. Baseball is the only major sport played outside in the dog days of summer when the heat can be oppressive. "George Costanza had it right," Showalter joked, in reference to the Seinfeld episode in which	1

Plus/Minus Functions and Quadra Values by Victor Gulenko . +/- signs have seen various interpretations and changes over time. Please refer to this article for further information: http://www.the16types.info/vbulletin...unctions-Eglit Discussion thread - http://www.the16types.info/vbulletin...042#post584042 Original article - http://socioniko.net/ru/articles/quadra-soc-psy.html Notes: Remember. These are +/- descriptions. They're not descriptions of the full functions, which are much, much more complex. They only describe how one Reinin dichotomy (process/result) alters the function -- one out of a possible fifteen. That's right! Just one stinking dichotomy. So don't complain that they're simplistic descriptions of your personality, because they're not meant to convey very much about you anyway.ALPHA-Fe= minimization or avoidance of negative emotions, prevention of quarrels, scandals, and other situations causing emotional instability, which is valued as more important than creation of positive emotional effect.-Ti= global structural logic. Systematic analysis is the instrument that they use in understanding the world. They are primarily interested in the universal laws that govern its workings. To that end, all traditions, conventions and restrictions are discarded. Everything is subjected to analysis, redefinition, analogies. Their main goal that they are pursuing is the creation of a comprehensive, breathtaking, singular picture of the world. The idea of unity, reasonableness and the fairness in all things permeates their vision completely.+Si= positive feelings of comfort. They cannot effectively realize their potential if their lifestyle is full of hardships. Style of activity is characterized by relaxation, freedom, by conveniences. Relations with the external environment, where their activities unfold, must be friendly and pleasant. Their groups are always comfortable, relaxed as if at home, and never rough or eccentric.+Ne= promising ideas. In this quadra, which can be attributed the element of air, there are frequent talks about the future, the unexplored and unknown possibilities. They may seem to be incorrigible dreamers. And this is so: they look out further than anyone, beyond the horizon, they put forward "crazy" theories and discuss them with pleasure. Some of these theories, however, are destined to have long lives, so long that they will outlast their creators.BETA+Fe= maximization of positive emotions. Even small doses are enjoyed. Against the backdrop of the dramatic, turbulent emotions that always accompany this quadra, every small occurrence deserving a positive response is seen as an occasion for joy and uplifts their spirits.+Ti= organizational logic. They have a developed sense of duty, citizenship, loyalty to the elected project. It is therefore the most disciplined and organized quadra that knows how to quickly rally its forces in the event of imminent danger or emergency situations.-Se= minimization of weaknesses, i.e. steadfastness in the struggle against deprivation and resistance against the enemy. In this quadra, the force of will is an indispensable condition for effective operation. Persistence, determination, endurance and firmness are always the supreme authority.-Ni= desire to bypass danger. They aim t avoid previously committed mistakes. In their groups, experience, skill, know-how, sophistication are highly valued. They feel confident in extreme situations.GAMMA-Fi= minimization of negative relationships. This element is critical of evil. They desire to get away from bad people and poor relationships, and to protect themselves from enemies and adversaries. They want to minimize negative experiences, because as we know from psychoanalysis, all extruded problems are liable to generate an emotional reaction one way or another, with a physical cost for the purification of the subconscious.-Te= business logic of risk and entrepreneurship. For them it is characteristic to reject that which is useless, insignificant, mundane. This aspect is valued as more important than accumulation and rational consumption. Gammas successfully operate in environments of economic scarcity, where in order to survive it is necessary to use something that may appear useless at first glace, but which is present in abundance.+Se= durability and resistance. This quadra is well capable of defending itself and its position. For them power is not easy to acquire, as to do this they must resist the volitional Beta quadra. However, once it is seized, they can hold on to it despite all attempts at restoration. Protectiveness, ability to defend themselves against all force, ability to keep that which was acquired - these are the principles that they respect. This quadra can be called the quadra of criticism and reforms. In contrast to the 'fire' Beta quadra, which is oriented primarily politically, this quadra is oriented more socially.+Ni= constraining their hot temper, these sociotypes prefer to advance gradually into the future, though they may sharply reject obsolete ideas, criticizing past mistakes.

Chris Froome is certain he is on track to contend for a fourth Tour de France victory next month despite his not managing to win the Critérium du Dauphiné, traditionally his warm-up race for La Grande Boucle. The Team Sky leader won the eight-day race in France each time before his Tour victories in 2013, 2015 and 2016 but this year could finish only fourth to the Dane Jakob Fuglsang. "I'm not the superstitious type, to think that winning the Dauphiné is a precursor to winning the Tour," Froome says. "It's certainly good for the morale and the confidence to win your last race before the Tour but I don't think it's a prerequisite." Chris Froome's Tour de France win puts him among greats | William Fotheringham Read more The 32-year-old Briton added that. if he was not at his peak in June, that might be explained by the need to keep his powder dry for later in the season. "I have been very light on race days this year – going into the Dauphiné I was on 19 race days – but that has been a conscious decision to keep me fresher for what's to come. "Potentially with the Tour and the Vuelta a España afterwards it could be a busy summer of racing. It's worked in the past going into this part of the season fresher. I feel the Dauphiné was just what I needed in terms of intensity and it was a very intense Dauphiné – especially the back end of it. When we hit the mountains it was a full-on race and it will have moved me on, condition-wise, a lot." Unlike in other years Froome has yet to score his first win of the season but that barely seems to worry him. However, he professes fascination with a radical route for this year's race that includes nine potential sprint stages and only two genuine mountain-top finishes, at Peyragudes in the Pyrenees and the Col d'Izoard in the Alps, with a third, smaller one at Plateau des Belles Filles in eastern France. "I genuinely think this year's Tour route presents the biggest challenge to me that I've faced in my career to date. It's an open course and the level of my rivals is higher than it has ever been. It will be a much closer race in July, more hard fought than we've seen in the last few years. I think what strikes me most is the lack of time-trial kilometres." There are only two time trials in the Tour this year: 13 kilometres on the opening stage, this Saturday in Düsseldorf, and 22 kilometres in Marseille on the final Saturday three weeks later. That is a massive contrast with the 1990s and the noughties when there might be two stages against the watch of up to 50 or 60 kilometres, a prologue time trial and possibly a team time trial. Chris Froome wins third Tour de France in Paris – as it happened Read more It follows a recent trend, as the 2015 Tour won by Froome had an even smaller amount of individual time-trialling. This year, however, the race is short of obvious set-piece stages, as Froome notes. "It's not as if it's been made up for with mountain-top finishes, it's also very light on those. It's a very open race. Of course there are some mountain-top finishes – the Izoard stage, for example, that's going to be a straightforward general classification race up to almost 2,500m. You've got a very open course, almost begging for riders to be more aggressive, to take opportunities to create situations on the road that will lead to exciting racing. "It will be interesting to see if that happens or if it's a more controlled race, because the guys are watching and waiting because there are so few typical general classification days, the [favourites] will get their teams to ride and wait for those rather than going for it. It will be interesting to see who is going there with what kind of tactics." That is far from the only source of speculation. Froome will race this year's Tour against the backdrop of an eight-month long investigation by UK Anti-Doping into allegations of possible wrongdoing at Team Sky in the wake of the Jiffy bag saga. That culminated in the revelation that the team had acquired 55 doses of the corticosteroid triamcinolone between 2010 and 2013, with no paper trail to explain what it was used for. Triamcinolone is banned, unless used under certain conditions with a therapeutic use exemption, and is known to enhance performance. There have also been reports of dissent within Team Sky over the affair, with the role of the Sky principal, Sir	1
ESPN college basketball analyst Andy Katz, right, broadcasts courtside. (Phelan M. Ebenhack/Associated Press) For the second year in a row, Disney is poised to have another "Star Wars" megahit on its hands with the company on track to sell $130 million in U.S. pre-release tickets for next week's "Rogue One." But no matter how well it performs at the box office, the film's success may be overshadowed by Disney investors' rising alarm about another part of the Magic Kingdom: ESPN, which is shedding viewers in record numbers. ESPN was thrust into the spotlight in November when the ratings company Nielsen predicted the sports juggernaut would lose 621,000 cable subscribers that month. Nielsen estimated the sports network would lose another 555,000 subscribers in December. The staggering losses have led to calls by analysts for Disney to spin off or sell the beleaguered network, which has lost 9 million subscribers in three years, according to company filings. The challenges ahead are not unique to ESPN. The pay-TV industry as a whole has seen many consumers trim back their cable subscriptions in favor of online video services — or, fed up with the rising cost of TV, forgo cable altogether. With YouTube TV on the horizon and other streaming services becoming more affordable, it may be time to cancel your cable service. (Jhaan Elker/The Washington Post) "There's an underlying theme of the bundle being the problem," said Gene Kimmelman, president of the consumer advocacy group Public Knowledge. "People don't want to pay for what they don't want to get." But ESPN remains one of the world's most profitable sports networks, and its struggles raise troubling questions about the entire TV ecosystem. Long considered the linchpin of the traditional bundle, live sports is often what compels viewers to stay with their cable provider rather than cut the cord. But as more consumers defect in the face of growing cable bills, what is happening at ESPN could end up affecting channels up and down the lineup. And for Disney, one of the world's most powerful media companies, the problems at ESPN risk dampening the success of its other brands, such as Star Wars, Marvel Studios and Pixar. "Most of the Disney empire is healthy, but its stock price has been suffering to the downside because we have weak subscriber growth at ESPN," said Laura Martin, a media analyst at Needham and Co. "So that weak subscriber growth is a shadow over the whole empire." ESPN and its siblings, such as ABC, account for the biggest chunk of Disney's business by far, pulling in $24 billion in revenue this fiscal year. The company's next biggest segment, theme parks, made $17 billion. It wasn't that long ago that observers were calling ESPN "the most valuable media property in the United States," estimating its value at 20 times that of the New York Times Co. and five times the size of Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. Since hitting a high of nearly $122 in the summer of 2015, the stock has dropped about 14 percent; that includes a 5 percent rally this week. Although ESPN disputed Nielsen's methodology, the ratings firm ultimately stood by its numbers. [John Skipper is steering ESPN through turbulent times] A spokesman for ESPN referred questions to the network's parent company. Disney did not respond to multiple requests for comment. Last month, in an interview with CNBC, Disney chief executive Bob Iger said he remains confident in ESPN. "We think the long-term revenues are going to be just fine," he said. ESPN is hardly the only programming company facing long-term pressure as consumers increasingly opt for Internet-based video streaming that undercuts the legacy cable bundle. TV providers such as Dish Network and AT&T have raced to offer packages of traditional channels as Internet-based apps; the outlook for those efforts is still uncertain, but some analysts say ESPN faces a steeper challenge than most because of the rapidly rising cost to the network of acquiring sports broadcasting rights. "Let's face it - sports has changed," said Jim Hill, a longtime Disney analyst. "It's gotten so expensive ... it's a scary time all around the barn right now for sports, and that's another thing that Disney's eyeballing." The rights to broadcast live sports cost cable companies a collective $16 billion last year, according to a report from PricewaterhouseCoopers — up 50 percent from 2011. That figure is expected to grow another 30 percent by 2020. Between the rising content costs and the defection of consumers, some analysts have proposed that Disney spin off its ESPN unit. This week, Steve Cahall, a media analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said the move would allow investors to gain a better understanding of Disney's fundamental profitability. He added it could earn Disney some cash to invest in its remaining businesses, or make Disney	1

SAN DIEGO — Didi Gregorius and the Arizona Diamondbacks have plenty of experience by now in winning extra-inning games. Gregorius tripled home the tiebreaking run in the 12th inning to lift the Diamondbacks over the San Diego Padres 2-1 on Tuesday night. Arizona's 78 extra innings played this season are the most since 1920 — surpassing the 76 played by the Minnesota Twins in 1969 — but are four short of the all-time record of 82, set by the Washington Senators in 1918. The Diamondbacks are 17-7 in extra-inning games. Article continues below ... "A lot of the games we played extra innings were because of blown saves," reliever Brad Ziegler said. "But it also says a lot about our offense because there were a lot of games that we came from behind to get to extra innings, too. We've won a whole lot of those games. It's hard on the pitching staff and it's fatiguing for everybody, but we fought through and played those games well." Paul Goldschmidt hit his NL-best 36th homer for the Diamondbacks, extending his hitting streak to 14 games and increasing his league-leading RBI total to 124. It appeared his solo shot in the sixth might hold up, but the Diamondbacks were destined for another extra-inning game. Arizona took a four-hitter into the eighth before San Diego tied it on a passed ball. "We have been resilient in these games all year," Diamondbacks manager Kirk Gibson said. "You have to go through it and we hung in there. It feels good to get this win." Gregorius tripled down the right-field line against Luke Gregerson (6-8) to score fellow rookie Chris Owings, who doubled with one out. "Luke just hung a breaking ball to Owings and the ball was up to Gregorius that he put enough bat on the ball and hit it hard," San Diego manager Bud Black said. Josh Collmenter (5-4) pitched a perfect inning and Ziegler got three outs for his 12th save. Diamondbacks reliever David Hernandez gave up consecutive singles to pinch-hitter Mark Kotsay and Chris Denorfia to open the eighth inning. The right-hander then struck out Jesus Guzman, retired Jedd Gyorko on a grounder and intentionally walked Chase Headley to load the bases. With rookie Tommy Medica batting, catcher Miguel Montero allowed a passed ball on Hernandez's off-speed pitch that let pinch-runner Reymond Fuentes score the tying run. Arizona starter Wade Miley allowed just four singles, including two infield hits, in six innings. Miley, making his career-high 32nd start, struck out seven, walked one and let just one runner reach third base. Miley lost all four of his previous starts against San Diego this season. Tyson Ross kept San Diego in the game with eight strong innings, allowing one run and three hits. Ross struck out six, walked two, hit a batter and threw a wild pitch. Goldschmidt's homer to right-center barely cleared the top of the wall. "I wanted it off the plate, but it caught too much," Ross said. "He's one of the best hitters in the National League and he put a good swing on it." NOTES: During his hitting streak, Goldschmidt has six doubles, five homers and 17 RBIs. … Padres SS Ronny Cedeno wasn't in the lineup after being hit in the head by a pitch from reliever Heath Bell on Monday night. "He's not doing great," San Diego manager Bud Black said. "The doctors said (Monday) night he was concussed to a certain point." … Padres OF Will Venable (abdominal strain) missed his second straight game. … Diamondbacks RHP Randall Delgado (5-6, 3.96 ERA) faces Padres RHP Ian Kennedy (6-10, 5.06) on Wednesday night.	1
The following UFO photos are from the archives of Lt. Col. Wendelle C. Stevens, and the accompanying details have been reproduced as close to the original sighting report as possible. 19 April 1978, Colfax, Wisconsin On Wednesday 19 April 1978, Mr. S. (name witheld (sic) by specific request) and his girlfriend were driving in the vicinity of Tainter Lake, when they decided to stop and attempt some fishing since most of the ice was already thawed. They found a spot along the shore where they could do some casting. Mr. S. had also brought along an FM portable radio. They had been at this spot for about a half an hour when the radio began picking up interference. It was then that Mr. S. looked up into the sky, thinking an airplane must be going over-head. At that point the object "appeared" out of the southwest, moving northeast. He and his girlfriend became very excited and frightened. Remembering that they had a camera with them, (an Instamatic) Mr. S. went and got it to take some pictures. He almost dropped it several times trying to get it out of the case. He finally got it out and started to point it at the object when the object suddenly veered off course in their direction and came towards them. They became even more frightened but Mr. S. was determined to get a photograph of the thing! At that point, the object began to circle them at a high altitude as Mr. S. began taking pictures. The object flew around the area only once and then disappeared into the sunlight. The whole incident lasted about 3 or 4 minutes. Mr. S. was hesitant about showing anyone the photos because he was afraid of people thinking the wrong thing. He finally sent a UFO lecturer a copy after attending one of his slide lectures on the UFO subject. Mr. S. was unable to determine the size of the object for lack of reference, or how fast it was moving. He did say, however, that it gave off a "crackling sound" as it passed around them. From personal letter: Photo #1: Shows the object moments after it veered off its original course. Mr. S. said it slowed down considerably after he took the first picture. He said he had "the feeling it knew it was being photographed". Photo #2: The object is moving slower now as it begins to make its pass. At this point Mr. S. and girlfriend grew apprehensive. Both experienced extreme fear. Photo #3: The object tilts as it begins a "roller coaster" type descent. Mr. S. and friend become increasingly frightened. He has the feeling it is going to "get them". Photo #4: The object has leveled off and is just above the treetop height. It begins moving toward Mr. S. at a slow gliding pace. No sound comes from the object but Mr. S. remembers he left his transistor radio on and it is "buzzing" and "crackling like crazy". Photo #5: Mr. S. turns his camera sideways to get this shot of the object as it passes almost directly overhead. At this point Mr. S. experienced a sensation of "heat" as well as "prickling sensation" around and "in" his head and eyes, however Mr. S. stated that he experienced no permenant or temporary after-effects except a bad case of the "jitters". This shot was taken while Mr. S. was in a crouched position and remembers falling over on his back afterwards. He said he noticed an "amber or orange-red light" underneath in addition to several small lights which would blink on and off erratically for different lengths of time. (See Photograph) He also noticed 4 "pods" or "landing gear". The bottom appeared to be a "dull" black. The shock of falling backwards prevented him from taking any more pictures of the object as it continued overhead. The object has now climbed back up into the sky as Mr. S. shoots this picture. Photo #7: Shows the object heading into the sun. At this point it began to pick up speed and soon was lost in the sunlight. Mr. S. took 9 pictures in all, only these 7 turned out.

Despite the often chaotic world of professional wrestling, Total Nonstop Action (TNA) Wrestling has existed as an operating promotion since 2002, while Dixie Carter began serving as President of the company in 2003. Born in Dallas, Texas in 1964, Carter studied Business Administration at the University of Mississippi, and owned a business focusing primarily on sport and music representation in Nashville before she joined the wrestling business, initially in TNA's marketing and publicity department, before financial turmoil within the organisation saw her help broker a deal which saw her parents, under the Panda Energy banner, buy the company. Over the past decade TNA has continued to survive and has featured many of the greatest names in the history of wrestling, while also giving worldwide publicity to talents who were previously unknown. Speaking to The Independent on the phone from her office in America, Carter began the conversation by talking about the success of Challenge TV's British Bootcamp 2, the reality show which was won by TNA standout Rockstar Spud in its first instalment. "I'm proud of the show, the first season was very successful, our ratings have doubled for this one which is almost unheard of, and there is such a great talent pool from the UK and Ireland. "I hope this show has given everyone a shot in the arm to raise their game and to define their characters more, because if they really take the process seriously, every single one of those talents should come out better for it." One such talent on the show which has attracted much attention over the course of the show has been Grado, who has become one of Britain's biggest stars in the recent past, stemming from his appearances in Insane Championship Wrestling and his strong YouTube fame. Carter likes what she sees in the comedic Scot, who recently finished in the top six of the show. "I'm a big Grado fan, and I'm excited about him, and the other five finalists being on the upcoming UK tour, and there is something about him that I know he will try to steal the spotlight from everybody. He didn't get off to a good start with Al Snow in particular, he felt it was Grado's downfall that he didn't take it seriously enough, that he felt he could funny his way through it, and it really bothered Al, which could have kept him from winning." Grado has spoken about possibly facing Snow on the tour, and that is something that has piqued the interest of the TNA President. "He has been on at me for that to happen, and Al Snow is in as good condition as he has ever been in, he loves stepping into the ring but Grado would have the entire UK with him. Al would take that match very seriously, and he should be prepared." TNA has achieved a startling degree of success in the UK, thanks to their flagship television show Impact being aired on Challenge TV, and the company tour yearly in arenas which attract thousands of fans. This year, all six of the final contestants from British Bootcamp 2, Noam Dar, Kay Lee Ray, Rampage Brown, Dave Mastiff, Mark Andrews and Grado will be appearing on the shows, as well as TNA World Heavyweight Champion Bobby Roode, Magnus, Rockstar Spud, James Storm, MVP and more. The events, in Glasgow, Manchester and London will also all be taped for television, which has excited Carter. "The UK has been such an integral part of the success that we have had, it gave us an early success story when we needed one with the television ratings, ticket sales and media exposure. Now having British Bootcamp, and the tours getting bigger, I wanted to raise the bar this year and I needed to know from a scheduling standpoint in the US that I could turn the UK shows into TV tapings so I was thrilled to announce that. "Having the British Bootcamp participants on the shows is great, and I want the fans to get there early, from the time the doors open for it to be a party atmosphere, and to make it fun and special." After a nine year relationship with Spike TV, TNA has signed a deal to partner with Discovery Communications, and Impact will begin to air on Destination America in January 2015. Despite some wrestling insiders tipping the switch as a backwards move, Carter was positive about the change, and the possibilities that the partnership can bring. "I'm very excited about it, we talked with a lot of networks and at the end it came down to that I was looking for somebody who didn't want to just license a two hour television show, but somebody who wanted to be a true partner. This deal is not just about Impact on a network, and it's not just about being part of a group of networks in the US which are the largest and who have vowed their support, it's about the global reach, and I'm very confident we can help Destination America, and be one of the	1
Jared Jeffrey Height: 5'11" Weight: 165 Midfielder Born: 06/14/1990 Age: 23 Hometown: Richardson, TX Previous Club: Mainz (Germany) Acquired via the waiver draft on July 3, 2013. D.C. United today announced that the club has picked up former U.S. youth international Jared Jeffrey through a waiver draft conducted this afternoon. Per club and League policy, the terms of the deal were not disclosed. Jeffrey will join the Black-and-Red roster on July 9, pending receipt of his International Trasnfer Certificate. "We are pleased to add another quality young player to our squad in Jared Jeffrey," said D.C. United General Manager Dave Kasper. "He is a technically gifted midfielder who has solid experience at various U.S. Youth National Team levels and recently with Mainz. We look forward to his future contributions to our club." Most recently with German side Mainz of the Bundesliga, the 23-year-old made 87 total appearances (79 starts) with the club's reserve squad from 2010-13, notching four goals in the process. Parade Boys Soccer National High School Player of the Year in 2008, Jeffrey signed with Club Brugge (Belgium) at age 18. Jeffrey boasts a decorated youth international resume as well. During his three semesters in the U-17 Men's National Team Residency Program, Jeffrey led all players with 39 caps. A former captain of the U.S. U-17 Men's National Team for the 2007 U-17 FIFA World Cup, the Texas native also competed in the U-20s' three group stage matches for the U-20 FIFA World Cup in 2009. Appearing alongside the Black-and-Red's Bill Hamid and Perry Kitchen in the U.S. U-23's 2012 London Olympic Qualifying campaign, Jeffrey started two of those matches, a 6-0 win over Cuba and a 2-0 loss to Canada.	1
Illegals is NOT a race, it is a crime! Mexico: Puts their illegals in jail, and deports them. They only let people/citizens with secure and verify IDs vote in their country too. So not latinos from central America infiltrate their political system. Honduras: building a more secure border to prevent illegals and gangs from Salvador Israel: has a muslim wall, and they control their immigration. They even protect their religion fiercely there. Saudi Arabia: building a 700 mile long border wall to control illegals, and ISIS from their Iraq Border. They dont even let Christians be citizens there. Control their immigration tightly. They are not even taking any of their own cultural economic migrants/rapefugees. Hungary: Just built a 100 mile long better security border fence. That helped them keep their sovereignty, country, and prevent the insane suicide of Germany and Sweden. And they guard it: Every country has immigration laws. At least the ones not brainwashed into destroying themselves. Liberals have just forgotten, or been brainwashed into thinking America is no longer a country. But some Marxist globalist Disney movie bullshit. All by the cancer that is cultural marxism. Bill Clinton, and even globalist Obama deports Illegals. Millions of them. MILLIONS each. And so has every president for the last 60 years deported Illegals. Bush jr deported many millions. So did Bill Clinton. And even Obama is nearing 4 million deportations. He just does it on the downlow, and our liberal media does not make a big deal of it. It is following our LAWS. They are not invited guest. They are invaders. Even if they benefit. Liberal mentality is ruining western countries. They have been made to believe, America, and western countries, are no longer countries. But the legal mommy and daddy, and welfare state, to anybody that wants it. I am latino. Was a LEGAL immigrant. As any immigration should be. Legal process only. Or there is no more country. And liberals might as well call themselves traitors to America, and to Western Civilization. This guy is not "undocumented". He is a criminal. Yes, he benefitted. But so does every criminal that robs a store, or robs your house. They benefit too. Are they "undocumented" owners of the store, and your house when they rob it? Just because a criminal might be cute too, or have family, or get good grades, does NOT make them any less of a criminal when they break laws. In fact, it makes them more devious when they advertise it. Because they then only do it to sway opinion that their crime is no big deal. To convince useful idiots, that maybe its not even a crime. Also "undocumented" is just the new politically correct brainwashing word to manipulate baby minds. Call it what they are. ILLEGAL invaders. Mexico does not bullshit with its illegals like liberal baby minds do in USA. It puts them in jail, and deports them. They dont call them "undocumented". Just like the new Obama appointed moron at the Justice Department, that does not like calling criminals and felons criminals and felons, and wants to try a baby brainwashing word like "justice involved Besides, for every guy like this, there are 100 other illegals doing crime, selling drugs, and not giving any fuck about anything.	1
OTTAWA — The federal government is saying little about an apparent breach involving classified information - one that could snowball into a serious compromise of closely guarded secrets. Digital hacking collective Anonymous made good late Monday on a threat to release what it says is the first of many sensitive documents. It posted online what appeared to be a 2014 Treasury Board memo about funding of the Canadian Security Intelligence Service's overseas communications capabilities. But as of Tuesday morning, the document could not be accessed through the original link. It was disabled by Lunaweb Ltd., which runs upload site DocDroid, "because it seems to be leaked'' and DocDroid is "simply not the right place,'' said Lunaweb's Josias Montag. "Such documents should be published on WikiLeaks; they do have the resources and experts for such things." The Canadian Press could not confirm the document's authenticity and Jeremy Laurin, a spokesman for Public Safety Minister Steven Blaney, would not comment. Laurin said Tuesday that officials "continue to monitor this situation closely." One senior official said it was still unclear Tuesday as to whether the document, which appears to be genuine, was indeed pilfered by hackers, or simply leaked. "There are obviously concerns about the document being released, except there's no confirmation it has been obtained through a hacking," said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to comment publicly. Anonymous has carried out cyberattacks against governments, corporations and others in the name of free speech, Internet liberties and anti-capitalist causes. In a video statement discussing the document, Anonymous denounced the July 16 fatal shooting of a supporter in Dawson Creek, B.C., during a confrontation with the RCMP. Officers challenged and subsequently fired on the man, who was wearing a Guy Fawkes mask - an Anonymous trademark - outside a public hearing for a dam project to be built by BC Hydro. A knife was recovered from the scene. The man has been identified as 48-year-old James McIntyre. B.C.'s police watchdog, the Independent Investigations Office, is probing the death. The Anonymous video begins with a moment of silence for McIntyre, "our fallen friend." The shadowy, loosely knit collective is demanding the immediate arrest of the RCMP officers involved. "Unless and until that happens we will be releasing stunning secrets at irregular intervals." The video harshly criticizes the Harper government, police, security agencies and corporations, saying they have branded "anyone opposing their fossil-fuel agenda to be a terrorist." It also denounces "covert, warrantless surveillance" and the government's recently passed omnibus security bill, known as C-51. "Anonymous has been collecting bits of evidence and making plans for many months," the video says. The group seems to have selected the initial document for posting because - if authentic - it shows federal ministers made decisions over at least a four-year period to update security systems domestically and internationally. "Congratulations, you left many doors open for us," the video says. "We are now privy to many of Stephen Harper's cherished secrets.'' Anonymous has claimed responsibility for a June attack that shut down several federal sites and wreaked havoc with email - billing it as a protest against the federal security legislation that broadened CSIS's mandate, boosted information-sharing and expanded no-fly list powers. No personal information was compromised during the cyberattack, Blaney said at the time. Regardless, the federal official said Tuesday, there is obviously interest in "trying to identify these hackers, it goes without saying." "All the agencies involved in security ... we'd really like to be able to put an end to this." Last week Blaney's department announced $142 million in new digital security spending, which will fund initiatives including an RCMP investigative team to combat high-priority cybercrime.

In September 2009 we predicted that average 8GB DIMM prices (DDR2 and DDR3) would reach $565/stick by year end (with DDR3 being higher than DDR2) and at now we're seeing the reversal of fortunes for DDR2. At year end, the average price for benchmark DDR2/DDR3 was $591 retail, with promotional pricing pushing that below$550 as predicted. Today, we're seeing DDR3 begin to overtake DDR2 in the 8GB ECC category, dropping below $510/stick, while DDR2 climbs to $550/stick (promotional, on $625/stick retail.) In 4GB ECC configurations, DDR2 enjoys only a slight retail advantage (13%) while promotional pricing (likely due to inventory reduction initiatives) are providing a bit better value short term. However, the price gap is only 1/2 the power gap, with DDR3 delivering a greater than 35% reduction in power over its DDR2 equivalent (about $1.25/year/stick at $0.10/kWh). The honeymoon is almost over for DDR2. SOLORI's Take: With strong DDR3 demand and short-falls in DDR2 supply (according to DRAMeXchange), the only thing keeping DDR3 prices above DDR2 at this point is demand and inventory. As Q2/2010 introduces a rush of new workstation and server products based on DDR3 systems, the DRAM production ramp will eventually stabilize demand somewhere towards the end of Q3/2010. Meanwhile, technology companies like VMware, Microsoft, Intel and AMD are betting on new infrastructure spending on operating systems, virtualization and hardware refresh to drive-up economic market factors. If the global economic crisis deepens, this anticipated spending spree could be short-lived and its impact shallow.	1
For a place called Brooklyn Coffee Shop, there is quite an extensive food menu at this new Mills 50 spot. Also, for a place named after a New York borough, there's a lot of South American influences. Seattle, too. Also Miami. But that's all explained, at least partially, on the business's website. Owners Daniel and Patricia Carvalho lived in Seattle and New York but moved to Brazil, where, in 2010, they opened the first Brooklyn Coffee Shop as a paean to Seattle's favorite liquid and Brooklyn's neighborhood bistros. That location in Curitiba and a second one there continue, though its Facebook page makes a lot of references to Orlando. The Orlando BCS takes the space most recently occupied by Restaurant Ash, which was also the original Funky Monkey Wine Co. So there's a kitchen to be put to use. They fire it up in the morning for breakfast fare such as Shakshuka, house-made doughnuts and a variety of dishes with eggs, including empanadas. It continues through lunch with the morning menu available plus a variety of salads, sandwiches and other empanadas. It's clear that empanadas are a specialty, so I had the Pastel de Carne when I stopped in for a late lunch. It was filled with lots of shredded brisket, seasoned with garlic, onions and chili spicing. The turnover-like device had a wonderfully flaky crust, at least on the top. When I picked it up I found the bottom part quite moist. This apparently was from the fatty brisket, so it just added flavor. Lots and lots of flavor. It was even better when dipped in the mildly spicy chimichurri. I also had the Bauru sandwich. Bauru is a traditional Brazilian sandwich that is usually made with roast beef and melted cheese, typically mozzarella. For some reason -- perhaps in an attempt to Brooklynize it? -- here it is made with Canadian bacon and swiss cheese, unmelted, along with tomato and sliced pickles. What makes this odder is that the restaurant's website says this sandwich is made with brisket. And since we know that brisket is available for the making of empanadas, why Canadian bacon? Whatever. It was a very good sandwich, with plenty of meat, and a buttery taste in the toasted bread. I don't think it quite warranted the $8 fee, especially served solo. (The $3.50 charge for the empanada was fair.) And then there's the coffee. It's a bit strange that a place named Brooklyn would specify Americano as a choice. I'd think that would be the default. The beans are from Panther Coffee in Miami. This would have been a great chance to bring in the Seattle connection, or even the South American angle. My $2.50 cup of Americano, served in a Christmas themed mug, was only so-so. Little seems to have been done with the interior other than moving some furniture around. To wit, a hightop communal table that was near the front window is now in the back of the restaurant. The Edison lights that hung low over the table remain, below head level. Screws and hangers where photos and other accouterments of the previous occupant used to be are still in the walls. Some sprucing up may be in order. Brooklyn Coffee Shop is at 912 N. Mills Ave., Orlando. It is open for breakfast and lunch daily, with dinner hours to be announced soon. A brunch menu is served on Saturday and Sunday. The phone number is 407-704-1757	1

Chasing Pokemon has landed more than a dozen Hamilton kids in the emergency room since the popular game was launched in Canada July 18. Anthony Crocco, chief of pediatric emergency medicine at McMaster Children's Hospital, said the injuries have all been minor so far – bruises and sprained ankles – but some of them "could have been much worse." "What's really worrying here is the potential for kids to wander into traffic," he said. "We asked ourselves do we wait until someone gets hit by a car or do we speak up now?" The decision was for the hospital to issue a news release Thursday warning players, and their parents, to ensure the game is played safely. Pokemon Go is an "augmented reality" video game which uses the GPS capabilities of smartphones to superimpose fictional monsters over real locations. Players gather at those hotspots to lure creatures they capture and then pit against each other in virtual battles. It was created by Niantic Corp. Praised by some, including Crocco who said "anything that gets you off the sofa and outside and moving around is good," the game has also stirred a cloud of controversy over safety. On the safety side, a Toronto comic was recently fined for walking on TTC subway tracks while shooting a video about the game; in July police in Auburn NY, near Rochester, reported a man crashed his car while playing the game and police in the Belgian port city of Antwerp issued a warning about the potential dangers of pedestrians playing the game. An Alberta town has threatened a lawsuit against players crowding into the town. Crocco saw that danger in his own neighbourhood recently. While walking his dog one night he observed three teenagers of bicycles wheeling down the centre of the roadway, all with their eyes glued to their cellphones. "It was just luck that a car didn't come around the corner and knock them all over," he said. Only three days after the game was released in Canada Hamilton police received a report of a teenaged male cyclist who may have been "bumped" by a vehicle in the lower city Tuesday afternoon while focusing on his Pokemon hunt.	1
The bound T: Mul does not imply that the result of the binary operator is also of type T . The result type is an associated type of this trait: Output . The other issue is that at some point in time the operator traits switched from pass-by-referece to pass-by-value. In generic code this can be a bit of a pain in the butt (for now at least) because these operators consume their operands unless you also require the types to be Copy . Just for completeness (in case you don't like to require Copy ), let me add some information about a possible alternative direction. For the sake of generic code, authors of "numeric types" are encouraged to provide additional non-consuming implementations of these operator traits so that you don't need Copy or Clone . For example, the standard library already provides the following implementations: f64 implements Mul< f64> f64 implements Mul<&f64> &f64 implements Mul< f64> &f64 implements Mul<&f64> with each implementation having f64 as Output type. But making use of these traits directly is not pretty: fn cube<T>(x: &T) -> T where for<'a> T: Mul<&'a T, Output = T>, for<'a,'b> &'a T: Mul<&'b T, Output = T> { x * x * x } Eventually, we might get some (slightly) higher level traits, which would reduce the noise. For example: T: Mul2 could imply T: Mul<T> + Mul<&T> and &T: Mul<T> + Mul<&T> . But at the time of writing this, the Rust compiler does not seem able to handle this. At least I could not successfully compile the following code: use std::ops::Mul; pub trait Mul2 where Self: Mul<Self, Output=Self>, Self: for<'a> Mul<&'a Self, Output=Self>, for<'a> &'a Self: Mul<Self, Output=Self>, for<'a,'b> &'a Self: Mul<&'b Self, Output=Self> {} impl<T> Mul2 for T where T: Mul<T, Output=T>, T: for<'a> Mul<&'a T, Output=T>, for<'a> &'a T: Mul<T, Output=T>, for<'a,'b> &'a T: Mul<&'b T, Output=T> {} fn cube<T: Mul2>(x: &T) -> T { x * x * x } fn main() { let c = cube(&2.3); println!("Hello, world! {}", c) } I think it's safe to say that things will improve in this area. For now, the ability to generically implement numeric algorithms in Rust is not as good as I would like it to be.	1
15 ft. Glow Rod Set is rated 4.5 out of 5 by 13 . Rated 5 out of 5 by derekp from very useful As a homeowner doing a lot of re-wiring on our old house, I'm finding these very handy. I've never had much luck with steel fish tape. These are just the right amount flexible, and a good length. I personally haven't found the glow feature useful so far. The bullnose tip tends to come unscrewed, easy to lose it in the wall as I did. They don't sell replacements of those, apparently. I ended up drilling carefully through the end of one of the rods, which is working well. Rated 5 out of 5 by Coon from Klein Glow Rod Set As a veteran electrician, I have used various brands of glow rods from different companies and the ones that I have found to be the best are the ones made by Klein Tools. They are durable as well as flexable and hold up well on jobsites. They even come with a convient tube to be carried in from job site to jobsite. Rated 5 out of 5 by Sparky from Great set of rods. Pro electrician here These are great rods as with any of the Klein products. I am a professional commercial electrician and these hold up extremely well as well as some of my other Klein tools I have had for years. It is the industry standard. To the gentleman giving this product 2 stars, you do not run rods through a conduit you should run a flexible fiberglass snake or a metal snake provided no wires are in the conduit that may have power so shut power off before doing so and use wire lube. You sound like the type of person that should not be doing the work in the first place so don't rate a product low because you are going beyond the limitations of the product and using it for other than what it was designed for. Rated 2 out of 5 by Wile from glow rod This product worked as expected, but as some of the other reviewers mentioned one of the rods splintered on the first use. I would have expected that if I was trying to bend the sections too sharp or putting too much force on them, but in this case it was a fairly gentle bend and I was trying to be careful and not putting too much pressure on it. The other two sections still look brand new and it did the job as i mentioned. It was just a fair amount of money spent for something that only lasted one use. Rated 4 out of 5 by C7882 from The New Glorod If you have the older version the difference you will see is the that the newer version is a little thicker in diameter and also has the splinter guard feature. Rated 5 out of 5 by noonie from great Worked perfectly. Great design. Came with hook and round head with a hole for drag line. Rated 5 out of 5 by Aaron from Customer service is awesome !!!! Product is always good but the customer service here exceeded all expectations.	1
Philadelphia DA Seth Williams (left) has slammed Pa. AG Kathleen Kane Why did the AG drop a case that exposed Democratic corruption? Prosecutors almost never go to war against each other. But in Pennsylvania, Democratic attorney general Kathleen Kane is being brutally criticized by Seth Williams, Philadelphia's district attorney and a fellow Democrat. Williams is upset that last year one of Kane's first acts in office was to decline to prosecute four Philadelphia state legislators and other government officials. In a sting operation, all had been caught accepting cash or Tiffany jewelry in exchange for votes or favors. Kane, who is white, has defended herself, saying that the investigation was badly managed and tainted by racism. She claims the criticism comes from what she calls the "Good Ol' Boys Club." Williams, who is African American, has shot back: "I have seen racism. I know what it looks like. This isn't it." Advertisement Advertisement #ad#The sting operation followed pretty much the same playbook as the federal Abscam investigation of the 1970s. Begun in 2010, the Philly probe was conducted under Kane's three immediate predecessors as attorney general, and it resulted in more than 400 hours of video and audio recordings. Tyron B. Ali, a lobbyist originally from Trinidad, served as the undercover agent; after he was charged with fraud, he agreed to wear a wire in exchange for lenient treatment. Word of his cash offers eventually got around and prompted some elected officials to call him first. "Sources with knowledge of the sting said the investigation made financial pitches to both Republicans and Democrats, but only Democrats accepted the payments," the Philadelphia Inquirer reported last week. Attorney General Kane inherited the investigation when she took office in January 2013. She told the Inquirer that she stopped it without filing any charges because it was "poorly conceived, badly managed, and tainted by racism." She quoted Claude Thomas, the chief investigator in the case, as saying he had been ordered to target "only members of the General Assembly's Black Caucus" and to ignore "potentially illegal acts by white members." Advertisement In response, Williams issued an angry statement and penned an op-ed in Sunday's Inquirer. "The notion that they would target anyone based on race is ridiculous," Williams said in a statement. "I am confident they are not racist, and it is regrettable that the attorney general would casually throw around such an explosive accusation." Thomas, who is also African American, now works for Williams and denies he ever made such a statement. What is clear is just how damning some of the collected evidence is. The Inquirer reported this exchange between Ali, the lobbyist, and state representative Vanessa Brown: Ali went to Brown's office and handed her an envelope with $2,000, according to people who have reviewed a transcript of a tape Ali made on that day. As Brown accepted the money, they said, she put it in her purse and said: "Yo, good looking and Ooowee. . . . Thank you twice." After he gave Brown the money, Ali urged her to vote against a bill that would require voters to show identification at the polls, the sources said. Advertisement Kane's supporters say that federal law-enforcement officials she consulted believed the probe had suffered from a lack of "quality control" and could be viewed as entrapment. "Is the acceptance of cash alarming? Absolutely," one person close to Kane told the Inquirer. "But you've got to think: I've got to try this case." It certainly may have been politically awkward for Kane, as a Democrat, to prosecute only African-American defendants, but a conviction on something should have been a slam dunk. Even if prosecutors couldn't prove a quid pro quo, it is illegal for politicians to accept payments to enrich themselves and also illegal not to report the income. Further, the prosecutors in this case have a sterling track record in securing convictions against the leadership of both parties in the legislature, winning 21 convictions in the 2010 "Bonusgate" scandal, which involved illegal payments to legislative staffers who performed political work. All of those convicted were white. Kane has declined to answer detailed questions about why she dropped the investigation. Her critics, she says, are "playing political games to discredit me in order to fulfill their own selfish and improper agenda." When she met with Inquirer editors last Thursday, she brought her personal attorney and on his advice declined to answer any questions after the meeting. Her attorney says she may file a defamation suit against the paper, a ploy frequently used by public figures to intimidate journalists. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Williams says he is tired of Kane's "escalating excuses." He points out that when she took office, the files on the probe were with federal prosecutors who hadn't yet concluded whether they wanted to pursue their own case. "All she had to do was leave the investigation in the hands	1

DAMASCUS, Syria — During the second part of a lengthy interview with Al-Monitor in Damascus, a senior Syrian official said that the reality on the ground, the power balance and the military developments in the field were important, and in this regard, the Syrian authorities were content and reassured. The official, who requested anonymity, started by analyzing the Syrian map: "Each line extending from our southern border to Aleppo is under the control of Syrian troops. The militants received overwhelming blows in Homs and Qalamoun. Today in Aleppo, any military expert understands the meaning of controlling the central prison and the air force intelligence site in the city. Everybody recognizes that Aleppo is almost militarily fallen. Of course, cleansing it of militants and terrorists may need time. But the battle there, according to military battlefield logic, has already been decided and its results are clear." In response to claims that the regime's opponents have provided the government a great service with their behavior and mistakes, he smiled, saying, "This is absolutely true. Suffice it to mention two things: first, their collaboration with Israel and their openness to several contacts with it. That really helped us in our media battle in the Arab world. Second, and more importantly, the significant dominance by extremists and terrorist groups over those forces." Al-Monitor asked about allegations that the regime released fundamentalist prisoners to facilitate the formation of these groups. The Syrian official answered calmly: "It is true that a number of fundamentalists were released as a result of amnesty decrees for prisoners by the leadership in Syria during the years of strife. But the domination of extremist groups on the armed groups and their aspiration to control Syria preceded any act by us. Don't forget that the battle with these extremist groups began more than 30 years ago. It didn't break out in 2011. [It broke out] before the conflict [in our region] turned into open military battles. [Al-Qaeda leader] Ayman al-Zawahri was clear in his recorded message when he raised the slogan, 'The glory of the East starts in Damascus.' … "Of course, we worked through all media, political and diplomatic means, to expose the extremist danger on us and on all our surroundings and the world. This is part of our natural and legitimate response to the terrorist plot. You only need to read the message by Zawahri to an extremist group that he disagreed with, namely, the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS). He told them that one of the reasons why he disagreed with them is that they came out into the open. Al-Qaeda wanted to keep its battle secret until it was strong and could gain control. This is proof that the first way to fight them is to reveal their true image and highlight their presence and their danger, and that's what we did." The official continued, "It is important now that the war between them has become very fierce, especially after the split between their groups became an expression of the divide between the countries that were sponsoring and funding terrorists in Syria. One battle between two factions, ISIS and Jabhat al-Nusra, resulted in 1,400 people dead. Remarkably, in this area, they themselves have become aware of their own destiny and where they are headed. It is no coincidence in this context that Zawahri himself, in a message addressed to the battling rival extremist groups in the first week of April [2014], described some ISIS militants killing an Ahrar al-Sham official as a major crime. More importantly, Zawahri compared it to the incident where the Islamic Fighting Group in Algeria assassinated two other Islamic jihadists in 1995. Zawahri concluded, in his message, that what the Islamic Fighting Group did in Algeria that day was 'the moral death of those groups, which was followed by their material death.'" The Syrian official smiled at Zawahri's comparison of events in Algeria two decades ago to present-day Syria. The official said, "By making this comparison, al-Qaeda's leader wanted to threaten the terrorists beyond his control with death, as happened in Algeria. But he didn't pay attention, in that he expected the war in Syria to have a similar fate to their war in Algeria. The result there was that all terrorists and extremist groups were defeated and the state won and it is still in place to this day, and this is what will happen in Syria." What about the recent US escalation and Washington's willingness to boost military aid to the opposition? The Syrian official's face turned more serious. "A few weeks ago, we agreed with our allies in Russia that a high-level delegation from Moscow would visit Damascus. We were officially informed that the delegation will be headed by the Deputy Russian Foreign Minister Gennady Gatilov. But two weeks ago, officials in the Russian Embassy in Damascus surprised us by telling us that the date of the visit has been postponed for four days. We asked why. They told us it has to do with changes	1
John Clint Williamson has been named by the European Union mission in Kosovo as the chief prosecutor in a task force which has been set up to investigate the accusations against Hashim Thaci which date back to 1999. In a Council of Europe report released last year, Dick Marty, a Swiss MP, alleged that Mr Thaci and other rebel commanders of the Kosovo Liberation Army ran detention camps where civilian prisoners, most of them Serbs, were killed and their organs sold on the black market. The prime minister has denied the allegations, describing them as a plot being orchestrated against Kosovo, and says he is ready to cooperate with any investigation. He said the accusations were slanderous lies and had besmirched the reputation of the entire nation, which declared independence from Serbia in 2008. Mr Williamson was the head of Kosovo's Justice Department in 2001-2002 when the territory was under the administration of the United Nations. He then served as US Ambassador-at-large for war crimes issues. The American prosecutor has also been tasked with investigating claims that some of Kosovo's most senior leaders run a criminal network dealing in drugs. The claims of a trade in human organs were first made public in a book, 'The Hunt', by Carla del Ponte, former UN war crimes prosecutor for the former Yugoslavia, who claimed hundreds of Serb civilians died in camps ran by the KLA in the north of neighbouring Albania. So far, both the UN and EU have maintained that their investigations into the alleged organ harvesting have failed to yield any evidence. But pressure from Serbia and its ally Russia for a full investigation has brought the issue to international attention.	1
This WSJ article about economists in search of a model takes it as given that all our models have failed completely in the crisis — which is a gross exaggeration. It's true that if you bought completely into rational-expectations macroeconomics, the crisis in the economy should be causing a crisis in your faith — although as far as I can tell, the freshwater types remain smugly convinced of their rightness. But those of us who hadn't forgotten Keynes, who paid attention to things like Japan's lost decade and developing-country financial crises, aren't feeling all that at sea. More specifically, we knew all about liquidity traps, and had at least thought about balance-sheet crises, a decade ago. Remember, I wrote the first edition of The Return of Depression Economics in 1999. The world we're now in isn't that different from the world I suspected, back then, we'd find ourselves in.	1
Despite releasing some very capable hardware this year, LG's mobile division hasn't been performing particularly well lately. Although the V20 looks to be off to a strong start in the US, the launch of the G5 earlier in the year saw a 23 percent drop in mobile sales in the previous quarter, which is pretty much a full blown disaster for a flagship manufacturer. To help steer LG's various divisions to brighter horizons, the company is appointing CEO Jo Seong-jin to head up the business. LG announced a management reshuffle on Thursday, in which the company eliminated its triple-CEO structure and promoted Jo as sole CEO of LG Electronics. Jo had previously headed up LG's home and appliance unit since 2013 and oversaw a 25 percent boost to the company's operating profit last year. Despite the reshuffle, LG Electronics' mobile chief Cho Juno will retain his position into next year. "LG Electronics decided to name Jo as our new sole CEO in recognition for his charismatic decision-making in recent years to launch innovative new products, and his performance has been proven in quarterly earnings," – LG Electronics official. The reshuffle comes after LG's mobile division reported an operating loss in six consecutive quarters, since Q2 2015. Although much of the focus has been on LG's flagship G5 and V20 releases this year, the company's strategy for the lower end market hasn't been working out either. Budget smartphone launches in the US have failed to grab a significant market share and has ended up worsening the division's profitability at a time when the G5 also posted weak sales. LG clearly needs to try something a little different next year, and the G6 flagship is rumored to be packing in plenty of bells and whistles.	1

Here is a sample which I have forgotten to delete - - hi XXX, more than 90% of women referred to a breast clinic do not have breast cancer-- so dont go into depression. breast cancer usually causes no pain in the breast and you have been having pain for 10 years. .. many women have breast swelling and tenderness in the week or two before their periods.    most breast lumps are caused by hormonal changes that during the menstrual cycle when a woman gets her monthly period--- changing estrogen and progesterone hormone levels pain is usually most obvious in the week before your period.   it quickly goes when your period starts.   it is more common in women aged 30-50. in most cases, a benign (non-cancerous) breast lump needs no treatment unless it is particularly large or painful. . . in some types of lump, such as a cyst or abscess, there can be fluid that may need draining  . antibiotics alone cannot adequately treat an abscess. . . a lump caused by infection is fairly common in women who are breast-feeding.    the ducts that carry the breast milk can become blocked.    bacteria can enter through cracks in the nipple.    this can lead to the development of an abscess in the breast.   inflammation of the lactating breast tissue is known as mastitis. a lipoma is a fatty growth that develops within the fatty tissue of your breast.    it is non-cancerous and usually does not need any treatment.   however, they can be removed if they are large . .. a mammogram is essentially an X-ray of your breasts.. each breast is compressed between two X-ray plates.   .. this may feel a little uncomfortable but the discomfort should only last for a few minutes. . a mammogram is estimated to be able to detect about 90% of breast cancers. a doctor inspects any suspicious skin changes that may be a sign of breast cancer.  .. . ultrasound is useful in the evaluation of breast lumps.  . .It can distinguish between a cyst (such as a benign cyst, which is filled with fluid) and a solid lump (which may or may not be cancerous) . .. the first step in the evaluation of a breast lump is to determine whether it is a cyst or solid mass. MRI is performed if results of mammography and ultrasound evaluations are not conclusive. MRI cannot detect the presence of calcium deposits, which can be identified by mammography and may be a sign of cancer. .. A lipoma is a benign tumor of the breast composed of normal fat cells. Typically, a lipoma grows slowly and does not require surgical removal. Once the diagnosis of lipoma is confirmed careful observation is usually all that is required. Breast lipoma is a soft, smooth mass in the breast that is somewhat firm to the touch. there only one way to be certain that a lump is not cancerous is to have a tissue sampling (biopsy) . .

With the help of celebrities and professional activists, protests of the Dakota Access Pipeline in North Dakota have attracted international attention. The shouting and violence have drawn sympathy from people who are hearing only one side of the story — the one told by activists. Were the full story to be heard, much, if not all, of that sympathy would vanish. The activists tell an emotionally charged tale of greed, racism and misbehavior by corporate and government officials. But the real story of the Dakota Access Pipeline was revealed in court documents in September, and it is nothing like the activists' tale. In fact, it is the complete opposite. The record shows that Energy Transfer Partners, the company building the pipeline, spent years working diligently with federal, state and local officials to route the pipeline safely and with the fewest possible disruptions. The contrast between the protesters' claims and the facts on record is stunning.

Protesters claim that the pipeline was "fast-tracked," denying tribal leaders the opportunity to participate in the process. In fact, project leaders participated in 559 meetings with community leaders, local officials and organizations to listen to concerns and fine-tune the route. The company asked for, and received, a tougher federal permitting process at sites along the Missouri River. This more difficult procedure included a mandated review of each water crossing's potential effect on historical artifacts and locations. Protesters claim that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers failed to consult tribal leaders as required by federal law. The record shows that the corps held 389 meetings with 55 tribes. Corps officials met numerous times with leaders of the Standing Rock Sioux tribe, which initiated the lawsuit and the protests. Protesters claim that the Standing Rock Sioux pursued meetings with an unresponsive Army Corps of Engineers. Court records show that the roles in that story were in fact reversed. The corps alerted the tribe to the pipeline permit application in the fall of 2014 and repeatedly requested comments from and meetings with tribal leaders only to be rebuffed over and over. Tribal leaders ignored requests for comment and canceled meetings multiple times. In September 2014 alone, the corps made five unsuccessful attempts to meet with Standing Rock Sioux leaders. The next month, a meeting was arranged, but "when the Corps timely arrived for the meeting, Tribal Chairman David Archambault told them that the conclave had started earlier than planned and had already ended," according to a federal judge. At a planned meeting the next month, the tribe took the pipeline off the agenda and refused to discuss it. This stonewalling by tribal leaders continued for a year and a half. Typical of the misinformation spread during the protests is a comment made by Jesse Jackson, who recently joined the activists in North Dakota. He said the decision to reroute the pipeline so that it crossed close to the Standing Rock Sioux tribe's water intake was "racism." He did not mention, possibly because he did not know, that the company is paying to relocate the tribe's water intake to a new spot 70 miles from the location of the contested pipeline crossing. The pipeline route was adjusted based on concerns expressed by locals — including other tribal leaders — who met with company and Army Corps of Engineers officials. The court record reveals that the Standing Rock Sioux refused to meet with corps officials to discuss the route until after site work had begun. That work is now 77 percent completed at a cost of $3 billion. In response to a lawsuit filed by the Standing Rock Sioux, the court documented "	1

By Emman Ovuakporie and Johnbosco Agbakwuru ABUJA-BARELY 24hours after former President Olusegun Obasanjo lampooned the President Muhammadu Buhari All Progressives Congress, APC led government,Spokesman of the House of Representatives, Abdulrazaq Namdas on Thursday took a swipe at the former president describing him as the grand father of corruption in Nigeria. He also alleged at a press briefing held at the NASS complex that Obasanjo has the intention of bringing down President Muhammadu Buhari's government. Namdas who read a prepared statement said:"Our attention has been drawn to a statement credited to former President Olusegun Obasanjo at a lecture he delivered recently, wherein, in his characteristic manner accused everybody but himself of corruption. " He ventured to accuse the National Assembly of Budget padding, accused the House of criminal activities of threatening the life of a "whistleblower", lampooned constituency projects which he approved as President, ventured to discuss the budget of National Assembly which is highly underfunded? " The House of Representatives would ordinarily not join issues with the former President as he has held an office that deserves respect and reverence. "However, because of the material mis-statement of facts, outright lies and falsehoods, and mischievous innuendo introduced in his statement, we are left with no option but to correct him. " We have repeatedly maintained that there was no "padding" of the 2016 Appropriation Act, which is a legitimate document passed by the National Assembly, authenticated by the Clerk to the National Assembly as provided in the Acts Authentication Act and assented to by Mr. President. " It is most unfortunate that a former President of Chief Obasanjo's stature would allow himself to be hoodwinked and procured by a renegade member of the House, who embarked on massive propaganda and lies just because he was removed from office. For the avoidance of doubt, there is no crime that was committed by the National Assembly by exercising its constitutional function of appropriation. "If Chief Obasanjo has an issue with the execution of the 2016 Budget or indeed other Appropriation Acts, he should direct his anger elsewhere. "He claimed that the National Assembly Budget is very high, when by all standards, the National Assembly is grossly underfunded and is hampered from effectively and legitimately carrying out its Constitutionally assigned functions. The National Assembly Budget funds a bureaucracy of about 5,000 civil servants. " It has some other agencies under its preview such as the National Assembly Service Commission with its own staff of about 500, even the Public Complaints Commission is now a parastatal of the National Assembly. National Assembly Budget also funds the National Institute for Legislative Studies, which is a legislative think-tank and highly rated academic institution that serves both National and State Houses of Assembly and even international legislators. " All these agencies also have their capital budget including development of their headquarters, procurement of office equipment, procurement of regular items for running their offices; the National Assembly maintain legislative aides of about 3,000 in number, that aid the work of the Assembly; it also conducts regular public hearings involving the media and stakeholders and oversight activities, involving huge sums of money. "The cost implications of running the National Assembly is high because of the nature of our Presidential democracy. Then of course, there are 109 Senators and 360 members of the House of Representatives, that require proper equipment to function effectively. " They require adequate travel and transport support to carry out legislative functions. The National Assembly also has buildings and offices to build and maintain. "National Assembly staff and members attend conferences, trainings, seminars to keep abreast of legislative developments worldwide. The activities are very encompassing and expensive. " It is also unbecoming of a former President to quote figures of sums of money that are factually incorrect. No member of the House of Representatives receives N10m every month. The salaries and allowances of members of the House are as determined by the Revenue Mobilisation Allocation and Fiscal Commission (RMAFC). " Of course further sums of money are spent as running costs, that is, the cost of running the office of a member. If a Minister, Chief Executive or Director in a Ministry travels on official duties, for instance, do you include the cost of his ticket and accommodation as part of his salary or allowances? Does the cost of stationery and maintenance of equipment like computers used in their offices, form part of their salaries and allowances? These are some of the costs that must be taken care of by the National Assembly and the media calls these costs "jumbo pay". "For goodness sake, the National Assembly is an arm of government, not just an ordinary agency of government. "The Budget of many agencies in the Executive Branch are indeed higher than the current Budget of the National	1
Heroes of Antarctic exploration-past famously include Shackleton, Scott, and Amundsen who raced to the South Pole in search of fame and discovery. They encountered harsh conditions and suffered extreme hardships, cut off from communication with the outside world. It took years of planning, then years of recovery, for these explorers to even begin to understand what they went through – let alone to describe what they discovered. Over one hundred years later, filled with probably just as much excitement and anticipation, a new group of explorers has again journeyed to Antarctica. After years of planning, the Antarctic Peninsula Paleontology Project, or AP3, an international team of scientists, of which I am a part, headed off to probe a new frontier of Antarctic exploration. Our mission was not to discover the South Pole, but to find evidence of ancient life on a continent largely void of anything alive today. Would we really get there? Could I carry my own weight? Was my mom justified in worrying like I was her six-year-old daughter, not a 36-year-old professional paleontologist? These questions, among others ran through my mind, as I got ready to join 11 other paleontologists for this extreme fieldwork experience.  Facebook Twitter Pinterest Taking the Zodiac to the shore from the Nathaniel B. Palmer icebreaker ship Photograph: Kerin Claeson This amazing journey was made possible thanks to a merger of science and technology, of geologists and paleontologists, pilots and professors, seafarers and students, of Mother Nature and Deep Time. With the generous support of the National Science Foundation's Office of Polar Programs, the AP3 was able to venture to the Antarctic to answer questions about life near the end of the Age of Dinosaurs. As the name of our project indicates, we targeted a region of Antarctica known as the Antarctic Peninsula, specifically the islands within the James Ross Island Group.  These islands were once covered by ocean, when non-avian dinosaurs roamed the land, giant marine reptiles swam the seas, and swarms of strange fish schooled along the shores. We know the Antarctic Peninsula was warmer back then, teeming with plant and animal life, yet we know so little about the species that lived there. Therefore, we sought to travel to Antarctica ourselves, to collect data to answer questions about the extinct ecosystems that inhabited the continent during the Late Cretaceous and Early Paleogene. Actually getting there was among the first of the many significant hurdles that the AP3 team would eventually overcome. Unlike Shackleton, who met with unexpectedly formidable sea ice and was to surrender his vessel to a frozen horizon, the AP3 was fully informed of the ice conditions on and around the Peninsula. In 2013 and 2014, there were near record amounts of sea ice surrounding the James Ross Island Group. Those would have been the first two years of our AP3 expedition, supported by the US Antarctic Program research vessel Laurence M. Gould. Warned in advance, however, we knew we were going nowhere and cancelled those field seasons. Fast-forward through two years and lots of negotiations, and we were ready to defy the sea ice via passage on the Nathaniel B. Palmer (NBP), a larger ice-breaking vessel equipped with small boat and helicopter support.  Facebook Twitter Pinterest The team's campsite in Antarctica Photograph: Kerin Claeson Then (wouldn't you guess it?) 2016 was among the warmest austral summers on record, with little sea ice and extensive exposure of potentially fossil-bearing rock. So, it took AP3 only four years of patient preparation, two days of flights to reach Chile, five days of polar field-camp and preparedness training, and four days of cruising through the Straits of Magellan, Drake Passage, and Weddell Sea before we took a short Zodiac ride to the shore of Vega Island on February 13, 2016. We had made it, and we were ready to science day and night for the next five weeks, on and off the shores of the islands in the James Ross group. Of course we were not done facing the elements: water, earth, wind, but no fire (no wood means no campfires and no marshmallows!). By water, I mostly mean the frozen sort. We were not permitted to traverse over ice, much to the dismay of all my friends and family who honestly hoped we would be the team to actually uncover The Thing. No, we were intent on prospecting and digging for fossils, so regardless of potential safety issues, we simply avoided travel over glaciers. We stuck to exposed rock and soil surfaces, of which there were many, and fortunately for the AP3, most of these areas were filled with fossils peeking out of the earth.

Please enable Javascript to watch this video BALLWIN, MO (KTVI) – St. Louis County is unveiling its new radio system for first responders this week. Tax dollars from a special sales tax will pay for $66.4 million dollars of equipment. It will connect police, fire and emergency medical crews on special radio channels when multiple agencies are needed for a natural or manmade emergency. St. Louis County Public Safety Supervisor Daniel Davis said surrounding counties are in the process of joining the communication effort. The terror attack on September 11, 2001 magnified the old system's shortcomings. "We didn't have the capability for police, fire and medical to talk to one another," Davis explained. "Now we can supply a radio channel for a particular incident or a tornado. Everybody can speak with one another to give optimal service in the area where it's required." The unified system should reduce the time it takes for commanders on the scene to reach first responders when additional help is needed. A new emergency operations center is now open and the county's outdoor tornado siren system has been upgraded thanks to the special emergency communications sales tax that was approved by voters in 2009. The operations center includes a new 911 answering and police dispatch facility that is large enough to accommodate countywide dispatching service if that is needed. Forty agencies contract with St. Louis County for dispatching service. Nineteen other 911 answering centers exist in St. Louis County. Municipal police departments own and operate the other centers. Some of them offer service to smaller police departments under a contract. St. Louis County provided the upgraded radio equipment to each of those centers. But each 911 center has its own computer dispatching system. Emergency 911 calls made with cell phones can also produce varying results. "There are still many cell phones out there using older technology. Those cell phone companies are not able to provide us with exact coordinate information for where the call is originating from," Davis said. Cell phone users need to give dispatchers their precise location to insure first responders can find them. St. Louis County is in the process of upgrading the 911 system but cell phone owners and their service providers must also improve their technology. "The next generation 911 will certainly allow us a little better ability to pinpoint cell phone users and as everybody upgrades their cell phones and the older technology phones go by the wayside then we'll certainly be able to do a better job pinpointing where they are calling from," said Davis.	1
BORDEAUX, France (Reuters) - At a rally on Alain Juppe's home ground in Bordeaux last week, a group of supporters tried to get the crowd clapping and chanting before the conservative presidential hopeful took to the stage. They failed. French politician Alain Juppe, current mayor of Bordeaux, a member of the conservative Les Republicains political party and candidate for the centre-right presidential primary, attends a political rally as he campaigns in Bordeaux, France, November 9, 2016. REUTERS/Regis Duvignau And during the meeting, there was nothing to match the electric atmosphere at rallies for former president Nicolas Sarkozy, Juppe's rival to be the French conservatives' candidate in next year's presidential election. The scene in the town where Juppe has been mayor for most of the past 20 years showed the challenge he faces ahead of Sunday's voting for the Republican party nomination: Can he fire up enough voters to back him? The former prime minister, 71, has been ahead in opinion polls for months, seen as a safe bet in a primary election whose winner has a good chance of becoming president next year. But the race is tightening in its final days, with one poll showing Juppe losing to another former prime minister, Francois Fillon, who has unexpectedly gained momentum. Even if Juppe does win the primaries, his path to the Elysee Palace is complicated by Wednesday's announcement by Socialist President Francois Hollande's former economy minister Emmanuel Macron that he will run for president. Macron, 38, is popular among centrists and could take votes from Juppe in the presidential election. Polls show the bigger the turnout the better are Juppe's chances in the primaries. Party managers are working furiously to get the vote out. "What matters is not how loud the crowd is but who turns up to vote," said Gilles Boyer, Juppe's campaign director.

REUTERS/Regis Duvignau "It's time to engage everyone!" Juppe told supporters in Paris. But Donald Trump's surprise U.S. election win against Hillary Clinton, a candidate in many ways similar to Juppe, has given hope to the French politician's opponents, amid fears that polling is failing to give the full picture. Anybody can take part in the conservative primaries, making it hard to identify who will vote and who will win. "That was the case in the United States and is also a problem for pollsters for the primaries," said Sciences Po Bordeaux university professor Jean Petaux. "We must take opinion polls with a big pinch of salt." What could help Juppe is the fact that many voters don't much like the alternatives. "He's a good mayor and I like what he did in Bordeaux," said local resident Maryline Coudouin. "But I have a bit of an issue with his age." She was however likely to back Juppe "for lack of any other option". AUSTERE IMAGE In an effort to shed his austere image, Juppe has allowed himself to be photographed dancing with pensioners at a retirement home and has gone on television to confess to numerous affairs between his two marriages. In an autobiography published in September he recalled a childhood dream of growing up to be the pope. Slideshow (4 Images) Under Juppe, a refurbished Bordeaux has attracted tourists and new residents. Old buildings have been cleaned up, a tram network built and the Garonne river quays opened to the public. He has worked with local left-wing mayors and promoted inter-faith dialogue, which differentiated him from Sarkozy, who has mocked Juppe's political alliances and taken a hard line on Islam. The two candidates' economic policies are largely similar — cutting public spending and scrapping a tax on the wealthy. But aides say that, unlike Sarkozy, Juppe can unite people across party lines. "He is shy and not much of an extrovert and doesn't much like to talk about himself," Virginie Calmels, Juppe's deputy in Bordeaux, said in an interview. "But he is a statesman, he is pragmatic and he brings people together." Juppe's long political history has come under scrutiny in this latest campaign. He has been seen as cold and rigid, especially since his time as prime minister in 1995-1997, when he faced weeks of strikes over pension reform. But he seemed	1
The chase to corral two runaway capybaras in a Toronto park had, by last week, seen strategy after strategy falter and fall by the wayside. First, searchers tried to blitz the animals, sending more than 30 High Park staffers out in hot pursuit. Then they tried to lure them back to their zoo pen with corn. Then they tried to catch them with a net, and almost snared one of them in a coyote trap, which proved too small. And then they finally found something that worked: Blocking cars and people from an area where one of the capybaras was known to lurk, deploying a larger cage out in the open, and watching patiently as they waltzed inside, as one did Sunday evening. Now — with that rodent back at the zoo, recovering from its ordeal — the searchers have to do it again. "(The second) one's going to be posing its own challenges," said Ben Lovatt, a local museum owner who has participated extensively in the chase, along with park staff and rescuers from the Toronto Wildlife Centre. "We're giving it some time. This one's going to require a lot more study and observation before people actually go in." The first capybara was retrieved Sunday evening in the park's southeast corner, near the drainage area of a pond, where passersby had spotted them in the days before the rescue. It came nearly three weeks after the animals — new arrivals to the High Park Zoo from a breeding program in Texas — absconded from their pen and disappeared into the park's array of trees, trails and creeks. The search party, since then, has relied heavily on reported sightings, and on the help of Lovatt and a few other private citizens, who have spent dozens of hours in recent weeks tracking the animals' movements and behaviour. That reconnaissance led to the first capture, said Megan Price, a spokeswoman for Toronto Parks, Forestry and Recreation. In a game of wits, they don't plan to stray from what has worked. "The second plan is the same as the first plan: To narrow down, through sightings, the area that it might be located, and then to spend a couple of days looking at its patterns and its habits and where it is, so that we can really situate the traps in the best possible locations," Price said. "We've had a couple of credible sightings. We're following those up," she added, declining to specify exactly where the second rodent has been seen. Rescuers aren't sure which capybara they captured Sunday, and which one remains loose. One is male and the other female, but both are around six months old. Due to their youth, Price said, the veterinarian who examined the captured animal "wasn't able to ascertain the gender." Regardless, the rodent was deemed healthy, save for a few minor scratches. The fundamentals, meanwhile, are in place to make the second apprehension. Once sightings of the second animal become fixed in one area of the park, staff will block off nearby roads and paths, as they did on the weekend. "It was great that they were able to cordon off the area and keep people back and keep people away," said Nathalie Karvonen, the executive director of the Toronto Wildlife Centre, whose cage made the ensnarement. "If there had been 30 people standing there, staring at the trap, (the capybara) would never have gone in." For now, the cat-and-mouse saga continues. Price said more than 20 staffers are stationed across High Park every day, performing their regular duties and watching, hopefully, for any flicker of fur in the distance. The public is also encouraged to stay vigilant. "When you're working with an animal, it's a dynamic environment," Lovatt said. "You kind of have to see how things go as they go." Price agreed, noting that the city has no projected or hopeful timeline for the second capture. "You should probably ask the capybara that," she said.	1
Getty Images The teams picking at the top of drafts are always hoping for immediate impact. But for teams deeper in the order, patience is a necessity, especially with a growing sense that players entering the NFL aren't as ready as they used to be. Whether it's because of increased early entrants or the systems college teams are running, more and more teams end up drafting players who can't be immediately useful. Panthers General Manager Dave Gettleman invoked former 49ers coach Bill Walsh saying he had a "two-year rule" to see if a player had a future with the team, but said it now has to be a three-year process. "We're not getting instant oatmeal anymore," Gettleman said. "And you've got to understand there's going to be growing pains. Nothing's easy. A guy can have all the talent in the world. But this game is about fundamentals and when we're getting them they don't have it. So our coaches have to really coach and teach, and it takes longer." Gettleman illustrated his willingness to take the long view last year, drafting linebacker Shaq Thompson with the 25th pick, choosing a guy who might eventually replace Thomas Davis. Thompson started 10 games but played a fairly limited role for the Panthers this year (only 34.3 percent of their defensive snaps), as they try to get the college utility player ready to contribute more. And the guy Gettleman might have preferred to Thompson also illustrates that principle. The Panthers would have taken Florida offensive tackle D.J. Humphries, but the Cardinals chose him a pick before. Humphries wasn't ready to win a starting job out of training camp, and was inactive for all 16 games this season. "We drafted D.J. last year knowing we were going to redshirt him because we had so much to teach him," Cardinals coach Bruce Arians said. "If he threw him out there, he was going to fail. Once they fail, it's hard to get those scars off. He didn't dress a game purposefully just to get better and better." For teams like the Panthers and Cardinals which have had success recently, it's easier to give a guy time to learn, since the staffs have a sense of security that allows development. Bad teams with coaches under pressure don't have the luxury. It also takes a roster talented enough that rookies aren't forced into situations they're not ready for.	1

"If the position I'm taking — which is that we need a lot more information — is rocking the boat," he said, "then I'm going to be rocking the boat." Much of the attention surrounding Qatar has focused on its climate. It is hot in the Middle East . In the summer, temperatures can routinely reach 130 degrees. Even if the stadiums use advanced cooling technology — promised by the Qataris in their bid, but still untested — it is not a stretch to think there will be issues. No one disputes this. Photo But that does not mean there are not other considerations. Gulati divides the concerns into four categories: how a change affects participants, including players, officials and fans; how it affects FIFA's economics (as it relates, for example, to television agreements); how it affects FIFA constituents, like the various domestic leagues and club teams around the world; and how it affects the Qatari organizing committee, which ostensibly bid on a summer World Cup. All of these factors are significant. Some observers have speculated that a change in dates could lead various entities — including the countries that lost out on the bid to host the 2022 World Cup — to seek legal action. Corporate partners with FIFA might take similar paths, opening the organization to serious liability. Would the Qatari organizers indemnify FIFA against potential legal problems? "We don't know anything about that," Gulati said. "But obviously that is important to know." Many of the European leagues have come out against a move to winter because of the havoc it would cause with league schedules. The United States would not have that issue ( Major League Soccer 's season runs from spring to fall), but that does not mean there would not be conflicts with a switch to a tournament in November. In just one example, Fox and Telemundo bid about $1 billion to broadcast the World Cup in the United States in 2018 and 2022. The expectation was that those tournaments would be played in the summer.

"How does a move affect us trying to promote the game if we're up against the N.F.L. or college football now? That's a reality we have to consider. And it's just one of a hundred things like that which need to be considered." Blatter and Platini, among others, seem to feel otherwise. Platini has taken public digs at the English officials questioning the logistics of a switch, chirping that "we respect your calendar for 150 years — for one month in 150 years you can change." Blatter appears uninterested in dissenting opinions, noting in an interview with the Web site Inside World Football that his organization is "the owner of the FIFA World Cup" and adding that he thinks "it is high time that Europe starts to understand that we do not rule the world anymore." At this point, it seems all but certain that the World Cup will be staged in Qatar. A change in nations is unlikely, and while there are human rights concerns with Qatar — just as there are with the 2014 Olympics and the 2018 World Cup in Russia — that is not the main problem of the moment. Gulati, who was part of the failed bid from the United States to host in 2022, acknowledged that losing to Qatar stung. "It was a significant setback, personally and professionally and for our federation," he said. Still, he said he was not interested in looking back. "I am in a different role now," he said. "There is a different question now." Advertisement Continue reading the main story That question is simply when. Summer or winter? Winter or summer? It is a switch that makes all the difference, and that is why Gulati wants a little more time. Not years, he said. Maybe just a few months. A few months for a tournament that isn't for nine years. Even coming from FIFA's loudest critics, that hardly sounds unreasonable.	1
Spare us any more hooey about "preventing fraud" and "protecting the integrity of the ballot box." The Republican-led crusade for voter ID laws has been revealed as a cynical ploy to disenfranchise as many likely Democratic voters as possible, with poor people and minorities the main targets. Recent developments in Pennsylvania — one of more than a dozen states where voting rights are under siege — should be enough to erase any lingering doubt: The GOP is trying to pull off an unconscionable crime. Late last month, the majority leader of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives, Mike Turzai, was addressing a meeting of the Republican State Committee. He must have felt at ease among friends because he spoke a bit too frankly. Ticking off a list of recent accomplishments by the GOP-controlled Legislature, he mentioned the new law forcing voters to show a photo ID at the polls. Said Turzai, with more than a hint of triumph: "Voter ID, which is gonna allow Governor Romney to win the state of Pennsylvania — done." That's not even slightly ambiguous. The Democratic presidential candidate has won Pennsylvania in every election since 1992. But now the top Republican in the Pennsylvania House is boasting that, because of the new voter ID law, Mitt Romney will defy history and capture the state's 20 electoral votes in November. Why on earth would Turzai imagine such a result? After all, the law applies to all voters, regardless of party affiliation. It is ostensibly meant only to safeguard the electoral process and eliminate fraud. Why would a neutral law have such partisan impact? Thanks to figures released last week by state officials, we know the answer. It turns out that 758,939 registered Pennsylvania voters do not have the most easily obtained and widely used photo ID, a state driver's license. That's an incredible 9.2 percent of the registered electorate. Most of the voters without driver's licenses live in urban areas — which just happen to be places where poor people and minorities tend to live. More than 185,000 of these voters without licenses, about one-fourth of the total, live in Philadelphia — which just happens to be a Democratic stronghold where African Americans are a plurality. Could suppressing the urban minority vote really give Pennsylvania to Romney? It probably wouldn't have made a difference in 2008, when Obama trounced John McCain handily. But the statewide contest is often much closer — and turnout in Philadelphia typically is key to a Democratic candidate's prospects. In 2004, for example, John Kerry's margin over George W. Bush in the state was a mere 144,248. Perhaps these numbers are so intoxicating that Turzai forgot the cover story about how voter ID is supposed to protect the franchise rather than selectively restrict it. His spokesman later explained that Turzai meant "the Republican presidential candidate will be on a more even keel thanks to voter ID" — in other words, there will be a level playing field once the new law eliminates all that pesky voter fraud. That might be reasonable, except for one fact: There's no fraud to eliminate. Prodded by GOP political activists, the Justice Department under Bush conducted an extensive, nationwide, five-year probe of voter fraud — and ended up convicting a grand total of 86 individuals, according to a 2007 New York Times report. Most of the cases involved felons or immigrants who may not have known they were ineligible to vote. Not one case involved the only kind of fraud that voter ID could theoretically prevent: impersonation of a registered voter by someone else. Pennsylvania and other voter ID states have, in essence, passed laws that will be highly effective in eradicating unicorns. The Pennsylvania law and others like it are under attack in the courts; this week, a federal three-judge panel in Washington is hearing arguments on Texas's year-old law, with a ruling expected next month. Meanwhile, Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder, a conservative Republican, broke with orthodoxy last week and vetoed bills that would have toughened an existing voter ID statute. Maybe the tide is turning. If it doesn't, these laws will potentially disenfranchise or discourage millions of qualified voters. In a previous column, I wrote that voter ID was a solution in search of a problem. I was wrong: The problem seems to be that too many of the wrong kind of voters — low-income, urban, African American, Hispanic — are showing up at the polls. Republican candidates have been vowing to "take back" the country. Now we know how. eugenerobinson@washpost.com	1
Amazon wants to build more distribution space in Romulus, and the state will vote Tuesday on whether it should support it with $5 million in tax incentives. The facility will cost $140 million. "(Amazon) plans to construct a new state-of-the-art fulfillment center in the City of Romulus, make investments and create jobs related to general warehousing and storage," according to background material for the Michigan Strategic Fund meeting in Lansing. The online retail giant is considering property in Romulus for the facility. An exact location was not immediately available, though it is in the Aerotropolis boundaries along the I-94 and I-275 corridors. The move would create 1,600 new jobs, according to the state memo. "In order to make the operation move at the level of efficiency necessary, there are substantial road and other infrastructure improvements needed," according to the MSF memo. "Providing this performance based incentive will help the Company offset some of the costs related to infrastructure improvements. In addition, Wayne County Aerotropolis is evaluating establishing an LDFA to capture state and local taxes to assist with infrastructure improvements." This is the second tax incentive request by Amazon in the past year for property in Wayne County. In December 2016, it was awarded a $7.5 million Michigan Business Development Program performance based grant for the creation of 1,000 jobs in Livonia. None of that money has been disbursed, since the facility is under construction. The Livonia facility is 1 million square feet, according to city records. That property will open later this year, and it represented one of the largest job creation announcements by the state in 2016. Amazon employs about 250 in a Detroit tech office, at Brilliance Audio in Grand Haven - where employees record audio books, among other things - and at a 210,000-square-foot sortation center in Brownstown Township, southwest of Detroit. Amazon [NASDAQ: AMZN] stock traded at $998 per share on Monday, giving the company a value of $477 billion, based on outstanding shares. The company employs about 200,000 globally.	1
The metabolic syndrome is a complex clustering of metabolic defects associated with physical inactivity, abdominal adiposity, and aging. PURPOSE: To examine the effects of exercise training intensity on abdominal visceral fat (AVF) and body composition in obese women with the metabolic syndrome. METHODS: Twenty-seven middle-aged obese women (mean +/- SD; age = 51 +/- 9 yr and body mass index = 34 +/- 6 kg x m(-2)) with the metabolic syndrome completed one of three 16-wk aerobic exercise interventions: (i) no-exercise training (Control): seven participants maintained their existing levels of physical activity; (ii) low-intensity exercise training (LIET): 11 participants exercised 5 d x wk(-1) at an intensity < or = lactate threshold (LT); and (iii) high-intensity exercise training (HIET): nine participants exercised 3 d x wk(-1) at an intensity > LT and 2 d x wk(-1) < or = LT. Exercise time was adjusted to maintain caloric expenditure (400 kcal per session). Single-slice computed tomography scans obtained at the L4-L5 disc space and midthigh were used to determine abdominal fat and thigh muscle cross-sectional areas. Percent body fat was assessed by air displacement plethysmography. RESULTS: HIET significantly reduced total abdominal fat (P < 0.001), abdominal subcutaneous fat (P = 0.034), and AVF (P = 0.010). There were no significant changes observed in any of these parameters within the Control or the LIET conditions. CONCLUSIONS: The present data indicate that body composition changes are affected by the intensity of exercise training with HIET more effectively for reducing total abdominal fat, subcutaneous abdominal fat, and AVF in obese women with the metabolic syndrome.	1
A sex tape featuring the late transgender rights activist Alexis Arquette has been sold to a porn company for $25,000. The tape, part of which has been seen by DailyMail.com and which shows the actress in a compromising position, has now been destroyed. Arquette, who was 47, died from AIDS-related complications in the early hours of Sunday morning in a Los Angeles hospital. But less than 24 hours later, a former lover began hawking the tape – which is thought to have been made around two years ago – in a bid to cash in on her death. Online porn site xHamster.com paid the five-figure sum for the video late on Monday but told DailyMail.com on Tuesday that every copy of the tape has now been obliterated. Speaking exclusively to DailyMail.com, xHamster spokesman Alex Hawkins said the company acted to stop the man from 'smearing her memory'. Arquette, who was 47, died from AIDS-related complications in the early hours of Sunday morning in a Los Angeles hospital. A sex tape hawked by an ex-lover less than 24 hours later has been bought by a porn site which subsequently destroyed it Arquette had reportedly been living as a man in the final months, a former boyfriend earlier revealed 'Ms. Arquette was an icon and activist in the trans community and we could not see someone smear her memory the way the selling party was trying to do,' he said. 'We acquired the tape and subsequently destroyed all copies of it. 'We hope people will remember Ms. Arquette for the activist that she was and that her memory will continue to live on.' Few details can be released about the seller, apart from the fact he is male, due to a legal agreement signed by the porn company. Arquette, who died surrounded by her loved ones on Sunday morning, was born Robert in July 1969 but transitioned in 2006 – becoming one of the world's most famous transgender women. After transitioning, she became a high profile campaigner for LGBTQ rights but remains best known for her acting career, which included roles in Pulp Fiction and The Wedding Singer. Arquette, who died surrounded by her loved ones on Sunday morning, was born Robert in July 1969. But she transitioned in 2006 – becoming one of the world's most famous transgender women The 47-year-old is thought to have been in a coma in the four days leading up to her death and passed away to the sound of David Bowie's Starman. News of her death was broken by her brother Richmond on social media, who took to Facebook to pay tribute to the late actress. He wrote: 'I am feeling immense gratitude to have been afforded the luxury of sharing life with him/her, for learning from Alexis, for being given the gift of being able to love him/her. 'Thank you, Alexis, I love you and will love you always.' The following day, a former boyfriend, Robert Dupont, 47, revealed that the actress had died of complications related to AIDS – and claimed she had begun living as a man again just before her death. 'Alexis was living with AIDS and he had an inoperable tumor and he had developed an infection. I was told that went to his liver and throughout his body,' Dupont told Radar Online. 'My twin brother Richard and I had lunch with him in Santa Monica less than a month ago,' Arquette's former boyfriend continued. 'Ms. Arquette was an icon and activist in the trans community and we could not see someone smear her memory the way the selling party was trying to do,' a spokesman for xHamster said 'Alexis had changed over and was living as a man again and he asked me if I had any clothes I didn't want that he could wear. I had only a few things I had with me as I was visiting from Palm Springs.' He also revealed that Arquette had spent his final months living in an Actor's Fund home for people with HIV but 'hated it'. 'He was working as an artist and living in an Actors Fund home in West Hollywood for people with HIV and AIDS. He hated it,' said Dupont. 'People kept breaking into his apartment and they did alcohol and drugs. Alexis hated that. He never did drugs and he didn't drink.' Meanwhile, tributes to the late star have flooded in – including from Arquette's former sister-in-law Courtney Cox, 52. The ex-Friends actress, who was married to Arquette's brother David between 1999 and 2003, wrote on social media that she would 'love and miss you forever'. David Arquette was spotted attending a funeral home on Monday following the death of his	1
Updated August 11, 2012, 1:28 AM ET (CBS/AP) NORFOLK, Va. - Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney will announce his running mate Saturday morning in Norfolk, Va., his campaign said Friday night. The short list of candidates -- if there is one -- is believed to include Wisconsin Rep. Paul Ryan, Ohio Sen. Rob Portman and former Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty. In a statement issued Friday night, the Romney campaign said the running mate would be revealed at 9 a.m. EDT at the Nauticus Museum. Romney is kicking off a four-day bus tour through swing states. A source tells CBS News that Romney called Portman to say he wouldn't be vice president. Portman will be participating in a bike ride in Ohio Saturday, as planned, to raise money for cancer research. Speculation has focused in recent days on Ryan, the seven-term congressman. Conservative pundits have been urging Romney to choose Ryan in large part because of his authorship of a House-backed budget plan that seeks to curb overall entitlement spending and changes Medicaid into a voucher-like system to save costs. Pawlenty was maintaining his Saturday schedule campaigning for Romney in New Hampshire, an official close to Pawlenty's political team said. The person spoke on the condition of anonymity because the person was not authorized to speak ahead of the formal announcement. The Wall Street Journal, in an editorial on Thursday, praised Ryan as a strong choice for Romney: "The case for Mr. Ryan is that he best exemplifies the nature and stakes of this election. More than any other politician, the House budget chairman has defined those stakes well as a generational choice about the role of government and whether America will once again become a growth economy or sink into interest-group dominated decline." Romney's choice comes as he tries to repair an image damaged by negative Democratic advertising and shift the trajectory of a campaign that's seen him lose ground to President Barack Obama. The vice presidential selection will dominate headlines, and Romney's team has been relentlessly teasing the announcement for weeks. Romney's bus tour was expected to include appearances with Portman, as well as two others talked about as possible contenders for running mate: Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio. The tour starts Saturday and will take Romney through four must-win states in as many days: North Carolina, Virginia, Florida and Ohio. All are battlegrounds where Obama won in 2008. While Obama could afford to lose in one or more of them and still reach the 270 electoral votes needed for another term, Romney almost certainly needs all four to beat him.	1
A man has become the first person in Scotland to be convicted of illegally recording in a cinema and uploading films for profit. Christopher Clarke pleaded guilty to a charge under the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988. The 25-year-old was sentenced at Glasgow Sheriff Court to 160 hours of community service. Clarke was caught after an operation between police, Cineworld and the Federation Against Copyright Theft. The Crown Office said it was a landmark conviction for illegal recording in a Scottish cinema. John Dunn, area procurator fiscal for Glasgow, said: "Christopher Clarke repeatedly pirated films from cinema screenings and uploaded them to the internet for profit. "Piracy is by no means a victimless crime - it undermines legitimate businesses and the arts sector as a whole, and can be used to channel money into organised crime. "I hope this sends a strong message to all those who believe that they can remain anonymous solely because they commit their crimes over the internet. "They should beware that the investigative authorities of Scotland work tirelessly to remain at the forefront of forensic computer analysis and technological specialism - we can and will track down those who pirate films, whether the profit is made in cyberspace or a marketplace."	1

Currently the labeling of rivers is a bit of kludge (i.e., a complete kludge) that happens separately before all the other labeling.  The algorithm looks along the river for a spot long enough to accommodate the label and not too curvy.  If there's a city or another river joining this river, the algorithm skips over that obstruction and starts looking again.  If it eventually finds a suitable spot, it makes a copy of the river (path) where it wants to place the label, relaxes the copied path (so it's less curvy than the river) and then writes the label along that path with an offset so that it isn't directly on top of the river.  Somewhere in there it also has to figure out whether to flip the label so that it doesn't end up reading left-to-right.  (In the above map, you can see that "R. Geheyusckuta" has been flipped.) Generally speaking, this works fairly well but has some drawbacks.  The algorithm is conservative, so when it places a river label it usually looks okay, but it means a lot of rivers go unlabeled.  And since river labels are placed before all other labels and treated as obstacles, they sometimes prevent good placement of other labels.  Finally, the algorithm is specific to rivers, and doesn't work for labeling other paths.  For these reasons, I'd like to build general path labels into the simulated annealing algorithm, and let them get positioned in concert with all the other labels.  Much of what I have written for the existing river labels algorithm will still be applicable.  The simulated annealing will find a location for the label, but the rest of displaying the label on the map will be very similar to the current algorithm.  (I hope!) To add path labels to the simulated annealing algorithm I need two elements: (1) a way to find new candidate locations, and (2) the criteria for judging how good a location would be for the label. A candidate location for a path label starts by selecting a location on the path.  Just to get the code going, I started by selecting the start of the river and anchoring the labels there. (I've turned off the forests to make the labels more visible.)  That seems to be working, so now I'll extend that to anchor the label at a random point along the length of the river, like this: This is actually a little harder to do than you might imagine, because I have the path as a series of line segments.  So picking a random point along there involves something like picking a random line segment -- weighted by the length of the segment -- and then picking a random point within the segment.  Fortunately, there turns out to be an easier approach. Since I've drawn the path, I can make use of some of the browser-provided methods for dealing with SVG paths.  It turns out that the browser provides a method for measuring down the length of a path and finding the screen point at that location.  So I can generate a candidate point by generating a random number between 0 and the length of the path and then using the SVG method to find the point at that distance.  This point represents the start of the label.  Here's what it looks like to generate random start points this way and anchor the labels there: So now I have a method that can generate a new candidate position for the start of the label somewhere along the river.  However, recall that in simulated annealing there's a "temperature" that drops as the algorithm progresses.  As the temperature drops, new candidate positions should jump around less -- that is, they should progressively be restricted to being closer and closer to the current position.  I accommodate this by picking points in a window around the current position, rather than randomly along the whole length of the river.  As the temperature drops, I make the window smaller and smaller. In the picture above, the labels are horizontal like the city and area labels.  But for path labels, I don't want them to be horizontal, but to follow the path.  To get started implementing that, I need the point on the path where the label would end if it was lying along the path.  In other words, if the label has a length 'l', I now want to look along the path until I find a point that is at least 'l' distance away from the start point: The closest this point can be (if the path in-between is a straight line) is an additional distance "l" down the path.  If the path is not perfectly straight, then it's actually further along the path.  In that case, I step along the path in small increments until I hit the first point that is "l" or further away from the start point. (Mentally you may be objecting that this isn't exactly right if	1

Survivor: Blood vs. Water was the first season to see loved ones competing against each other, and two of those loved ones pairs were married couples Brad and Monica Culpepper and John and Candice Cody. The castaways were divided into two tribes: Galang, comprised of returning players, and Tadhana, the returning players' loved ones. John's wife Candice was booted from Galang in an immediate vote-off and sent to Redemption Island. Despite this initial setback, John quickly got himself into the majority on Tadhana as part of Brad's all guys alliance. John trusted Brad, even going so far as to share idol clues with him, but as Tadhana continued to lose, Brad became paranoid that Candice would return to the game and take John away from him. Brad's paranoia led to him blindsiding John and sending him to Redemption Island; this move saw the end of the all guys alliance when at the next tribal council the tribe voted out Brad. Both John and Brad eventually lost at Redemption Island, leaving the game pre-merge. Inside Survivor reached out to John to get his thoughts on Brad's return to Survivor: Game Changers. Disclaimer: This interview was conducted in June 2016 while Survivor: Game Changers was still filming in Fiji. 1) Hey John, thanks for doing this. In Blood vs. Water, it was presented on TV as if Brad was in control of those first few votes. Was that true? If so, how did he gain such control? Brad was definitely in control for the first vote, since he quickly went around and got all the guys together. Everyone was on board with not being the first to go home, so we let it ride. He definitely was less in control the second vote. At that point, Vytas Baskauskas really took over until the swap in my opinion. 2) He came across to viewers as a bold, in-your-face type character. What was he like to live with day-to-day? Big personality all the time? Or did he have a chill side too? Brad is a very entertaining guy. He's very much a "talk first, think later" kind of guy which is great for entertainment purposes. He had a ton of stories and jokes and was generally well liked. That's not to say that his personality isn't off-putting to some people. He would definitely fill the air if it were vacant, which means a lot coming from a loud, talkative guy like me, and I think that bothered some people. So I guess he's a big personality all the time. Even his "chill" side is intense and high energy. 3) Brad seemed to be all about the "bro down" in Blood vs. Water. What was his relationship like with the women on the tribe? I don't know what most of the women (except Marissa Peterson) thought on the whole about Brad, but he didn't make much of an effort at all to include them in strategy. I do know that a few people felt like he talked "at" them a lot and not "with" them. 4) Brad blindsided you because he didn't trust that you'd stay loyal to him at the merge. Was Brad right to make that move? What was your plan moving forward? No, it was an idiotic move! We've talked about it since, and he agrees, but always defends it in the context of worrying about his wife, Monica. Ultimately it led to his downfall. Before I was voted out by Brad and Vytas, we hadn't talked about breaking up the five guys alliance at all. His concern was that if Candice came back in (which she very likely would have), that she would not want to work with Brad and Monica. That is probably true, but that was many many moves ahead. He had no idea if Monica would even make it that far. He made a move that fractured our alliance and made people not trust each other, and basically helped keep the tribe weaker and going to tribal council over and over again. At the end of the day, at a really early time point, he turned on the one person who said they would look out for him because I needed people like him around to keep the target off of me. It didn't work out for either of us. I would have kept working with Brad and even Monica if it suited my gameplay, but if I had the opportunity to vote Monica out, I absolutely would have done it after she voted for Candice. The family dynamic was pretty suffocating in our season from a gameplay perspective. 5) What is Brad's most positive attribute and his most negative attribute? Brad is a likable guy, very good at challenges, and really helpful around camp. Honestly, if he can lay low, he probably can do really well and make it far. He's	1
So you bought hair products with the word "curl" on the bottles and watched a few tutorials by a YouTuber who has your dream curls, but for some reason your hair still isn't coming out the way you want it to. Let's take a step back: Do you have the same curl pattern as the person whose curls you're envying? If not, you may be setting your curls up to fail. If you are new to the world of natural curls, getting to know your curl pattern can help you discover styling techniques and products that will work for you. You'll also be able to more easily find the videos that'll be most relevant to you. Related: What's Your Hair Type? Take The Quiz What's a curl pattern? At NaturallyCurly, we find it useful to divide curl patterns into three main groups: wavy, curly, and coily. We know "curly" means a lot of things to a lot of people, and we wince when we see comments on social media saying "Those aren't real curls; those are just waves!" We have no tolerance for comments that insinuate that one curl pattern is better or worse than another. It goes without saying, but we'll say it anyway: We want women of all curl patterns to love and embrace their hair. This texture-typing system is not meant to be divisive, but to provide guidance that will help you care for, style, and LOVE your mane. Where to start The best time to identify your curl pattern is when your hair is at its healthiest state; this means moisturized and free of damage. If you have been straightening your hair for the past few years or even months, you may have heat damage. To get a clear idea of your natural curl pattern, it's best to look at it once you have stopped using heat tools — including blow dryers, flat irons, and curling wands — for at least three months. If the roots are curlier than the ends of your hair, then this is a clear indicator of heat damage, and figuring out your curl pattern may be a struggle until your natural curls grow in and the damaged ends have been cut off. If you have curl patterns that are drastically different from each other, you may want to treat those sections of your hair differently Remember, most people are a mix of a couple of curl patterns. As you can see in the graphic above, we included examples of someone who could be considered Type 2c/3a, and someone who fits in between Types 3c and 4a. If you feel you fit multiple curl patterns, that is totally normal. If you have curl patterns that are drastically different from each other, you may want to treat those sections of your hair differently (for example, using heavier products in one section) or some use perm rods to create a uniform curl pattern. Finding an experienced stylist who knows how to work with curls can also help customize your haircut to accommodate your multiple curl patterns (so one section doesn't look longer than another). Below, find descriptions for the three most common types of curly hair. Within each of the categories, there are more subtle distinctions; read on to determine which one fits you best. Wavy Hair Wavy hair is characterized by S-shaped waves (rather than coils). Women with wavy hair typically use mousses, leave-in serums, and heat protectants rather than creams or gels, and are generally most concerned with reducing their frizz and finding products that will give their waves light hold without weighing them down. Those with wavy hair are less likely to avoid certain ingredients like silicones and sulfates, and more likely to use heat-styling tools like flat irons or curling wands. Think Taylor Swift (back before she straightened her hair) and Lorde. If your hair is close to straight but has a loose, gentle bend, you likely have Type 2a waves. If your hair is mostly straight at the roots and more defined waves form below your eye level, your waves are Type 2b. If your waves start right at the roots and you have very defined waves mixed with actual ringlets, then you are Type 2c. Curly Hair Type 3 hair has more defined, springy curls that form spirals or ringlets. Those with Type 3 hair are mostly concerned with reducing frizz and adding definition. They use creams and gels to give their curls definition, and they're more likely to avoid drying ingredients in their shampoos. If your curls are similar in size to the large sidewalk chalk you used as a kid, then you're Type 3a. If your curls have the circumference of a Sharpie, then you're Type 3b. And if your curls have the circumference of a pencil or a straw, then you're Type 3c. Many people believe (	1
"We knew that hatred will hit us one day but there was always a brink of hope that our community outreach efforts may deflect it away from us," mosque spokesman Muhammad Babar wrote in a letter Thursday. "But fact of the matter is that we are hit hard right here in our compassionate city of Louisville at a place that is [a] center of tolerance and compassion." Louisville police are reviewing surveillance video in an effort to identify any suspects. The FBI is also helping to investigate the vandalism as an apparent hate crime, NBC affiliate WAVE reported. As a way to unite the community, Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer is asking Muslims, Jews and others to come to the center and help paint over the graffiti Friday afternoon. "This is an act of extremism here," Fischer said Thursday, according to the station. "Extremism of any kind will not be tolerated in our city and in our country." Islamic centers across American have been similarly defaced in recent months. Earlier this year, a nonprofit Muslim school in Rhode Island was vandalized with "senseless, hateful comments," police told NBC News.	1
Adelaide warship arrives at Garden Island in Sydney, ahead of commissioning Posted Australia's newest warship, the Adelaide, has been welcomed to its new home at Garden Island in Sydney. After its fit-out in Melbourne and a program of sea trials, the landing helicopter dock NUSHIP Adelaide berthed at Garden Island, pulling in past its sister ship, HMAS Canberra, which was commissioned last year. The 230-metre-long air, land and sea amphibious ships, with their ski-jump flight decks, are the largest ever built for the Australian Navy, displacing a massive 27,000 tonnes and costing just more than $3 billion together. Once Adelaide is commissioned in December, it will carry about 1,000 soldiers alongside the ship's company and apart from its defence role, it will be deployed for humanitarian duties and disaster relief. Robyn Croucher, whose son Matthew is a Leading Seaman aboard the ship, said there was a lot of new equipment on board. "They'll go to sea in December, so I think it will be in and out a lot in the next four years; he's on there for four years now," Mr Croucher said. "There's a lot of training to go on because the technology on here is different than all the other ones anyway." Topics: navy, defence-forces, garden-island-2011	1
FEDERAL Health Minister Tony Abbott has said that while he may be seen as a "cruel, callow, callous, heartless bastard", he would not be rushing to have his own daughters vaccinated against cervical cancer. "I won't be rushing out to get my daughters vaccinated, maybe that's because I'm a cruel, callow, callous, heartless bastard but, look, I won't be," Mr Abbott said on Southern Cross radio.  "If there is a national immunisation program, I certainly will be making sure that they get vaccinated under the program.  "The program is what the experts think clearly is absolutely necessary, and at the moment the experts don't think this is absolutely necessary." The PBAC yesterday knocked back the application from Australian manufacturer CSL to make the Gardasil vaccine available free to all females aged 12 to 26.  Gardasil halts the spread of sexually-transmitted human papilloma virus (HPV), which causes 70 per cent of cervical cancers. At present it costs $460 for the recommended three doses.  The PBAC said it made the decision because the vaccine program - which would have cost about $625 million during its first four years - was not value for money.  CSL and scientists involved have disputed that conclusion, while politicians from both sides have condemned the decision.  Liberal Senator Jeannie Ferris, who is recovering from ovarian cancer, said the opportunity should not be lost, particularly in the country where the vaccine was developed, winning its developers a Nobel Prize.  "How embarrassing that our country is the one that is not going to vaccinate its daughters," she said.  Senator Ferris said the PBAC had made a number of recommendations and Health Minister Tony Abbott said today he was hopeful the decision could be reconsidered by March.  "I have to say I am very disappointed with the decision because the average family might have two daughters and is looking at almost $1000 to decide to give their children lifetime protection. And who doesn't want to do that," she said.  "I am optimistic that commonsense will prevail. Put a price on somebody's mother, somebody's sister, somebody's wife - $400 - I don't think so.  Labor health spokeswoman Julia Gillard said 270 women a year died from cervical cancer and 40 women were operated on every day for the disease.  That made the vaccination both cost-effective and clinically effective, she said on ABC radio.  Queensland Deputy Premier Anna Bligh said the decision was ridiculous and should be reconsidered.  "They should immediately reconsider it, and frankly the Health Minister Tony Abbott, in all conscience, has to intervene."  Ms Bligh said there were medical and economic reasons to subsidise Gardasil.  "This drug has the capacity to keep young women of the next generation free from a very serious life-threatening disease," she said.  "Secondly, if we prevent this disease, we save money in the health system. So it is a false economy for the committee to argue that this is an expensive exercise."	1
In the early 1970s during the Cold War, the head of British Intelligence, Control, resigns after an operation in Budapest, Hungary goes badly wrong. It transpires that Control believed one of four senior figures in the service was in fact a Russian agent - a mole - and the Hungary operation was an attempt to identify which of them it was. Smiley had been forced into retirement by the departure of Control, but is asked by a senior government figure to investigate a story told to him by a rogue agent, Ricky Tarr, that there was a mole. Smiley considers that the failure of the Hungary operation and the continuing success of Operation Witchcraft (an apparent source of significant Soviet intelligence) confirms this, and takes up the task of finding him.

An activist federal judge who declared "Black Lives Matter" in court last year evidently believes Muslims have an unlimited right to enter the United States.  Keep in mind this loon was appointed by George W. Bush.  From The Seattle Times: A federal judge in Seattle has ordered a halt to enforcement of President Trump's controversial travel ban on citizens from seven predominantly Muslim nations.  U.S. District Judge James Robart ruled in favor Friday of Washington Attorney General Bob Ferguson, who sued to invalidate key provisions of Trump's executive order. That order indefinitely blocks entry to the United States for Syrian refugees and temporarily suspends entry to citizens of seven majority-Muslim countries.  The temporary restraining order is granted on a nationwide basis, Robart said.  ...In his oral ruling, Robart said Washington had standing to bring the case forward and provided evidence that Trump's order has immediate harm. And the lawsuit, the judge said, has substantial likelihood of success in its underlying challenge to the constitutionality of the order.  ...In a legal filing asking for the restraining order, Ferguson argued Trump's travel ban targets Muslims, violating the constitutional rights of immigrants and their families.  "Federal courts have no more sacred role than protecting marginalized groups against irrational, discriminatory conduct," reads the filing by Ferguson, state Solicitor General Noah Purcell and Colleen Melody, head of the attorney general's civil-rights unit. FDR literally threw Japanese people in internment camps and that was ruled legal. There's a reason no other judge entertained this garbage. But in a response brief filed late Thursday, attorneys for the Trump administration said Washington state lacked standing to bring the challenge, and that the president has properly exercised his broad, border-security powers to protect Americans.  "Every President over the last thirty years has invoked this authority to suspend or impose restrictions on the entry of certain aliens or classes of aliens, in some instances including classifications based on nationality," reads the administration brief, submitted by Chad Readler, acting assistant U.S. attorney general, and other Justice Department lawyers.  The administration brief also cited previous court rulings that say there is no constitutional right of entry to the U.S. for foreign nationals. I'm surprised Robart didn't throw out a black power fist and scream "Muslim lives matter."  This incident from a few months ago should give you an idea of the type of intellect we're dealing with here.  From The Daily Caller: A federal judge in Washington state declared "black lives matter" during a hearing Monday.  U.S. District Judge James Robart, a former President George W. Bush appointee, is presiding over the implementation of a 2012 consent decree requiring Seattle to adopt various police reforms. The city's police department was accused by the federal government of engaging in various practices, such as excessive force, that fell disproportionately on non-white residents and therefore violated their civil rights. The consent decree was reached so the city could avoid fighting a costly lawsuit against the feds.  This is the first time the contentious political movement has had its anthem officially supported by a judge in a federal courtroom.  Implementing that consent decree is requiring extensive negotiations with Seattle's police union, because some of the reforms it prescribes would modify their current contract. For instance, putting internal investigations in the hands of civilians, rather than police officers. Most recently, the union voted to reject a contract that would have implemented certain reforms while giving officers a small pay boost.  In a Monday hearing, Robart lashed out at the union for holding up the reform process.  "The court and the citizens of Seattle will not be held hostage for increased payments and benefits," he said from the bench. "I'm sure the entire city of Seattle would march behind me."  Then, Robart stunned the courtroom by explicitly tying the proceedings to the Black Lives Matter movement. According to The Seattle Times, he cited statistics that blacks represent 41 percent of all people shot by police, when they are just 20 percent of the population. This is a mistake on Robart's part; blacks are actually just 13 percent of the population.  "Black lives matter," Robart said to end his remarks, in a moment that apparently produced audible shock from the courtroom. Black Lives Matter has been active for three years as a movement, but this appears to be the first time it has garnered such explicit support in court from a federal judge.

Confidence Intervals & Hypothesis Testing (1 of 5) visual auditory There is an extremely close relationship between confidence intervals and hypothesis testing . When a 95% confidence interval is constructed, all values in the interval are considered plausible values for the parameter being estimated. Values outside the interval are rejected as relatively implausible. If the value of the parameter specified by the null hypothesis is contained in the 95% interval then the null hypothesis cannot be rejected at the 0.05 level . If the value specified by the null hypothesis is not in the interval then the null hypothesis can be rejected at the 0.05 level. If a 99% confidence interval is constructed, then values outside the interval are rejected at the 0.01 level.Imagine a researcher wishing to test the null hypothesis that the mean time to respond to an auditory signal is the same as the mean time to respond to a visual signal. The null hypothesis therefore is:- μ= 0.Ten subjects were tested in the visual condition and their scores (in milliseconds) were: 355, 421, 299, 460, 600, 580, 474, 511, 550, and 586.	1

What Legal Recourse Do Victims Of Fake News Stories Have? Enlarge this image toggle caption Nicholas Kamm /AFP/Getty Images Nicholas Kamm /AFP/Getty Images Fake news played a bigger role in this past presidential election than ever seen before. And sometimes it has had serious repercussions for real people and businesses. That's what happened to a pizzeria in Washington, D.C., recently, when an armed man claiming to be "self-investigating" a fake news story entered the restaurant and fired off several rounds. But once a fake news story is out there, and the harm has been done, what can a person do about it? Derigan Silver, a professor of media, First Amendment and Internet law at the University of Denver, tells NPR's Audie Cornish that victims of fake news stories have legal recourse under defamation law. "Fake news sites are clearly a situation where they're engaging in a defamatory statement, a false statement about another that damages that person's reputation," Silver says. "In that situation, that is certainly actionable." Interview Highlights On the legal recourse for victims of fake news stories So in most of these situations, the person that has been harmed is going to bring a lawsuit that we call a tort. Now a tort is a noncontractual harm between two private individuals. It's a civil lawsuit, where you're alleging that one person harmed another. ... So anytime one private individual harms another private individual, you can bring a lawsuit for a tort. So one of those torts that people can have advantage of is called defamation. Defamation is a tort that alleges that a communication damaged your reputation. On who's accountable for fake news stories They can hold accountable anybody who has communicated the defamatory statement to anybody else. That includes the person who originated the defamatory statement, but under something called the republication rule, it also includes anybody who repeated the defamatory statement. Now simply retweeting a defamatory statement is probably not going to be enough to qualify for republication, but passing on information that you heard from somebody else certainly is republication. So you have some cases coming out of Texas, for example, where hundreds and hundreds of people were adding to a posting that had more and more and more defamatory contents. And if you can track those people down, if you can find out those identities, then yes, you can sue every single person who sort of adds to that defamatory statement or repeats that defamatory statement. U.S. Comet Ping Pong Owner James Alefantis On Conspiracy Theory Ordeal Fake News Surge Pins D.C. Pizzeria As Home To Child-Trafficking Listen · 3:55 3:55 On the challenges of filing defamation lawsuits That's one of the problems with defamation law is once the information is out there, is monetary damages really what they want to recover? And should they have to be able to pay lawyers [$400], $500 an hour in order to recover their good name from a story that is clearly made up and clearly fictitious and clearly has no basis in reality at all? On the current debate over defamation laws I think that fake news really has kind of all set us back a little bit. One of the ideas behind the First Amendment is that we believe in something called the marketplace of ideas: that if you let "truthhood" and falsity battle in the marketplace of ideas, that truth will eventually win, that we have an assumption that people are rational, and they can determine truth from falsity. And that's kind of making us rethink these kind of basic premises behind freedom of expression. Are we in a situation now where truth no longer matters, and people are not able to sort these things out? Other people say, you know, the idea that truth is always going to win is idle sentimentality. The reason we have freedom of expression is not because truth will always win, but because without freedom of expression, truth has no chance of winning whatsoever. And so this has been a really challenging election for a lot of people who believe in free speech, and media law has actually come up a lot in this election, and it's something that a lot of us are thinking deeply about.	1
Prepare for traffic delays during Saturday's Woodlands Marathon Image 1 of / 1 Caption Close Prepare for traffic delays during Saturday's Woodlands Marathon 1 / 1 Back to Gallery The Woodlands Marathon, hosted by The Woodlands Marathon Management LLC, was reborn in the community in 2012, and since then has raised and donated over $650,000 to nonprofit and volunteer organizations across the nation. The Woodlands Marathon is set for Saturday, March 4, and begins at 7 a.m. The run features different divisions, the full marathon and half-marathon, a marathon relay and a 5K Saturday, as well as a 2K Fun Run and Walk Friday evening. The marathon is one of the largest athletic events in Montgomery County, having nearly 9,000 runners set to participate in this year's event. The 2017 event has raised over $150,000 and has a $6 million economic impact on The Woodlands community, said event director of The Woodlands Marathon Management Will Fowlkes. Aside from the economic impact, it will force road closures across the community. Travel time will be extended during this time - approximately 45 minutes to an hour delay, according to the marathon's website. Between 6:30 a.m. and 1:30 p.m., marathon officials recommend only residential traffic. A detailed list of road closures and delays can be found at thewoodlandsmarathon.com/event-details/traffic-guide/. However, check back on Friday, as the traffic guide will be updated then. Fowlkes said residents should educate themselves on the ins and outs of the race, even if one is not participating. Fowlkes said the community should expect slight delays, but they'll still have the ability to commute around The Woodlands, they just may have to take alternative routes to get to destinations. "Ninety to 95 percent of The Woodlands residents are OK with the events," Fowlkes said. "It's just those residents that do not plan and educate themselves about the route that seem to get frustrated." Specifically, Fowlkes said, the Town Center area on Grogan's Mill Road and Lake Woodlands Drive will be the most affected by the marathon and half-marathon. Vehicles will be routed around those areas, but there will be rolling road openings throughout the race until 1:30 p.m. to ease delays. Those interested in participating can still register online for $40 for the 5K run or $30 for the 2K Family Fun Run and Walk.	1
Skip Bayless: McCaffrey is a brilliant receiver, but he's more of a 'luxury back' "He can slash it between the tackles and he can flat out catch it sideways or upfield. They ran routes for him that were Dede Westbrook kind of routes, where he will catch it down the field like a wideout can. Obviously he is not Christian McCaffrey, who is a wideout by trade - he was born to be a wideout because he played with his father, who could catch the football and he could fly. And [McCaffrey] can really fly, and we know how he did at the Combine and backed all that up. But I still wonder about Christian running between the tackles consistently as an every-down back. I'm just not sure he can take the pounding, because he started to unravel a little bit last year at Stanford. He was taking a lot of shots, and he was not healthy for the whole year. He was banged up most of the year because I thought they over-utilized him between the tackles. … He's still got a bit of a 'luxury back' [feel] to me, where if you're really good, he can make you great, because he is very difficult to match up with. But you need to swing it to him, you need to toss it to him … whatever you want to do to get him in the open field."	1
With their disappointing Premier League campaign coming to a close, Chelsea will be looking for a renaissance next year—and a young Canadian might just be part of that revitalization plan. On Wednesday, 18-year-old defender Fikayo Tomori made his first appearance on the matchday roster for the Blues, in their penultimate league match of the season against Liverpool. Two days later, he was named the London powerhouse's Academy Player of the Year. Well done to Fikayo Tomori - our Academy Player of the Year! #CFCPOTY2016 pic.twitter.com/WsDlSNkrpJ — Chelsea FC (@ChelseaFC) May 13, 2016 It's just the latest step for Tomori, who's been a part of the Chelsea system for most of his life. Born in Calgary, Tomori has lived in England with his family since he was a toddler, and has been in Chelsea's youth system since age 8. The right-sided player, who has played as both a central defender and a fullback, proved precocious as he worked his way up the ranks, debuting for Chelsea's Under-18 squad at age 16, before appearing for both the U-19 and U-21 squads the following year (2014-15). The 2015-16 campaign has been even more eventful for Tomori, at both the club and international level. In November 2015, he made his debut in the Canadian program, joining a U-20 training camp under head coach Rob Gale. "He loves to defend, he's an out-and-out defender," Gale told MLSsoccer.com on Wednesday. "He loves the 1-v-1 defending, he's very good in those situations. He has a desire, an aggression about him, to win the ball back. It's a trait we've almost lost in our modern defenders." In March, he was back with the Canadian Under-20 team, wearing the captain's armband in the team's surprising 2-1 win over England in a friendly. Gale says Tomori's years of service in Chelsea's youth ranks made him a natural fit as captain. "He brings a lot of experience to our group," said Gale. "He's not the most vocal of players, but that experience, you can see it in the way that he competes." Despite his defensive-minded tendencies, Tomori has found the back of the net on occasion; most notably, he scored a goal in Chelsea's victory in the final of the 2015-16 FA Youth Cup, the club's second straight Cup title. And, back in February, he scored some brownie points with cynical soccer fans around the world when he accidentally broke teammate Diego Costa's nose during a training stint with the first team. Gale plans to call Tomori into the Canadian U-20 squad later this month, for a training camp and pair of friendlies in Costa Rica. And while nothing is ever certain for any promising young player, fans will hope that Tomori – who is signed with Chelsea through the 2017-18 season – will be wearing plenty more blue (and red) for years to come.	1
Did South African higher education have a hand in our resurgent student voice? Absolutely, student activists would argue, but for its lack of transformation serving as an obstacle rather than an ally in the project of change. Campus debates on change relate not only to transformation but also to how prominent and capable student voices feature in struggles for institutional identity, values and curriculum. Much more than Mcebo Dlamini's Hitler comments, it is the exciting commentaries on higher education change in campaigns such as #RhodesMustFall, #TransformWits and #OpenStellies that demand higher education examine its engagement of student provocateurs. On the back foot Despite their authentic attempts to expedite change, more often than not universities seem to be on the back foot when students disrupt established lines of thought and practice — a stance that would not be worrying if South African students could claim a well-established and accomplished position as co-creators of knowledge in the classroom and as co-authors of institutional transformation. A poo-protest to disrupt colonial history surely would read different when a university community already are engaged in difficult dialogues and openly debate difficult decisions on institutional change, as also would protesters chained to Paul Kruger's statue to protect their heritage. One problem key to students' distrust of higher education transformation is that of a silent vanguard — the silent voice of the student affairs' division in the higher education debate. As a penultimate institutional environment that concerns itself with the holistic wellness and development of students, the student affairs' office offers campus communities access to and sites for talking and listening to students. There, in the residence hall, on the sport field, at the theatre or the freshers' ball, across the forum table, on social media and in counselling sessions, student affairs practitioners hear, see and discover the hearts and minds of students — the full range of social spaces that students live with are its concern, and its classroom. Student affairs as vanguard For this reason, as students offer a vanguard to society, student affairs could do so for higher education. At its best, student affairs as a vanguard contributes most to institutional debates when it facilitates a vibrant student voice in the authorship of an institutional narrative – the lived experience and sense of identity of a campus community, and its story then told. Student affairs must do what a vanguard should – move with next generation to discover new perspectives and translate its discoveries for a campus community that follows. Get it right and the university community knows what debates the next generation will point at, but get it wrong, and the vanguard is silent, or worse still, silenced, and the student voice left to a nervous condition. Students become authors when they achieve that level of wellness and capability to critically reflect on their life narrative, identity and aspirations in relation to that of others and their society, and ethically act to change their environment and serve the common good. This project succeeds outside the classroom when student development and support combine well in daily student life – opportunities to develop activist skills and social support for quality of life are sides of the same coin in student affairs practice. Teaching under trees But what many campuses misjudge is the complexity of this interface of learning and support – the landscape of curriculum logic and pedagogy as a major part of professional support and student development programmes. It is for instance a complex matter to mentor leaders, while also administrating the logistics of housing, but this is precisely what student affairs as a higher education vanguard must do. This is teaching in the mode of serving students holistically. This is teaching under trees, a way of life. While campuses value the vanguard voice of student affairs differently, often in worst cases limiting its contribution to operational planning and practice as support service environment, student affairs often are silent more than silenced. Silent, when student affairs environments do not appropriately engage the educational project required to facilitate authorship among students, or do not appropriately translate the student voice institutionally. Strong vanguard voice Its educational project for student authorship should consist of the curriculum design, pedagogical practice and assessment of student development programmes, such as for student leadership development, but also for student life and wellness programmes co-created by students and student affairs practitioners. Its translation project for student authorship should consist of institutional advocacy for depth and reach of student participation, establishment of safe spaces for challenging dialogue and facilitating a vibrant student initiative. In vigorous pedagogy and unrelenting advocacy lies a strong vanguard voice. What recent student activism unmasks is the silence of our vanguard – silent not for its lack of an educational project, but for the hidden and hesitant position of its curriculum and pedagogy. What student affairs in South Africa now needs, is to make plain its vanguard pedagogy, its teaching under trees.	1
REVERSE MESSAGES IN JOHN TRAVOLTA'S MOVIE – PHENOMENON By David John Oates Copyright © 1996 New Reversals on movie soundtrack posted below (4/16/00) Authors note: Recently I have been contacted by several people wanting to use this article and other reversals I have found on "Phenomenon" to bolster an argument that Scientology are using subliminal programming in this and other publications. I do not believe this to be the case! What you are seeing is the Reverse Speech phenomenon in action and it occurs in all forms of human speech. The deliberate "backmasked" section on Peter Gabriel's song is a common recording trick used by many artists for special effects. There is nothing sinister in this at all. To those people wanting to use this as an arguement, I say the same thing to you as I said to the fundamentalist christians when they went ballistic over reversed messages in rock and roll songs. Look at your own speech and publications before you jump to rapid judgement at others. You will find the same messages in your speech as you claim others are deliberately putting into theirs. Reverse Speech is everywhere – in the goodies as well as the baddies. It is a natural function of language, no more and no less. (DJO 4/2000) In the middle of 1996, John Travolta's new movie Phenomenon was released. The movie was about a simple farmer who was hit by a strange beam of light from the sky. This gave him amazing new intelligence and unexplained powers. Since the movie's release, controversy has begun to arise concerning its real message and purpose. According to the Globe tabloid, which quotes two disc jockeys from Flint Michigan, Phenomenon is riddled with secret references to John Travolta's belief in Scientology. Click here to see a reprint of the Globe article. One of the specific claims is that the movie's theme song, "I have the touch", sung by British rocker Peter Gabriel, contains hidden backward messages. The most obvious, according to Mitch Gill and Tommy Walker (the Michigan DJs) is the very clear phrase, "Don't you miss Ron?" This is supposedly a reference to Scientology's founder, the late Ron Hubbard. I spoke with Mitch and Tommy by phone and was curious enough to do some of my own research. As charges of intentional backmasking were denied by Peter Gabriel's publicist, I initially assumed that the song contained the standard speech reversals that I have discovered occur in all music and speech. As these reversals are a natural function of the human mind, they appear in all songs and are, naturally, unplanned by the recording studio or artist. It seemed fairly logical to me that speech reversals would occur that supported Travolta's belief in Scientology. There seemed to be nothing too sinister in that. However, I was in for a shock when I finally obtained a copy for the album after being approached by the nationally syndicated TV program, "Extra", for my opinion on the controversy. The very first thing I noticed as I played the song forwards was an intentionally backmasked message right at the beginning of the album. Intentional backmasking is totally different from Reverse Speech. Reverse Speech naturally occurs in the human mind as an automatic function of language. Backmasking is a recording technique where the studio superimposes a soundtrack backwards over the forward soundtrack. It is easy to recognise. It sounds like gibberish when the track is played forwards and becomes an intelligible sentence when the track is played backwards. Reverse Speech has no superimposed soundtrack and occurs solely by the way the words are sung or spoken at the time the recording is made. Listen to the first example of a hidden message on this song. Notice that is sounds like gibberish forwards. When it is played backwards at three separate speeds, the words "Don't you miss Ron?" can be heard. It sounds a little strange because it has been hidden somewhat by echo effects. This is an example of an intentionally backmasked message (Backward Masking) at the recording studio level. I am somewhat surprised, therefore, that Peter Gabriel's publicist has denied putting this in because it is an obvious technical insertion. Maybe it was done in the recording studio after the song was made. Either way, there is nothing sinister in this. The message is meaningless. The next thing I noticed as I listened to the soundtrack forwards is that there is also an example of a hidden subliminal message in the song. It is forwards, faint and fast, and occurs right at the very end of the soundtrack. It says: "Ron Hubbard, Ron Ron Ron, Ron Hubbard make contact." It is unclear whether this was intentional or not. Finally I checked the soundtrack for Reverse Speech and my eyes really opened wide. I first found a very clear example	1

In yesterday's article we covered the beginner and intermediate versions of the pyramid routine. Today we will cover the advanced versions of weight training using pyramid routines – the Oxford Method and ascending rest-pause routine. For some people, the Oxford Method is more of an intermediate pyramid routine. It is similar to reverse pyramid sets. You will use a really heavy weight for the first set and decrease as your muscles fatigue for each subsequent set. Your rep range will be dependent upon the type of training you want to do – low reps (4-6) for strength/power, average reps (8-12) for building mass and high reps (15-20) for endurance. To do the first set, choose a weight that you can JUST do 10 times and cannot do the 11th rep. For the next set, you will do the same thing except use a lower weight (usually 10% less than set 1). You should just complete 10 reps. For the third and final set, decrease the weight again and do 10 more reps. Depending on how aggressive you want to be, 2 sets may be enough or you may want to increase it to 4. For example: The most advanced form of Pyramid Routine is the ascending rest-pause. The intent is to workout with larger weights but to mix in rest periods to allow your muscles to recover partially before continuing. Choose a weight that you can do for 10 reps but only do 5. Rest for 5 seconds and then do 5 more reps. Rest another 5 seconds and do 5 more reps. That makes one set. Add 5-10 pounds of weight (your 9 rep max) and do the same process but for 4 reps and rest for 10 seconds. Continue to 3 reps with 5-10 more pounds and rest 15 seconds then to 2 reps with 5-10 more pounds. This last set is done to failure; keep doing 2 reps with rest breaks until you cannot do 2 reps. For example:  Using this method will generate a lot of muscle growth by stimulating your muscles at their peak exhaustion level. Did This Blog Help You?

After becoming the top Democrat on the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee in January, Sen. Patty Murray is among the leading backers of a White House plan to expand overtime pay for nearly 5 million Americans. WASHINGTON — With only 8 percent of salaried workers currently covered by overtime rules, Sen. Patty Murray says it's time for the federal government to intervene. After becoming the top Democrat on the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee in January, the senator from Washington state is among the leading backers of a White House plan to expand overtime pay for nearly 5 million Americans. It could mean raises for 90,000 workers in her home state. Murray faces resistance from retailers who fear that higher pay would force them to cut jobs and reduce work hours. She counters that the overtime rules are outdated, doing little to help workers who are routinely assigned to longer hours. "It would mean a lot of money in people's pockets, and what it basically means is you're going to get paid for the work that you do," Murray said in an interview Tuesday. In the mid-1970s, Murray said, 62 percent of the American workforce was covered by overtime rules, but that number has been in steady decline. Under federal law, hourly employees are guaranteed overtime pay for working more than 40 hours per week, receiving at least 1½ times their regular rate of pay. But the rules limit overtime pay for salaried workers to those who earn less than $23,660 per year. Under the White House plan announced earlier this month by President Obama, that threshold would more than double, to $50,440. Murray said she's confident that the new rule will take effect after the Department of Labor seeks comment on the proposal. Murray said the only way it can be blocked is if Congress intervenes. Even then, she said, Obama could use his veto power to prevail. "This is something that is going to happen," Murray said. So far, the proposal isn't causing much of a fuss in Washington state. The Washington Retail Association, based in Olympia, said it had not yet decided how to react, while Amazon, the Seattle-based Internet retail giant, did not respond to a request for comment. In Washington, D.C., it's a much different story. In a statement, the National Retail Federation, the nation's largest retail trade association, called the plan an attempt to "build the middle class by government mandate." "There simply isn't any magic pot of money that lets employers pay more just because the government says so," said David French, the group's senior vice president for government relations. And House Republicans, anticipating the White House move, called a hearing on the plan in June, nearly a month before Obama announced the proposed change. "Rather than providing more opportunities for individuals to earn overtime pay, it appears that the new regulations will only result in a more complicated law, requiring outside legal advice for small businesses, and more litigation," said Jamie Richardson, White Castle's vice president of government and shareholder relations, testifying before the House Subcommittee on Workforce Protections. Despite the opposition, Murray said the plan will boost the economy by helping people spend more. "If they get that additional money for working more, they're going to have more in their pockets to take their kids out for pizza or to buy them another pair of shoes for school or to perhaps save for their college," she said. The issue is just one of many pro-labor plans on Murray's plate this year, after she replaced former Iowa Sen. Tom Harkin as the ranking Democrat on the Health, Education and Pensions Committee. Murray called it a "rewarding assignment." While she has gained much attention for overhauling the No Child Left Behind schools law, she has also used her new perch to promote a series of labor issues. Among them: • She's the chief sponsor of the Raise the Wage Act, which would increase the federal minimum wage to $12 by 2020. • She's the lead Senate Democrat on The Healthy Families Act, which would require employers to provide up to seven paid sick days per year. It would apply to companies with more 15 employees. • She teamed up with Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren, of Massachusetts, to introduce a bill aimed at giving workers more predictability in their work schedules. It would require retail, food service and cleaning employees to receive work schedules at least two weeks in advance, or one hour's worth of extra pay for schedules changed with less than a 24-hour notice. • She has pushed to close the wage gap between men and women working the same jobs. And she released a report showing the challenges women face in retirement, with a poverty rate nearly double that of men among those 65 and older. For Murray, a 64-year-old former preschool	1
Breach of Confidence In order to establish an actionable breach of confidence, the complainant must prove (a) that the information conveyed was confidential, (b) that it was communicated in confidence, (c) that it was misused by the party to whom it was communicated, and (d) detriment to the complainant. International Corona v Lac Minerals, [1989] 2 S.C.R. 574. A person who receives confidential information in circumstances of confidence has a duty not to use that information for any purpose other than that for which it was conveyed. If the information is used for such an unauthorized purpose, and the person who provided that confidential information suffers a detriment, the court will grant a remedy. "In establishing a breach of a duty of confidence, the relevant question to be asked is, "what is the confidee entitled to do with the information?" and not, "to what use he is prohibited from putting it?" Any use other than a permitted use is prohibited and amounts to a breach of duty. When information is provided in confidence, the obligation is on the confidee to show that the use to which he put the information is not a prohibited use." International Corona v Lac Minerals, [1989] 2 S.C.R. 574. In certain circumstances, the recipient of confidential information will provide it to third parties. Where such third parties are in possession of confidential information, a key consideration for the court will be whether the third party knew or ought to have known that the information is confidential. This may be implied from the nature of the information itself or the circumstances in which the third party received it. Roger D. McConchie has considerable experience advising clients with respect to breach of confidence claims.	1

Fresh off first-round wins in December, Erick Silva and Ben Saunders are set to collide in Brazil. Silva and Saunders, who scored wins over Mike Rhodes and Joe Riggs at UFC Fight Night 58 and UFC on FOX 13, respectively, will meet at the upcoming UFC Fight Night 62 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on March 21. MMAFighting.com confirmed the bout following a report from Lance. Hoping to start his first win streak in the UFC, Silva (17-5, 1 no-contest) gets back in action following a 75-second submission over Rhodes in Barueri, Brazil. The X-Gym fighter, who lost to Matt Brown prior to his win in December, has bounced between wins and losses since his UFC debut in 2011. Saunders (18-6-2), who returned to the UFC after a 7-3 run in Bellator between 2011 and 2013, won back-to-back fights against Riggs and Chris Heatherly inside the Octagon, scoring the first-ever omoplata submission in the UFC history over Heatherly in August. Headlined by a bantamweight clash between Urijah Faber and Raphael Assuncao, UFC Fight Night 62 takes place at the Maracanazinho gymnasium in Rio de Janeiro. A lightweight bout featuring Josh Thomson and Gilbert Burns is also agreed for the fight card.	1
Apple Inc. sold twice as many Watches as iPhones in each device's debut year. Yet the smartwatch is dogged by a perception that seems premature given the history of Apple's most popular devices: disappointment. As the Watch marks its first anniversary on Sunday—two days before Apple's quarterly earnings announcement—the product's fate is critical to the company. It is Apple's first all-new product since the iPad and a test of its ability to innovate under Chief Executive Tim Cook, when sales of iPhones are slowing. ​So far, the numbers appear solid. Apple doesn't disclose sales, but analysts estimate about 12 million Watches were sold in year one. At an estimated average price of $500, that is a $6 billion business—three times the annual revenue of activity tracker Fitbit Inc. By comparison, Apple sold roughly six million iPhones in its first year. As a new entrant, the Watch accounted for about 61% of global smartwatch sales last year, according to researcher IDC. And yet, there are detractors such as Fred Wilson, co-founder of venture-capital firm Union Square Ventures, in December declared the Watch a "flop." Mr. Wilson, who owns shares of Fitbit through a fund, had earlier predicted the Watch wouldn't be a "home run" like the iPad, iPhone and iPod, saying many people wouldn't want to wear a computer on their wrist. The Watch has shortcomings. It is slow, with an underpowered processor that is throttled at times to extend the device's battery life. It lacks mobile and Global Positioning System connections, meaning it must be accompanied by an iPhone, limiting its usefulness as an independent device. The battery needs to be charged every day. Advertisement Perhaps the biggest challenge is the Watch's lack of a defining purpose. It does certain things well, such as activity tracking, mobile payments and notifications. But there is no task the Apple Watch handles that can't be done by an iPhone or a less-expensive activity tracker. Joshua Stein, a 33-year-old app developer in Chicago, said he bought a Watch shortly after its release, but found the software slow and thought it was inconvenient having to charge it each night. In January, he sold the Watch on eBay and returned to using a $150 Pebble smartwatch with a longer-lasting battery. "Basically, I didn't use it that much," said Mr. Stein. "The functionality of the Watch is still pretty limited." There are relatively easy fixes for some concerns. Apple is working on adding cell-network connectivity and a faster processor to its next-generation Watch, according to people familiar with the matter. An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment. ​ Advertisement Other problems run deeper. Forrester Research analyst J.P. Gownder says the Watch isn't useful enough. He expected more businesses to create apps like one from Starwood Hotel & Resorts Worldwide Inc. that lets customers check in, receive a room assignment and unlock a room door without stopping at the front desk. Mr. Gownder said Apple hadn't done enough to build a broader ecosystem of services. "Apple needs to make it an indispensable thing," he said. Still, the Apple Watch has fans who use it daily. According to research firm Wristly, 93% of 1,150 Apple Watch owners in an online survey last week said they were "satisfied" or "very satisfied" with the device. In a sign of how users are personalizing their watches, Apple said in March that a third of users regularly change the bands for the Watch to match their outfits or occasion. "It's become a part of my day," said Dana Strom, a 31-year-old video editor from Santa Monica, Calif., who received the Watch as a gift from his wife in November. "I miss it when I don't have it." He finds notifications and turn-by-turn directions useful, though he grows frustrated at times at how slowly third-party apps run on the Watch. Advertisement The Watch's early struggles in some ways echo the iPhone, now considered a groundbreaking product that accounts for two-thirds of Apple's revenue. The initial model didn't run on the then-fastest wireless network, didn't offer third-party apps and lacked basic functions such as copying and pasting text. As it did with the initial iPhone, Apple in March cut the price for the least-expensive version of the smaller-size Sport Watch model by $50 to $299. Toni Sacconaghi, an analyst with Bernstein Research, estimates Apple has sold 12 million Apple Watches in the first year at an average sales price of $500. Similarly, Neil Cybart, who runs Above Avalon, a site dedicated to analysis of Apple, estimates Apple sold 13 million watches at an average price of $450. Adam	1

The Chinese and Pakistani navies today concluded their two-day naval exercises in the East Sea in which two ships each from both sides took part. This is the first time navies of both the countries conducted exercises in the East Sea which separates and Japan, official media here reported. Two missile ships from each of their fleets took part in the exercises, state-run CCTV reported. The exercises included anti-submarine drills, air defence, anti missile and mock confrontations. Commanders of China and gave instructions in rotation. The Pakistani naval ships Shamsheer and Nasr arrived in on December 28 to take part in joint naval exercises in a bid to boost defence cooperation with their Chinese counterpart. "It is a very significant exercise which will enhance the interoperability and cohesion between the two navies," Bilal Abdul Nasir, Commander ofPakistan's 25th Destroyer Squadron told state-run Global Times. A total of 591 officers and soldiers are on board in the two Pakistani vessels. More than 100 countries and international organisation  gave their support for OBOR project and over 40 countries and international organisations signed agreements or letters of intent to join it, Lu said. Officials say besides Trump, China was also keen on the participation of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. But the Sino-Indian relations were bogged down by China blocking India's move to ban JeM leader Masood Azhar as a global terrorist by the UN like Saeed. China also blocked India's bid for membership in the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG). Over Azhar's issue, China also faced allegations from India of double standards in fighting terrorism. Officials say it is to be seen how much of these issues would figure in China- counter terror talks. Also China is investing vast sums of money into the USD 46 billion China- Economic Corridor (CPEC) which is part of the OBOR over which India has raised objections as it passed through Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK). China was also concerned about stepped up terror attack in its Muslim Uyghur majority Xinjiang province which is also the starting point for OBOR. Chinese and Pakistani border guards have been holding joint patrols to curb infiltration. Afghan government too has raised strong pitch against Pakistan's reluctance to crackdown on the Haqqani network which is creating havoc in Afghanistan, scuttling all moves to restore peace in the war torn country.	1
Brisbane could see 50,000 new inner-city apartments added to skyline, industry expert says Posted Brisbane could soon see 50,000 units added to its skyline, with demand for inner-city apartment living booming in the capital, industry experts say. CommSec's latest State of the States report showed Queensland ranked fourth in the country for dwelling commencements. Property economist Dr Lyndall Bryant, from the Queensland University of Technology, said much of that was due to an apartment boom in Brisbane. "Dwelling commencements is both apartments and detached housing that you might have out in the suburbs, but the boom that we're having at the moment is certainly in the inner-city apartment market," she said. Dr Bryant said the number of apartments being built in Brisbane was "staggering". "There's around 10,000 apartments currently under construction in the Brisbane inner-city," she said. "There's another 15,000 that are approved and another 15,000 apartments waiting for approval, and add to that another 8,000 that are mooted. "Add that all up and that's just shy of 50,000 apartments that potentially could come onto the Brisbane housing market." Bruce Goddard, from Place Projects real estate, said the boom was part of Brisbane's recovery from the global financial crisis (GFC). Brisbane is approximately 50 per cent cheaper than Sydney and 35 to 40 per cent cheaper than Melbourne. Bruce Goddard, Place Projects "Over the GFC there was almost no construction — we had no construction for three or four years," he said. "So there's been a bit of catch up after the financial crisis, and it's that catch up that is showing high volumes now," he said. He said most major residential buildings were going up in West End, South Brisbane, Fortitude Valley and Teneriffe, with young renters increasingly looking to live close to work. But he said the demand was being strongly driven by high property prices in Sydney and Melbourne. "Brisbane is approximately 50 per cent cheaper than Sydney and 35 to 40 per cent cheaper than Melbourne," he said. "International interest is growing reasonably rapidly, but I think we're seeing a lot of Melbourne and Sydney buyers because Melbourne and Sydney are so dear. "We track the differences in values between Brisbane, Sydney and Melbourne, and the difference is now at a record high." Mixed reports over possible oversupply in Brisbane Despite a record number of major residential buildings going up in the city, Mr Goddard said Brisbane was not at risk of having an oversupply of apartments any time soon. "An oversupply means that there are buildings being built, for which there are no tenants," he said. "We are nowhere near that at the moment. As the buildings are being built, there are tenants, so there is good tenant demand, and the tenant demand is driving the buyer demand." But Dr Bryant said she believed Brisbane was nearing its saturation point. "As an industry we need to keep an eye on when the market gets to the saturation point, and I would predict that we are getting very close to point," she said. "There's probably not enough demand to absorb all the supply that is proposed to come onto the market. "If we meet saturation point, which is when demand sort of equals supply, then hopefully market forces would delay further apartments coming on the market. "It is really important for the general economy that the property industry remain buoyant." Topics: building-and-construction, business-economics-and-finance, brisbane-4000, qld, australia	1
What is HopBox? Why is it special? Whether you're a veteran brewer or are brewing your first batch of beer, HopBox homebrewing kits are designed to help you brew in style. Every aspect of brewing is provided for, from quality glassware to the durable, highly-portable handcrafted wooden base. Each kit is built by hand in our Somerville, MA workshop from rustic pine and locally-sourced components. Our home brewing kits are perfect for brewing cider, mead, and - of course - beer. We offer 4 different models, able to brew 1 to 3 gallons of beer at a time (approximately 10-30 beers). Each HopBox homebrewing kit comes fully-equipped with a complete set of instructions, a brewers' log, ingredients*, and a recipe book with over 20 recipes to choose from. Why Kickstarter? We've been refining and perfecting our designs over various iterations, taking feedback from early adopters and our customers. After perfecting our process during the holiday season, we are confident that we're ready to take our operation to the next level to become a fully-functioning business. Now that we've tested our product, we're ready for full-scale production. Which means upgrading our workshop situation. Your donations will go towards renting a bigger, better workshop and helping us to purchase our own tools. With a bigger workshop, we can house our production and shipping comfortably under one roof. What's the plan? In addition to establishing a better home for our business, we'd also like to use our workshop as a communal space where we can share the process of brewing and woodworking with the local community. We'd love for people to come see us build their kits so we can hand the product to them and walk them through their first (or even their hundredth) brew. Our most rewarding days are those spent chatting with other homebrewers, showing them our process and hearing about their latest concoctions. We want to provide a venue for those conversations - tastings, brewing sessions, and everything in between. Our current shop space is small, dark, and cramped, and we don't always have access to the tools that we need--we share them with others who use the space. At the moment, all of our packing, shipping and grain-milling takes place in an apartment. Boxes are stacked to the ceiling, shelves are filled with supplies, and stray packing peanuts litter the floor. It's barely functional as a hobby, and nowhere near what we need to run a business. With your support, we can expand. Growing pains. And in return? REWARDS! We've got rewards for days, including great discounts on all of our homebrewing kits, custom bottle openers and pint glasses, and lots of great swagger to fully outfit you for your next brewing adventure.

We want to provide a venue for those conversations - tastings, brewing sessions, and everything in between. Who's behind HopBox? Two guys with a beer-fueled dream. Mike Langone: I first discovered brewing five years ago. It was love at first brew. However, the brewing process left much to be desired. It was a ungainly process involving ugly plastic fermenters, a messy kitchen and thoroughly disgruntled roommates. I figured there had to be a better way to brew, one that would look at home in any environment and celebrate the process rather than hide it. In January 2013 I designed the first HopBox homebrewing kit. It was everything I wanted a brewing kit to be: stylish, portable, and accessible. I wanted to inspire people to brew, to experiment with new recipes, to feel the satisfaction that comes with sharing something you have made with family and friends. I also realized I wanted to make it more than a hobby - I wanted to make it my career. So I went all in! I quit my day job, emptied my accounts, and started living out my dream - one that I hope you share	1

Winner of the 1984 American Book Award! "...a perfectly marvelous book about the Queen of Sciences, from which one will get a real feeling for what mathematicians do and who they are. The exposition is clear and full of wit and humor..." - The New Yorker (1984 American Book Award Edition) Mathematics has been a human activity for thousands of years. Yet only a few people from the vast population of users are professional mathematicians, who create, teach, foster, and apply it in a variety of situations. The authors of this book believe that it should be possible for these professional mathematicians to explain to non-professionals what they do, what they say they are doing, and why the world should support them at it. They also believe that mathematics should be taught to non-mathematics majors in such a way as to instill an appreciation of the power and beauty of mathematics. Many people from around the world have told the authors that they have done precisely that with the first edition and they have encouraged publication of this revised edition complete with exercises for helping students to demonstrate their understanding. This edition of the book should find a new generation of general readers and students who would like to know what mathematics is all about. It will prove invaluable as a course text for a general mathematics appreciation course, one in which the student can combine an appreciation for the esthetics with some satisfying and revealing applications. The text is ideal for 1) a GE course for Liberal Arts students 2) a Capstone course for perspective teachers 3) a writing course for mathematics teachers.

Sriracha is a tasty hot sauce manufactured by Huy Fong Foods that, for those with adventurous taste buds, makes everything from scrambled eggs to pizza a finer experience. But the process of manufacturing the substance has been unpopular among residents of Irwindale, California, a small town of about 1,400 just twenty miles outside of Los Angeles. And where Irwindale smells a spicy controversy, Texas cities smell spicy opportunity. Sriracha hasn't always been based in Irwindale—the company relocated to the city in 2010, after being offered a sweetheart deal to build a $40 million factory. As the Los Angeles Times reported in November: Huy Fong Foods decided to locate its factory in Irwindale three years ago when the city offered a loan with "irresistable" terms: pay only interest for 10 years, with a balloon payment at the end. Huy Fong took the loan and contributed $250,000 a year to the city of Irwindale each year as part of the deal, Tran said. The company then built a $40-million factory that at full capacity could generate about $300 million a year in sales, according to Tran's statements. The problems started not long after the factory was built. It turns out that the manufacturing process on a spicy sauce (that enjoys what the Times hilariously refers to as "rock star status among condiments"—you're always on the outside looking in, mayonnaise) isn't the most pleasant thing to spend your days around. Reports soon came in about the not-unserious health problems that appeared to be popping up among local residents. The city filed for a lawsuit against the facility to shut down the manufacturing after reports of "burned eyes, inflamed asthma," and an entire birthday party being forced to flee indoors "after the spicy smell descended on the festivities." That sounds like a joke, but in late November, a judge granted a partial injunction. Shortly after the lawsuit against Sriracha manufacturer was filed, Denton city councilman Kevin Roden made a public bid to invite Huy Fong to relocate the facility to his fair North Texas college town. The story continued to develop in recent weeks; Irwindale City Council backed down from its aggressive stance on the substance, voting to delay a decision on whether to declare the factory a public nuisance. And, over here in Texas, San Antonio threw its hat in the "we'd like to host the Sriracha factory" ring. Mario Hernandez, president of San Antonio Economic Development Foundation, said the organization reached out two months ago to Tran, who indicated an expansion is more likely than a full-fledged relocation to the Alamo City, which would cost millions. "We would welcome the opportunity on a complete relocation, but a more likely scenario is future expansion," Hernandez said. San Antonio is an ideal location for production of the spicy condiment because it is close to the Rio Grande Valley, a region with a large agriculture industry that could easily grow chilies for the product, Villalba said. Because the chilies must be transported to a factory for production soon after being harvested, San Antonio, the largest city in South Texas, logistically would be a prime location for a manufacturing plant. The excitement over the opportunity to host the Sriracha factory is all very charming. It's delicious! Texans love hot sauce! But also, the reason that the Sriracha factory is talking relocation is that the current host city is arguing in court that it lowered the quality of life so dramatically that it would rather lose 200 jobs and the tax benefits of hosting a factory that generates $300 million worth of revenue than continue to deal with the asthma/nosebleeds/sinus irritation/canceled birthday parties. All of which suggests that, jobs and tax dollars or no jobs and tax dollars, the eagerness to take this on is a bit weird. It may be, as both Denton and San Antonio officials singing the Sriracha song claim, that those issues that caused such headaches (or nosebleeds) in Irwindale wouldn't affect Denton ("According to Roden, Denton's industrial sites are located 'far away' from residential neighborhoods, so Huy Fong won't need to worry about future lawsuits," our own Joseph Misulonas explained back in November) or San Antonio ("Hernandez and Villalba said they have no reservations about the fumes emitted from the factory because proper steps would be taken to ensure safety of nearby residents," reports MySA.com). It's nice that the cities have thought about it, but it's strange to assume that officials in Irwindale didn't consider any of that when they made their bid to host the factory in recent years. It's possible, of course, that San Antonio and Denton would experience nothing more than an expanded tax base and a boost in jobs if they were to take on the task of hosting the Sr	1
Tipperary 0-14 Dublin 0-12 TIPPERARY MADE HISTORY as they pulled off a remarkable second-half comeback and dethroned All-Ireland U21 football champions Dublin. Tipp scored 11 of their 14 points in the second half to stun the Dubs and book their place in the All-Ireland final for the very first time. Dublin looked to be on course for their second consecutive U21 final after Shane Carty extended their lead to 0-8 to 0-3 just after half time but the Premier County staged a roaring comeback. The first half belonged to Dessie Farrell's men though, with Conor McHugh kicking three points to give the reigning champions a 0-7 to 0-3 advantage at the break. The game began to turn when Josh Keane pointed five minutes into the second half to cut the gap to four. Three more scores followed in the next ten minutes before Cormac Costello hit back for the Dubs to give them a two-point lead. But Tipperary couldn't be denied and further scores from Keane, Jason Lonergan and a Kevin O'Halloran brace saw the Munster champions go in front. Ross Mulcahy and David Byrne swapped scores as the Dubs drew level but Stephen O'Brien engineered a bit of space in front of the posts to put Tiperrary ahead once more in injury time. The champions couldn't respond, and one last O'Halloran free saw the Premier men book their place in their first ever All-Ireland final at the U21 age grade. They will face Tyrone, who beat Roscommon 0-17 to 0-12 in Saturday's second semi-final. Scorers for Tipperary: Kevin O'Halloran 0-4 (3f), Josh Keane 0-3 (3f), Steven O'Brien, Colin O'Riordan 0-2 each, Ross Mulcahy, Liam Casey, Jason Lonergan 0-1 each.

President-elect Donald Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence during a visit to a Carrier factory. Evan Vucci/AP Photo It's not an exaggeration to say that Elon Musk and Donald Trump have the most diametric brains on the planet. They also differ widely in their views on a hot-button political issue: climate change. The Tesla CEO is the world's most prominent proponent of using innovation to do something about global warming, while the president-elect has said climate change is a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese. But with the opening on Wednesday of Tesla's battery manufacturing factory in Nevada, Musk has suddenly wound up with a "surprising alignment of interests with the new presidential administration," says Adam Jonas, Morgan Stanley's lead auto analyst. Jonas, one of the most strident Tesla bulls on Wall Street, made the comment in a research note in which he assessed the Gigafactory's opening and reiterated his view that the company's Model 3 mass-market vehicle won't launch on schedule at the end of 2017. But the alignment "really seemed to sneak up on people," he added. Of course it did — until you think about where the two line up. Tesla's a high-tech domestic hiring machine. Here's Jonas, writing about the Nevada plant: "As the bus drove up to the massive plant yesterday morning, one could not help but notice the hundreds of cars in the parking lot from the construction crew (yes, roughly 1/2 of the vehicles were pickup trucks), part of 2,100 construction workers running two shifts per day. "To the extent that the creation of high-tech manufacturing jobs in the United States is a priority of the incoming administration, we believe Mr. Musk might have some interests that could be very much in alignment with those of President-elect Trump." Old versus new manufacturing It's worth pointing out that the Obama administration was also supportive of high-tech manufacturing and that it's unclear whether all US manufacturing jobs are equal in the eyes of Trump and the GOP. And don't forget that constructing Tesla's Nevada Gigafactory involved old-school labor, while the manufacturing of battery cells inside could eventually be almost completely automated. But Jonas is onto something by highlighting what could be an unexpected and potentially awkward shared interest of Trump and Musk. The Tesla CEO did, after all, make the pilgrimage to Trump Tower along with the rest of the Silicon Valley tech elite. However, all of Musk's companies require a type of government support that's futuristic rather than retro. Electric cars are a threat to the oil business. Solar power — Tesla just acquired SolarCity — has benefitted from government subsidies to gain a foothold against traditional grid electricity provided by burning coal and natural gas. SpaceX has NASA as its biggest customer. Musk is a shining example of a businessperson who's making America great now. It remains to be seen if Trump can digest that reality and come to terms with how that reality has been achieved.	1
Martin Harris Pageant Cast Members Are Performers, Missionaries Contributed By Rachel Sterzer, Church News staff writer Article Highlights Clarkston has been the home of the Martin Harris pageant since 1983. It depicts the life of Martin Harris, who became one of the Three Witnesses to testify of the divine origin of the Book of Mormon. Close to 36,000 visitors traveled to Clarkston to watch the pageant. "Every time I step out on stage I get chills. I feel the Spirit every time. I know Martin saw what he saw because I feel it every time." —Brad Noble, actor playing Martin Harris CLARKSTON, UTAH Clarkston—population of about 670 at the last census—is nestled in the northwest part of Utah's Cache Valley. Its patchwork of gold and green fields are fringed by views of the mountains on each side. Directions to Clarkston often include the warning that the nearest gas station is 15 to 20 miles away. There is no grocery store. Yet from July 31 to August 15, this remote farming town received close to 36,000 visitors. That's because since 1983, Clarkston has been the home of Martin Harris: The Man Who Knew, a pageant that depicts the life of Martin Harris, who became one of the Three Witnesses to testify of the divine origin of the Book of Mormon. The events leading up to the first publication of the Book of Mormon and Martin's role in those events are presented in an outdoor amphitheater adjacent to where Martin is buried in the Clarkston cemetery. Included in those events is the incident involving the 116 manuscript pages of the Book of Mormon where, in June of 1828, after Martin's repeated entreaties, Joseph Smith allowed him to take the pages to show his family. Unfortunately, through Martin's negligence, the pages were lost. Both Martin and Joseph were reprimanded. Brad Noble, who played the role of Martin Harris in the last two productions, said one of the big themes of the pageant is that of forgiveness and repentance. "There's a line that I love at the end of the play where Joseph explains to Martin that we all need forgiveness and it's Christ's Atonement that does that for each and every one of us," said Brother Noble. Not only is Martin forgiven, but he also becomes one of three men allowed to see the angel Moroni display the gold plates. After the witnesses saw and handled the plates, a voice from heaven declared that the record was true and had been translated correctly. Each performance begins with the testimony of the Three Witnesses that is now included in the foreword of the Book of Mormon. Brother Noble said, "Every time [I speak those words]—from the first time we did it in rehearsal and every time I step out on stage—I get chills. I feel the Spirit every time. I know Martin saw what he saw because I feel it every time." The hour-and-fifteen-minute production is staged every odd year with a cast of about 80, with 150 volunteers. Cast members put in long hours of rehearsals and performances. However, many cast members are quick to note the blessings. "This pageant is a smorgasbord, and, if you allow yourself, it is an absolute feast," said Jeff Richins, who played Joseph Smith Sr. in this year's production but has also played the part of Martin Harris and other roles. "You can't have an experience like this every night and not want to put yourself back in that environment." Prior to each performance, cast members spent time talking with visitors, often answering questions about their character or about Joseph Smith and the Restoration. Brother Richins took the opportunity during every show to give away a copy of the Book of Mormon, in which he had written his testimony. Many other cast members reported similar experiences throughout the three-week performance schedule. "We're here to perform, but we're also here to be missionaries," explained Maggie Porter, who was part of this year's ensemble cast. "This is my own little mission." Terra Smith, who played Lucy Mack Smith, the mother of the Prophet Joseph Smith, has participated in various ways in the pageant for more than a decade. The pageant has provided an opportunity for her to strengthen not only her own testimony but also the testimonies of her children, now ages 14, 13, and 12. "It's been a wonderful opportunity for [my children] to not only learn the story of Martin Harris and the story of how the Book of Mormon was first published and how it really came to be, but it also gives them an opportunity to really understand what missionary work is and to have that personal testimony built for themselves as well." Travis and Angela Parry and their five children, ranging from age 11 to 2, all participated in the pageant together and made it a goal for each	1
Previous Chapter | Index | Next Chapter Chapter 61: Strength and reward. Translated by: chua Edited by: TN and Elkassar The Overlord sped past the clouds at breakneck speed, entering straight into space within seconds. Then like a drizzle against water, it gradually faded away, with only Sheyan and Reef left behind. They seem to be trapped inside a formless screen, their surrounding the mysterious pitch-black universe, the mystical nebula with twinkling stars. Beneath them, was the titanous yellow-earth backdrop of the planet. Because they had entered this world as a temporary party, thus, the ending of this story was similar. Following that, was naturally the battlefield overview reflection. Firstly, the screen shone with the encounters of Reef and the other bunch of contestants when accomplishing the main mission. The crazed resistance against the arachnids in Steel Whip base….encountering a flaming beetle on the way to Whisky base….reuniting with the Roughnecks…..finally, the deaths of Johnny Rico and the other main storyline characters. Next, Sheyan's reflection of events were much lesser. Obviously, his unorthodox path led to his abandonment of the main mission. His first reflection was the moment he killed that gigantic scourge back in Steep Whip base. The second was fast-forwarded to the moment he reached the tragic scene of the main character. The third was the emotional explosion of the Tyrannical Spore Colony. The battle summary finally concluded. The realm flashed out the following information: Time: Galaxy era. Year 383, April 17th. 10 am in the morning. Location: Planet P, sixth district, Steep Whip human base. (Latitude: 43.19 degrees. Longitude: 91.02 degrees) Setting: Starship Troopers Difficulty: Mid (C grade) Pain limitator: 30% Individual capability enhancement: 0% Current setting exploration rate: 7.2% Main mission: Failed Mission theory exploration rate: 41% Mission completion score: D (Main mission failed / only met the basic requirements of Lieutenant Colonel Dundee's mission) Note: You possess 1 legend level, you will receive additional bonus. Setting completion reward: Free attribute points: 1+1 points (Because of legend level). Requirements not met to receive utility points or potential points. Current free attribute points: 2 points. You can freely add the free attribute points to your basic attributes (Strength/agility etc), using it to enhance your body. Seeing this string of notifications, Sheyan quietly glanced towards Reef and shrugged his shoulders. Reef sighed and said. "Such an arduous main mission for this mid difficulty setting…..indeed it is a little too demanding of a temporary constructed party. But if everyone had worked and cooperated together, especially you Seaman. If you could've displayed your schemes right at the start, we would've been able to succeed." Sheyan shrugged his shoulders, sincerely replying. "Let's not talk about others. If I had tried to give orders at the start, would you have been convinced?" Reef was stunned, sighing, sighing again as he shook his head and sighed once more. Then he forced out a smile. Sheyan patted Reef's shoulder and continued. "No matter what, we still managed to survive, that itself is enough. What are your plans from now?" Reef raised his eyes to observe Sheyan, then he gently replied. "Why? Trying to recruit me?" Sheyan bluntly replied. "That's right. If I missed out on you, or you missed out on me, wouldn't we regret next time?" Reef earnestly replied.

Reef shook his head. "This world is filled with evil, but we cannot be influenced by it. Instead, we must cleanse it!" Sheyan suddenly asked. "You should be of an European nobility origin in the present world right?" Reef snorted coldly. "That's right! Are you going to follow that up with the stereotype, horse rider,	1
Microsoft Sells Dell's Venue 8 Pro Tablet For $99 You're unlikely to find a better Windows 8 tablet deal. How does Dell's tablet stack up to the iPad? On Monday, for one day only, Microsoft's online store and retail locations will sell Dell's Venue 8 Pro Windows 8.1 tablet for $99, an eye-opening $200 off the new device's regular price. If you've been on the fence about buying a Windows tablet this holiday season, you're unlikely to find many deals better than this one. Dell's 8-inch slate isn't the first mini-tablet to run the full version of Windows, including desktop apps. But earlier efforts, such as Acer's Iconia W3, were hampered by cheap hardware and slow processors, to say nothing of Windows 8's rough edges and infamous learning curve. Dell's Venue line, in contrast, has been generally well-received. Forrester analyst David Johnson told InformationWeek in October that the devices are compelling options that compare favorably to more expensive and ballyhooed options, such as Microsoft's Surface tablets. But you'll have to act fast if you want in on this deal. The offer is good only on Monday, and each Microsoft location will sell only twenty Venue 8 Pros at $99. After that, the devices will sell for $199 - still a pretty good deal - until inventory is depleted. Microsoft's online store will offer the Venue 8 Pro for $99 to the first 100 customers. After that, the cost shifts to $199 for the rest of the day or while supplies last. [ Buying a tablet this holiday season? Read Tablet Shopping Guide: 8 Tips. ] The promotion is available only to customers in the United States, Canada and Puerto Rico. Each customer is also limited to one device. In limited use, I've found the Venue 8 Pro to be snappy and responsive. Its quad-core "Bay Trail" processor is a noticeable improvement over previous Intel Atom chips, and though its screen doesn't boast the resolution of some competing options, the device's 1200x800-pixel display is still quite decent. Dell's Venue 8 Pro supports stylus and keyboard accessories. Windows 8.1 is also a major improvement over Windows 8. The update's app-snapping multi-tasking function is particularly welcome on an 8-inch display because it allows users to split the screen evenly between two apps. In the original version of Windows 8, one app had to occupy three-quarters of the display, which made multi-tasking impractical on smaller tablets. Other Venue 8 Pro appeals include a preloaded copy of Office Home & Student 2013, 32 GB of storage and 2 GB of RAM. It also includes a Micro USB port and can run for up to 10 hours between charges. Are there any reasons not to take advantage of this sale? A few. For starters, buying a Windows 8.1 tablet isn't the same as buying an Android or iOS tablet. They're all fine for accessing the Web, sending email or watching Netflix, but if you're looking for an expanded ecosystem of touch-first apps, iOS and Android still set the standard. Windows 8.1's app store isn't as impoverished as it was once, but the Venue 8 Pro's major sales draw isn't touch apps; it's support for desktop software, particularly Microsoft Office. Does this make the Venue 8 Pro more productive than an iPad? It depends. The Venue 8 Pro offers stylus support and can connect to third-party keyboards via Bluetooth. Dell also plans to release its own keyboard accessory soon. These tools will be useful to some, but desktop software will provide only so much utility running on such a small form factor. The Venue 8 Pro won't replace a laptop, but it could be a terrific secondary device for work. Display resolution might be another concern. The Venue 8 Pro's screen is serviceable-- but it's also put to shame by the new iPad Mini's 2048x1536-pixel Retina display. Some might also be bothered by the awkward placement of the Start button; many Windows tablets place the button beneath the screen, in the middle of the bottom bezel, but Dell counter-intuitively positioned the button on the device's top-right edge. Other might be peeved that the device's 10-hour battery life can only be achieved if the screen brightness is turned down; otherwise, the battery runs closer to eight hours. The Venue 8 Pro also lacks an HDMI port for connecting the tablet to a monitor or television, though Windows 8.1's native Miracast support somewhat mitigates this concern. But given that the device is being offered at such extreme discounts, most of these concerns are minor quibbles. And if you miss out on the Venue 8 Pro 8, don't	1

Image copyright EPA Image caption Hungarian troops patrol a razor-wire fence on the Serbian border to keep migrants out The leaders of the Czech Republic and Hungary say a "joint European army" is needed to bolster security in the EU. They were speaking ahead of talks in Warsaw with German Chancellor Angela Merkel. They dislike her welcome for Muslim migrants from outside the EU. Hungary's Prime Minister Viktor Orban said "we must give priority to security, so let's start setting up a joint European army". The UK government has strongly opposed any such moves outside Nato's scope. The Czech, Hungarian, Polish and Slovak leaders are coordinating their foreign policy as the "Visegrad Group". Czech Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka said building a joint European army would not be easy, but he called for discussion to start on it. The EU has joint defence capabilities in the form of 1,500-strong battle groups, but they have not been tested in combat yet. Last year European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker called for a European army to give the EU muscle in confronting threats from Russia or elsewhere. Post-Brexit planning Slovakia will host an informal EU summit on 16 September to consider the EU's future without the UK. No UK minister will attend, as the Conservative government is preparing the ground for Brexit, in line with the 23 June vote to leave the 28-nation bloc. "Brexit is not just an event like any other - it's a turning-point in the EU's history, so we have to frame a careful response," Mrs Merkel said. Germany wants the Visegrad countries to help house refugees from conflict zones, especially Syria, Iraq and Eritrea, but they oppose an EU quota system. Germany took in more than a million non-EU migrants last year - a record influx. New Hungary fence Hungary and Slovakia are suing the European Commission at the European Court of Justice (ECJ), calling its quota scheme for distributing refugees illegal. Hungary will hold a referendum on 2 October aimed at showing majority opposition to quotas. Mr Orban announced plans on Friday to build a second razor-wire fence, taller and stronger than the first, along Hungary's southern border with Serbia. The second fence would be to keep out any future wave of migrants arriving from the Balkans. The BBC's Nick Thorpe in Budapest says Hungary currently allows around 30 people a day through two transit zones built into the existing fence. Migrants live in wretched conditions beside the fence, waiting to be allowed through, he reports. Others pay people smugglers, who bribe police on both the Serbian and Hungarian side. A note on terminology: The BBC uses the term migrant to refer to all people on the move who have yet to complete the legal process of claiming asylum. This group includes people fleeing war-torn countries such as Syria, who are likely to be granted refugee status, as well as people who are seeking jobs and better lives, who governments are likely to rule are economic migrants.	1
Syracuse, N.Y. -- One of Bernie Fine's accusers initially told Syracuse police the former Syracuse University coach molested him in early 2002 while he was attending an away game against the University of Connecticut, Onondaga County District Attorney William Fitzpatrick said today. But Fitzpatrick said that after law enforcement authorities discovered that SU never played UConn during the 2001-02 season, Zach Tomaselli changed his story. Tomaselli then told police that Fine sexually abused him in a Pittsburgh hotel room in January 2002, the night before SU played Pittsburgh, Fitzpatrick said, questioning Tomaselli's credibility. Tomaselli fired back today that Fitzpatrick's account is not true. He said that he initially told a police dispatcher that Fine molested him after inviting him to an away rivalry game, possibly against Connecticut. But within 24 hours, a friend, whom Tomaselli would not identify, reminded him that he had gone to Pittsburgh to see SU play, he said.  "I was 13 at the time. I had been in the northeast less than three or four months. That was not something I remembered, the specific city. I did once I thought about it," Tomaselli said. "The minute I actually thought about it I knew it was Pittsburgh. One hundred percent." Minutes later, Tomaselli said, "I don't think I ever told the police it was in Connecticut. I'm 90 percent sure I did not even tell Connecticut to a police dispatcher. That 10 percent, I might have said it was a rivalry game, possibly Connecticut." Tomaselli, 23, is the only known accuser of Fine whose allegations could possibly result in a prosecution because of the statute of limitations, according to prosecutors and legal experts. Tomaselli said he recalled that Fine had invited him to watch an away game in Pittsburgh - not in Connecticut - before police detectives met him and questioned him about the incident. He said he never knew that SU did not play UConn in the 2001-02 season until a Post-Standard reporter questioned him today. No police officials ever confronted him about that fact, Tomaselli said. Fine, 66, who was fired by SU in November after three men publicly accused him of molesting them as children, has not been charged with any crimes. Through his attorneys, Fine has maintained he did nothing wrong. Assistant U.S. Attorney Steve Clymer, who is overseeing the investigation of Fine, declined to comment today on Fitzpatrick's assertions. The spokesman for the Syracuse Police Department, whose detectives interviewed Tomaselli, did not respond to a request for comment. Fitzpatrick's office initially launched an investigation of the sexual abuse allegations against Fine. But Fitzpatrick announced Dec. 7 that he was ending his investigation because no crimes had occurred in Onondaga County within the statute of limitations and the U.S. Attorney's office was taking over the case.

Some musicians are so idiosyncratic and distinctive that you can pick out their sound anywhere: Mark Knopfler and Jerry Garcia on guitar, Flea on bass, Stevie Nicks on vocals, and Trent Reznor on, well, everything. It turns out that programmers are the same way. "Stylometry," which helps identify creators through the study of the person's style was first applied to music, then to fine art. Now some researchers—led by Aylin Caliskan-Islam, a PhD student at Drexel University—have recently discovered that this technique can be applied to code as well to determine who programmed it. "Every developer has preferences not only for things like spacing (spaces vs tabs), naming styles (CamelCase vs. snake_case) and commenting, but also how he or she implements certain types of functionality," explains Phil Johnson in ITWorld. Other traits that that the researchers used included layout (such as the white space in the program) and lexical attributes (for example, counts of various types of tokens), Johnson explains. "Their real innovation, though, was in developing what they call 'abstract syntax trees' which are similar to parse trees for sentences, and are derived from language-specific syntax and keywords," he continues. "These trees capture a syntactic feature set which, the authors wrote, 'was created to capture properties of coding style that are completely independent from writing style.'" In other words, "Programmers can obfuscate their variable or function names, but not the structures they subconsciously prefer to use or their favorite increment operators," the researchers say in a lecture about the project. The technique was developed by gathering publicly available C++ source code from seven years' worth of Google's Code Jam, an annual programming competition that attracts a wide range of programmers—more than 100,000 in total. Eventually, they achieved a 95 percent success rate, Johnson writes, which rises to 97 percent as the code sample sizes increase. The more complex the programming problem, the better success researchers had in identifying the coder, he adds. Of course success first requires having a known database of programmers and their code with which to compare it. This was apparently left as an exercise for the reader. Why is this a big deal? Does it really matter who wrote some piece of code? It does when you consider that stylometry could be used to help identify the author of malicious source code. It might also help resolve plagiarism and copyright disputes. "Source code authorship attribution could provide proof of authorship in court, automate the process of finding a cyber criminal from the source code left in an infected system, or aid in resolving copyright, copyleft and plagiarism issues in the programming fields," the researchers write. Less seriously, it could also be used in computer programming classes to determine whether students are cheating on the assignments. Stylometry is also being considered as a security method by organizations such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency and the U.S. Army—where, incidentally, Caliskan-Islam served as a visiting researcher. In fact, this research could put some programmers at risk, the researchers warn. Programmers could now be identified when they contribute to an open-source project—which could get sticky when they don't want their employer to know. It also becomes risky to work on something embarrassing—or dangerous. "An Iranian programmer was sentenced to death in 2012 for developing photo sharing software that was used on pornographic websites," researchers note. "Sadly but predictably, there is virtually no technical difference between security-enhancing and privacy-infringing use cases."	1
Buy Photo Tiffany Compton, 29, Indianapolis, hunts with her hunting dog Oakley at Goose Pond Fish and Wildlife Area near Linton on Dec. 6. (Photo: Ryan Sabalow/The Star)Buy Photo Tiffany Compton is a former police officer. She has worked as a guard in an all-male lockup inside a state prison. She knows how to use deadly force and take down bad guys twice her size. But when Compton, 29, recently found herself alone and intimidated on a recent morning, it wasn't at the hands of hardened criminals. It was a group of duck hunters. The Indianapolis woman had walked into a wildlife area office to sign up for her first public-lands duck hunt. She was the only woman in a room full of camouflaged men. Immediately, she felt the stares. And then, with her back turned, she heard words that made her cringe. It was a father talking to his son. "As I'm looking at the map," Compton recalled, "I can hear the dad chuckle, and he says (to his son), 'I know what you're looking at.' " Women are increasingly making inroads into traditionally male-dominated hunting and shooting sports. Still, stories such as Compton's are common — and they illustrate a troubling hurdle for hunting groups, wildlife agencies and outdoor retailers seeking recruits to a sport that isn't growing. Based on surveys conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau, the number of U.S. hunters has largely stayed flat or declined in recent years, a factor hunting associations and wildlife officials blame at least in part to increased urbanization. The trend poses a particular challenge for state wildlife agencies, whose funding is almost entirely dependent on fishing and hunting license fees and taxes on hunting and shooting equipment. "The very last thing you want to do is make a new hunter feel uncomfortable in a scenario like you described when she's simply trying to draw for a blind," said Nick Pinizzotto, president and CEO of the U.S. Sportsmen's Alliance, a hunting and shooting lobbying group. "Women hunting is the best thing that could happen to our sport." After all, he said, female hunters — or even women who might be merely supportive of hunting — are key allies at the voting booth or in public policy debates about hunting and gun-rights issues. 'Be prepared to deal with that sexism' Of the 13.7 million hunters in the U.S. in 2011, 11 percent were women — and that's up from 9 percent since 2001. Women also make up a growing demographic among firearms owners. For example, the number of women with gun permits in Indiana jumped 42.6 percent since 2012 — from 86,617 permits two years ago to 123,536 through the first quarter of this year. The National Rifle Association estimated that about 25 percent of 70,000 attendees at its Indianapolis convention this year were women. With female hunters and shooters on the rise, companies have taken notice. Women now increasingly host big-game hunting cable television shows; outdoor retailers have begun marketing products and gear designed for women; and one of the nation's most venerable hunting magazines, Field & Stream, recently put a female hunter on its cover. But Compton's story and several others that female hunters told The Indianapolis Star illustrate the depth of the problems women face from some male hunters. Women shared with The Star not only tales of sexism and mere rudeness, but disturbing examples of sexual harassment in the field, at outdoors retailers and at conferences. "Men need to be involved in changing that climate," said Nadya Fouad, a professor at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee who has studied barriers to minorities and women entering workplaces dominated by white men. "That's going to take some time. Meanwhile, women need to be prepared to deal with that sexism." 'It is a lot of sexual comments sometimes' Morgan Born knows a thing or two about that. The 20-year-old mother from Lake County says she basically taught herself, a female friend and her boyfriend how to hunt ducks. But in spite of being as skilled as any man in the duck blind, she said, there are some public duck hunting areas near her home where she won't go because "a little circle of men" have repeatedly made her feel uncomfortable or were rude to her and her female hunting partner. "It gets kind of weird at times," Born said. "You get a lot of comments like, 'I wish you would come in our blind.' It's like, 'Oh my God.' It is a lot of sexual comments sometimes." Terri Millefoglie, a conservation officer with the Indiana Department of Natural Resources, said now that she's an officer with a gun and a badge, male hunters are much more respectful, but she remembers what it was like being the only woman signing in at public hunting	1

Abstract The condition of congenital amusia, commonly known as tone‐deafness, has been described for more than a century, but has received little empirical attention. In the present study, a research effort has been made to document in detail the behavioural manifestations of congenital amusia. A group of 11 adults, fitting stringent criteria of musical disabilities, were examined in a series of tests originally designed to assess the presence and specificity of musical disorders in brain‐damaged patients. The results show that congenital amusia is related to severe deficiencies in processing pitch variations. The deficit extends to impairments in music memory and recognition as well as in singing and the ability to tap in time to music. Interestingly, the disorder appears specific to the musical domain. Congenital amusical individuals process and recognize speech, including speech prosody, common environmental sounds and human voices, as well as control subjects. Thus, the present study convincingly demonstrates the existence of congenital amusia as a new class of learning disabilities that affect musical abilities. Introduction Language and music have many similarities. Notably, language and music are universal and specific to humans. Despite the complex abilities involved in both domains, linguistic and musical competence develop in the child spontaneously, without conscious effort or formal instruction. However, a few individuals suffer from severe language acquisition impairments, which are not consequent to any hearing deficiency, mental retardation or lack of environmental stimulation (e.g. Benton, 1964; Gopnik and Crago, 1991). Such a specific language impairment affects between 3 and 6% of the population (e.g. Wrightet al., 1997). Considering the similarities between music and language, we can expect that a similar proportion of individuals from the general population experience music‐specific impairments. Affected individuals would be born without the essential wiring elements for the development of a normally functioning system for music. This condition is variously termed tune‐deafness, tone‐deafness, dysmelodia or dysmusia in the literature. However, we prefer to refer to this learning disability with the less restrictive label of 'congenital amusia', because there may be as many different forms of developmental amusias as there are varieties of acquired amusias that result from accidental brain damage in adulthood. Congenital amusia is a condition that has been known for more than a century, since the pioneering study published by Grant‐Allen in 1878. Grant‐Allen reports the case of a 30‐year‐old man with a solid education and without neurological lesion, who suffers from a severe musical handicap. The man was unable to discriminate the pitch of two successive tones, failed to recognize familiar melodies and could not carry a tune. He exhibited an overall indifference towards music. Yet, the musical defect could not be explained by a lack of exposure to music since the man had received musical lessons during childhood (Grant‐Allen, 1879). A century later, Geshwind published a similar case (Geshwind, 1984). The case was a man who came from a musically impaired family, despite their frequent exposure to recorded music at home. As a child, this man attempted piano lessons, but his teacher soon realized that he could not sing, nor discriminate between two pitches and could not keep time. Interestingly, this same subject could speak three foreign languages fluently. Though indicative, these two studies are anecdotal since they are descriptive and not supported by systematic evaluations. Two large‐scale studies were run to quantify the musical disorder. In 1948, Fry evaluated a 1200 subject sample on tests requiring the subjects to compare two notes or two musical phrases in order to detect a change in pitch. From these results, Fry estimated that 5% of the British population were amusical. This author further argued that musical memory problems as well as a difficulty in pitch discrimination might be the major determinants of congenital amusia (Fry, 1948). However, these claims were not supported by data analyses. More recently, Kalmus and Fry ran another large‐scale study with 604 unselected adults who were required to detect anomalous pitches inserted in melodies (Kalmus and Fry, 1980). From these results, 4.2% of the British adult population were estimated to be amusical. However, this estimate is problematic. First, the measure lacks sensitivity since >90% of the participants were performing at ceiling. Secondly, a single measure of musical ability may have both poor validity and poor reliability. Above all, such a psychometric definition of congenital amusia is unconvincing because the sole consideration of one tail of the normal distribution on a single test does not provide convincing evidence that congenital amusia is a real affliction and not a statistical anomaly. In summary, previous studies of congenital amusia provide valuable information regarding the nature of congenital amusia, while they do not offer a solid empirical basis. Thus, the major objective of the present study	1
Start up the chorus of grumbling and shine up your best "What in the what now?" faces: AT&T has just added a $0.61 monthly administrative fee to wireless customers' bills. It's totally great for AT&T of course, as reports indicate the move could bring in about $518 million in extra moolah for the company in 2014. So, yay for you, AT&T? Heralded as the "Mobility Administrative Fee," the new tariff actually went into effect May 1. Don't feel bad if you didn't notice, because we didn't either. Anyone with Consumer and Individual Responsibility User (IRU) lines should see this fee tacked on. But what is the fee for, anyway? And should we be grumpy about it? Grump as much as you want, but AT&T claims it's necessary to help "defray certain expenses AT&T incurs, including but not limited to: (a) charges AT&T or its agents pay to interconnect with other carriers to deliver calls from AT&T customers to their customers; and (b) charges associated with cell site rents and maintenance." An AT&T spokesperson defends the new charge by telling CNET it's "consistent with similar fees charged by other carriers." To that end, Sprint and Verizon charge $1.50 and 90-cent administrative fees, respectively. Some readers are wondering, and appropriately so, whether this surcharge will allow them to get out of their AT&T contracts without an ETF. It doesn't seem so, as Consumerist reader Eli writes that the common response to that question has been that because it's a fee and not a rate change, it doesn't count. He says he was told by the Death Star itself: "The rate for the service is the same, ie if it was $69 a month before, it's still $69 now. There's just a new fee, which isn't the same thing as a higher rate." Oh, okay…?	1
GREAT FALLS, Mont. (AP) -- A Montana bow hunter is recovering after he survived a grizzly bear mauling by remembering a tip from his grandmother and shoving his arm down the animal's throat. Chase Dellwo, 26, was hunting with his brother northwest of the town of Choteau on Saturday when he came face-to-face with a 350- to 400-pound male grizzly, the Great Falls Tribune reported. Dellwo was walking up a creek bed, hoping to drive a herd of elk to a ridge where his brother was waiting. He was only 3 feet from the bear when he noticed it. He said the grizzly had been sleeping and didn't see him coming, possibly because of the snow, rain and 30 to 40 mph winds. Dellwo said he only had time to take a few steps back before the bear knocked him off his feet and bit his head. "He let go, but he was still on top of me roaring the loudest roar I have ever heard," Dellwo said. The bear then bit Dellwo's leg and shook him, tossing him in the air. As the bear came at the man again, Dellwo recalled a story he read in a magazine. "I remembered an article that my grandmother gave me a long time ago that said large animals have bad gag reflexes," he said. "So I shoved my right arm down his throat." The advice worked, and the bear left. Dellwo rejoined his brother, who drove him to a hospital. Dellwo received stitches and staples in his head, some on his face, a swollen eye and deep puncture wounds on his leg. "I want everyone to know that it wasn't the bear's fault. He was as scared as I was," Dellwo said.	1
Democratic state Sen. Roderick D. Wright, convicted earlier this year on felony perjury and voting fraud charges, was sentenced Friday to 90 days in county jail and banned for life from holding public office. Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Kathleen Kennedy also sentenced the senator to three years' probation and 1,500 hours of community service. He must also pay $2,000 in restitution. He is scheduled to begin serving his sentence Oct. 31. Wright, 62, who represents an Inglewood-area district, was convicted in January on eight felony counts in a case that centered on whether he had lied to qualify for office.

"Paint it (Vanta) black" - the world's blackest material is now in spray form * new applications include consumer products such as cameras, and luxury goods * new applications include consumer products such as cameras, and luxury goods Newhaven, UK, March 11, 2016 --- A whole range of products can now take advantage of Vantablack's astonishing characteristics, thanks to the development of a new spray version of the world's blackest coating material. The new substance, Vantablack S-VIS, is easily applied at large scale to virtually any surface, whilst still delivering the proven performance of Vantablack. Vantablack's nano-structure absorbs virtually all incident light, enabling the performance of precision optical systems to be optimized. The material's developer, UK-based Surrey NanoSystems, has mimicked the performance of its original Vantablack with a new version that can be sprayed onto objects, rather than deposited using a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) process. Vantablack S-VIS greatly widens the potential applications space, making it possible to coat larger complex shapes and structures. It is applied at temperatures that are easily withstood by common plastics, further extending its use. Even though the material is applied using a simple spraying process, it traps a massive 99.8% of incident light. This property gives Vantablack S-VIS its ability to make objects appear to be two-dimensional black holes, as it becomes impossible to make-out surface topography. The only other commercially-available material that is darker than the new S-VIS version is original Vantablack, which set a world record for absorption of light at a staggering 99.965%. Vantablack was originally developed for satellite-borne earth observation imaging and calibration systems, where it increases instrument sensitivity by improving absorption of stray ultraviolet, visible and infrared light. Since then, many other applications have emerged, including solar-energy collector elements, functional surfaces in buildings and architecture, cinematographic projectors, high-performance baffles and lenses, and scientific instruments. Its ability to deceive the eye also opens-up a range of design-possibilities to enhance styling and appearance in luxury goods and jewellery. "The original Vantablack coating has had a big impact on the market, and is helping many companies to bring out higher-performing equipment," says Ben Jensen of Surrey NanoSystems. "We are continuing to develop the technology, and the new sprayable version really does open up the possibility of applying super-black coatings in many more types of airborne or terrestrial applications. Possibilities include commercial products such as cameras, equipment requiring improved performance in a smaller form factor, as well as differentiating the look of products by means of the coating's unique aesthetic appearance. It's a major step forward compared with today's commercial absorber coatings." Vantablack S-VIS is so effective that its performance far outstrips that of any other conventionally-applied coating, typically achieving a reflectance of less than 0.2%. Unlike other black absorbers, it offers this exceptional performance across a wide-range of viewing angles and wavelengths, which is critical for optical instruments, as well as in many aesthetic applications. It is, for example, some 17 times less reflective than the super-black paint used for minimizing stray light in the Hubble space telescope. The active element of Vantablack S-VIS is a carbon nanotube matrix. The coating is applied using a proprietary process that includes a number of pre- and post-application steps to achieve its ultra-low reflectance. Vantablack S-VIS can be applied to most stable surfaces, with the only major constraint being the ability to withstand temperatures of 100 degrees Centigrade, making Vantablack S-VIS suitable for many types of engineering-grade polymers and composite materials. The process is scalable and suitable for high-volume production on a range of substrate sizes. The structured surface of Vantablack S-VIS means that it is not recommended for applications where it is subject to physical contact or abrasion. Ideally, it should be applied to surfaces that are protected, either within a packaged product, or behind a glass or other protective layer. Coating with Vantablack S-VIS is offered as a service from Surrey NanoSystems' processing centre in the UK. It is also available under license to companies wishing to integrate the coating into their production processes.

CINCINNATI -- It's been more than 60 years since legendary actress and singer Doris Day lived in Cincinnati, yet she stole the show last month during a Cincinnati City Council meeting. Councilman P.G. Sittenfeld led a 25-minute presentation, displaying life-size photos of the smiling superstar at City Hall and playing a video presentation on the Cincinnati native's life for fellow council members. And 25 minutes later, council voted to rename a city street in her honor – Doris Day Way. It was a sentimental gesture to recognize a famous Cincinnatian. But it is also an increasingly common way for City Council to spend its time as Election Day nears. So far in 2017, as most of council faces re-election, it has renamed 20 streets to celebrate history or honor notable residents such as Buddy LaRosa and Bootsy Collins. Meanwhile bigger issues, such as what to do about the dilapidated Police District 5 and the number of cancer diagnoses of officers who work there, seem to simmer without much attention. The Doris Day presentation came just a day after another officer had been diagnosed with cancer while city leaders delayed plans to move officers from the troubled District 5 building for months. It prompted Hamilton County Republican Party Chair Alex Triantafilou to tweet "While @CityOfCincy PD faces a real crisis in Dist. 5, your council is enjoying pictures of Doris Day. Get Serious." While @CityOfCincy PD faces a real crisis in Dist. 5, your council is enjoying pictures of Doris Day. Get serious. — Alex Triantafilou (@ChairmanAlex) September 27, 2017 With the election weeks away, and six of the nine council members running for re-election, WCPO examined the number of resolutions it passed that don't change city policy in any way. For example, in 2017, City Council passed 17 resolutions voicing their opinions on a range of state and national topics, such as the repeal of the Affordable Care Act and the nation's withdrawal from the Paris Climate agreement. Councilman Charlie Winburn chided his fellow council members for spending the bulk of a 28-minute meeting in September talking about President Donald Trump's order to end a policy allowing children of immigrants to stay in the United States legally. He ticked off a number of issues – from the streetcar's operating budget to the heroin epidemic – that City Council should spend time on instead. "Our time is better spent on these issues," Winburn said. "We are not being fair to Cincinnatians when we focus on taking symbolic stands on national issues." Councilman Charles Winburn speaks during a Cincinnati City Council meeting on Oct. 18, 2017. Photo by Leigh Taylor And taking a stance on national issues – particularly with a controversial president like Trump -- can be a good way for some council members to win favor with their base. "If you're Chris Seelbach and you're saying things that appeal to a group of liberals in the community, they're happy when you speak out against (Donald) Trump," said Mack Mariani, chair of Xavier University's political science department. "They're thinking: 'This Seelbach guy is thinking exactly what I'm thinking.'" It's not just national issues that have sucked up council's time. They've spent plenty of time taking up political causes, such as promoting Genocide Awareness Month or opposing Islamophobia and anti-Semitism. Over their nearly four-year term, members created 68 resolutions recognizing citizen achievements – from marathon runners to Food Network cooking champions, often with speeches and lengthy presentations. "There's a value in recognizing our history and a value in celebrating the good feeling people have for the city and its people," said University of Cincinnati political science professor David Niven. "But it can only be a part of the job. … When it's a regular, reoccurring and often central accomplishment of the day, that's where it becomes a reason to be concerned." Councilman Chris Seelbach routinely honors city residents during LGBT Pride Month and Councilwoman Yvette Simpson does the same for Black History Month, as a way to recognize important achievements. Sittenfeld has had a busy and productive year on City Council – from new policy that forces banks to maintain foreclosed properties to launching a 'Golden Cincinnati' Initiative that created an aging and accessibility czar at City Hall. He also spearheaded an idea to use technology to solve the heroin crisis. The resolutions he's sponsored are just another way to respond to his constituents, he said. "I'm not sure I've ever done a resolution without someone in the community saying 'This is really important,'" Sittenfeld said. "It takes almost no time, and it's almost always in response to sincere citizens who care about issues and want their elected leadership to take a position."	1
Abstract Hemispherectomy has been performed in the treatment of epilepsy in association with hemiplegia for over 50 years. However, the optimal timing of surgery with respect to age at presentation and the influence of underlying pathology on outcome is only slowly emerging. This study reports on the clinical course and outcomes of 33 children who underwent hemispherectomy at Great Ormond Street Hospital, London, between 1991 and 1997. Age at surgery was 0.33–17 years (median 4.25) with 1–8 years follow‐up (median 3.4). The underlying pathology was developmental in 16 (10 hemimegalencephaly, two polymicrogyria, two focal cortical dysplasia, one diffuse cortical dysplasia and one microdysgenesis), acquired in 11 (six middle cerebral artery infarct, three post encephalitis/trauma, and one each of hemiconvulsion–hemiplegia epilepsy and perinatal ischaemic insult) and progressive in six children (four Rasmussen encephalitis, two Sturge–Weber syndrome). At follow‐up, 52% were seizure free, 9% experienced rare seizures, 30% showed >75% reduction in seizures and 9% showed <75% seizure reduction or no improvement. Seizure freedom was highest in those with acquired pathology (82%), followed by those with progressive pathology (50%) and those with developmental pathology (31%). However, seizure freedom, rare seizures or >75% reduction in seizures occurred in 100% of those with progressive pathology, 91% of those with acquired and 88% of those with developmental pathology, indicating a worthwhile seizure outcome in all groups. Hemiplegia remained unchanged following surgery in 22 out of 33 children, improved in five and was worse in six. No significant cognitive deterioration or loss of language occurred, and four children showed significant cognitive improvement. Behavioural improvement was reported in 92% of those who had behaviour problems pre‐operatively. Introduction Hemispherectomy was described independently in 1928 by Dandy and L'Hermitte (Rasmussen, 1983) as a radical treatment for malignant glioma of one hemisphere, but with a failure to offer improvements in survival or quality of life compared with more conservative treatments. Further interest in the procedure followed the publication in 1950 (Krynauw, 1950) of a study of a series of 12 children with infantile hemiplegia, seizures and behaviour disorders who underwent hemispherectomy for epilepsy with good seizure outcome. The popularity of anatomical hemispherectomy subsequently declined in the late 1960s because of the delayed complications of the procedure (Oppenheimer and Griffith, 1966; Till, 1967; Brett, 1969), which included obstructive hydrocephalus, superficial haemosiderosis and intracranial haematomata in as many as 33% patients (Rasmussen, 1983). However, a modification of the procedure (Adams, 1983) and the development of the sub‐total or functional hemispherectomy (Rasmussen, 1983; Tinuper et al., 1988) largely abolished these complications. Hemispherectomy can be considered for those with seizures arising from one hemisphere where there is a pre‐existing structural abnormality of that hemisphere. It is particularly suitable for those with a pre‐existing hemiplegia and/or visual field deficit, a group in whom co‐existing cognitive and behavioural impairments are common. However, it may be offered to those without such disabilities in circumstances such as Rasmussen syndrome, where inevitable deterioration in epilepsy is accompanied by deterioration of both motor and intellectual performance (Vining et al., 1997) and where lesser resections are unsuccessful (Platt et al., 1988). The effectiveness of hemispherectomy for epilepsy associated with congenital hemiplegia was initially evaluated by the degree of seizure relief it offered (the traditional outcome measure used in adult epilepsy surgery). Seizure outcome was impressive but positive effects on cognition and behaviour were increasingly reported and were replicated by other groups in the 269 published reports of the procedure by 1961 (Rasmussen, 1983). The cognitive and behavioural impairments associated with congenital hemiplegia may be profound, especially for those with very early onset epilepsy and dysplastic lesions in whom development appears to remain arrested until clinical and sub‐clinical seizure activity is abolished. Such secondary impairments, which constitute the severe epileptic encephalopathy suffered by these children, are emerging as the main target for epilepsy surgery in childhood. The aim is to offer surgery at a younger age in order to maximise the beneficial effects on developmental trajectory. This aim challenges our ability both to predict outcome and to justify major surgery in very young children. In the context of clinical decision‐making, it would be very difficult to randomize to early or late surgery. At this stage, therefore, we have to analyse our attempts to address these issues in the clinical setting and this is the main purpose of this study. We report the clinical outcomes of hemispherect	1

Joey Comeau, Lockpick Pornography (Loose Teeth Press, 2005)  Joey Comeau's name sat in the back of my head for years before I actually got round to reading his work. A number of friends revere his work, and a particular online literary review zine, which must remain nameless or the review gets redlined at Amazon, championed his stuff as long as I read them.

A number of friends revere his work, and a particular online literary review zine, which must remain nameless or the review gets redlined at Amazon, championed his stuff as long as I read them. And given a title like Lockpick Pornography, I figured, how can you go wrong? Now, the book and its sequel are slated to be published in an omnibus volume from ECW Press, so what better time to write this review? (I actually finished the blessed thing last summer while on a roadtrip to visit relatives.)  As you may be able to surmise from the opening paragraph, I wanted to like this book. I wanted a good deal to like this book. But somehow I never got round to it. I didn't dislike it, mind you, but it never reached out and grabbed me. Normally, I'd give the writer of such a thing the benefit of the doubt, but I'm not going to in this case; I'm pretty sure the problem doesn't lie with me here. Comeau has a lot of big ideas, and it's really quite commendable that he's going to attempt to tackle them. The problem is, he never actually does. I'm not sure whether he's just throwing stuff out there with the belief that "if you're reading this book, you probably feel the same way I do about these things, so I really don't need to go into any detail" (which, at best, would be hopelessly naïve), simply using this stuff as plot device (which, at best, would be exploitative), or throwing it in simply for shock value (in which case, this would be bizarro fiction, but not as accomplished as the better bizarro authors). I toyed around with possibility #3 for about a week after finishing the book before throwing it out; there's enough passion in the places where Comeau makes an attempt at addressing all this stuff—the raging anti-capitalism, the gender dysphoria (and inventive ways his characters have of dealing with that), the sometimes-irresistable urge to take your experimental novel and turn it into a genre noir thriller—that I'm pretty sure he's not just trolling. And #2 doesn't quite feel right, either, and for much the same reason; I'm not sure someone using gender dysphoria solely as a plot device would be able to handle it with Comeau's sardonic-but-not-cruel take.  Which leaves me with choice #1, but I kind of feel like a heel employing it, no matter how naïve the resulting novel turns out to be.  The unfortunate part about it is that author naïvete turns into character shallowness, as no one in the novel ever gives even the most passing thought to why they're all doing this. In his defense, I should say that it seems Comeau either attempts and fails, or had thought about attempting and then abandoned the idea, to rectify this in the book's climactic sequence; I was planning on going on with that statement, but then realized we'd be well into spoiler alert territory, so trust me on this one.  I haven't yet read any of Comeau's more recent, and much more popular novels (my local public library, which is notorious for carrying very little other than Stephen King and Danielle Steel, even has a copy of One Bloody Thing After Another!), so I can't just pop out some sort of wry comment about how Lockpick Pornography is a rough early example of the style of etc., and yet for some reason I want to; that's what it feels like, anyway. It's very much a style-over-substance book, and I'd imagine it will have a great deal of appeal to the twenty-first-century version of the disaffected youth who flocked to see movies like Been Down So Long It Feels Like Up to Me back in the seventies. Be aware, however, you will have to fill in a number of wide, unbridged gaps that it doesn't seem to me you should have to. ** ½	1
Meat and cheese lovers may have gotten excited recently when an article in the Washington Post was published with the headline "Atkins diet's return reflects idea that saturated fat shouldn't be demonized." No doubt the Washington Post got excited, too, because there's no better way to pick up flagging newspaper sales than to tell people that it's okay to eat the foods they love. Sorry, Washington Post, but it's NOT okay to eat foods high in saturated fat like red meat, cheese, butter, and full-fat ice cream. Is saturated fat bad for you and your heart? Yes. We know beyond any reasonable doubt that increased saturated fat intake raises LDL cholesterol levels; and over time, higher LDL levels promote more atheroclerosis and cardiovascular-related mortality. To bolster this ridiculous claim, the Post referred repeatedly to a study published in the March issue of the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition. The study analyzed several epidemiological studies (the studies' lengths ranged from 5 to 23 years) and found no significant evidence that dietary saturated fat is linked with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. But here's the problem: It has always been very difficult to find any significant correlation between saturated fat intake and cardiovascular disease using epidemiological data within a given population. The reason is not because a correlation does not exist but because of the way people's eating habits are measured. In these epidemiological studies, scientists used dietary recall data, "but dietary recall data are very inaccurate," points out Dr. Jay Kenney, Nutrition Research Specialist at the Pritikin Longevity Center. In numerous investigations on the efficacy of 24-hour dietary records, scientists have found that the majority of people cannot estimate their food intake, or forget what they have eaten, or outright lie (Who wants to admit they wolfed down two cheeseburgers for lunch?). And even when 24-hour food recalls are fairly accurate, they are still highly suspect as a measurement of people's overall food intake. First of all, people often eat very different amounts of saturated fat from day to day. The day they recorded their sat fat intake may have been the day they had bean chili for dinner. The next day (the day that was not recorded) may have ended with a sirloin steak and crème brulee. Secondly, people often change their diets over time, especially in industrialized countries like the U.S. Hence, what their daily diet was at the beginning of a 10-year study may have changed significantly two, three, or five years into the study. "The point is: When your measurements of dietary variables are very inaccurate – and when you have no scientific tool to measure subjects' eating habits over long periods of time – the odds of finding a significant correlation, even if one exists, go way down," states Dr. Kenney. Of course, if we study the actual cultures and eating habits of populations that we know eat far less saturated fat over their lifetimes, we see much lower levels of cholesterol in these populations, and much lower levels of cardiovascular events like heart attacks. Here are two examples: Okinawa Researchers traveled to Okinawa and for years tracked the daily eating habits of the people living on this island off the coast of Japan. It was easy to confirm that Okinawa's people ate very little saturated fat because there wasn't much of the fat on the island to begin with. The population followed a diet (as they had for centuries) that was high in unrefined carbohydrates like fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. They ate up to 20 servings of unrefined carbohydrates daily. Staples included sweet potatoes, dark green vegetables, green peppers, rice, fresh fruit, tofu (and other forms of soy), as well as seafood rich in omega-3 fatty acids. While fish made up about 11% of the diet, only about 3% came from saturated-fat-containing foods like poultry and meat. On this very low-in-saturated-fat diet, Okinawa's citizens were found to have 80% fewer heart attacks than Americans. They were also lean (Take that, Atkins diet proponents), averaging a body mass index of just 22. There's more good news: They had (and still have) the longest disability-free life expectancy in the world. They also have the highest percentage of citizens over the age of 100. Is there a correlation here between low-in-saturated-fat diets and very low rates of heart disease? You bet. The China Study Heralded as the most comprehensive study of diet and disease ever conducted, the China Study by Cornell University scientists looked at 16,700 individuals in the 65 provinces of China over a six-year period in the 1980s. It examined more than 1,000 separate diet, lifestyle, and environmental aspects relating to each of the subjects. The provinces with the least amount of cardiovascular disease were those following a very low-	1

TORONTO — Jared Odrick hails a city cab on Spadina Avenue, the busy main drag of Chinatown, where open sidewalk displays lure passersby to buy fresh produce or bedazzled slippers or bonsai plants. He hops into the car, and gives the driver directions. "You can make a right on Bloor," Odrick says, "and go up Bedford." Jared Odrick is entering his seventh NFL season and second with the Jags. Gary McCullough/AP Here in Canada's largest city, this American football player sounds like a local, because he is one. A few blocks back is the historic row house built circa 1883 that Odrick bought in mid-June, setting a new price ceiling for this neighborhood of Toronto. This is the first property Odrick has ever owned. Not in Miami, where he was a first-round draft pick by the Dolphins in 2010. Not in Jacksonville, where he signed a five-year, $42.5 million contract in 2015 free agency. The 28-year-old Pennsylvania native has found a home outside America and outside football. "Team sports take away individuality," Odrick muses as the cab rolls along. "That's my lead-up to why I'm here in Toronto. I'm doing my own thing, and people think it is so weird when I go back." It might sound ironic, but Odrick is breaking out of the football culture to maximize his career as a football player. For the next 12 hours on this day in June, he'll shuttle between four different appointments as part of a meticulous program to prime his 6-foot-5, 301-pound body for the 2016 season. He's the kind of guy who approaches life tactically, writing down bullet-point strategies for his goals in life. The time he spends in Toronto is central to his plan for How To Have A Successful NFL Career: Build your own team. Educate yourself. Have a life outside football. Find out more about yourself before you're done playing. He leans over and asks the cabbie to take a detour to one of his favorite breakfast spots on Dupont Street. "People get blinded by the religion of football," Odrick says. "Players, coaches, fans. But the best way to stay in the business is to keep your personal business running, and the best way to do that is to break some molds. Seek out knowledge on your own. Have individual thoughts. Be a little counter-culture." That's what he's doing in Canada. As an American citizen, Odrick can only spend up to 180 consecutive days across the border. This was one of those days, a window into the experience that has given Odrick a different frame of reference than many of his NFL peers heading into his seventh professional season. * * * Jenny Vrentas/The MMQB 10:59 a.m., Rose and Sons Odrick enters under a retro storefront that simply reads "FOOD," a sign repurposed from the diner that previously occupied this space, People's Foods. This is a tiny casual-chic spot, the walls stocked with old books and blackboards listing the daily menu. Odrick has befriended the owner, Anthony Rose, a Toronto chef who has a colony of restaurants all over the city. Rose helps run a summer lunch program offering healthy and locally sourced meals to area kids, and as Odrick puts down roots in Toronto, he's hoping to lend a hand. Settling into a wooden booth by the window, Odrick doesn't glance at the menu. He already knows what he wants: the All-Day Breakfast, with three eggs and bacon—he's skipping the pork chop today—and the grilled romaine Caesar. "You have to have fat in the morning," he says. "That helps your brain wake up and function." He follows wellness commandments like this all day. Odrick's breakfast arrives with a side of potato hash, but he pushes that plate away. He steers away from carbs, especially in the morning, instead choosing breakfast foods shown to boost stimulating neurotransmitters like dopamine. The results: His defensive lineman's frame has just 12 percent body fat. Odrick would like to correct the football culture, at least the parts of it reflected in a sign he remembers hanging in the Dolphins training room: "Be a player, not a patient," a quote from Jason Taylor. A few weeks ago, the Jaguars' Instagram account posted a Training Tip of the Week, sponsored by a cold-pressed juice brand: "Pre-exercise meals should be 200-300 calories and 75% carbohydrates and 25% protein." Even at the breakfast table, Odrick is doing his own thing. When he entered the NFL six years ago, he wasn't as discerning. He spent his offseasons the way	1
News Releases from Region 09 U.S. EPA recognizes food recovery efforts in California Winners from Daly City, North Hollywood and San Diego area receive awards Contact Information: Nahal Mogharabi (mogharabi.nahal@epa.gov) 213-244-1815 LOS ANGELES – The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is recognizing the outstanding accomplishments of seven California winners participating in EPA's Food Recovery Challenge. Winners include Sprouts Farmers Markets in Daly City and Carlsbad, Calif., Ramona High School in Ramona, Calif., Food Forward in North Hollywood, Calif., Cherokee Point Elementary School in San Diego, Calif., the City of San Diego and the San Diego International Airport. "Food Recovery Challenge award winners serve as role models in their communities and for other organizations," said EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt. "Their hard work and effective efforts to divert wasted food from landfills is paying off through social, financial and environmental benefits. I encourage other organizations to replicate the successful food recovery operations of our Challenge winners." EPA recognizes Food Recovery Challenge participants and endorsers with awards in two categories: data-driven and narrative. The data-driven award recipients achieved the highest percent increases in their sector comparing year-to-year data. Narrative award winners excelled in the areas of source reduction, leadership, innovation, education and outreach and endorsement. Nationally, 16 participants received awards. The seven winners in California were: Data-driven Improvement by Sector Winners: Sprouts Farmers Market Grocer: Carlsbad Store Newcomer: Daly City Store Sprouts acts on their commitment to Zero Food Waste through their Food Rescue and Food Waste to Farms programs, and through customer engagement, preventing more than 31 million pounds of wasted food from entering landfills and avoiding more than $1.5 million in landfill fees in 2016. Team members participate in training on the importance of food donations in the community, proper shrink management, and guidelines for donations. In 2016, Sprouts was able to provide more than 19 million pounds of nutritious foods to its communities, resulting in nearly 16 million meals. Through its various initiatives, Sprouts has developed successful business-to-business and non-profit relationships that illustrate the power of partnerships to reduce environmental impacts and eliminate hunger in communities. K-12 Schools: Ramona High School (Ramona) Ramona High School's Eco-Leaders, in collaboration with the County of San Diego and the Ramona Unified School District, run a district-wide, collaborative wasted-food reduction and composting program. Students weigh, measure, chart and keep accurate data from eight school sites. The data is sent electronically to the County each day. Nutrition staff reported revisions to their food preparation practices after seeing how much food was going to waste. Prepared food suitable for donation is placed in a walk-in freezer and collected weekly by a local pantry and distributed to the underserved in the community. Non-Profits: Food Forward (North Hollywood) Food Forward rescues fresh local produce that would otherwise go to waste. Produce is collected from over 750 private backyards, 22 weekly farmers' markets, and the downtown Los Angeles Wholesale Produce Market. In 2016, the Wholesale Recovery program rescued over 13.7 million pounds of fresh fruits and vegetables. This produce would have otherwise been sent to landfill. One hundred percent of the recovered food is donated, within hours, to hunger relief agencies across eight counties in Southern California. In 2016, Food Forward helped feed 1.25 million individuals facing food insecurity. Narrative Category Winners: Source Reduction: Cherokee Point Elementary School (San Diego) Cherokee Point Elementary School is a leader when it comes to reducing and diverting wasted food. With an enrollment of approximately 400 students, all receiving free and reduced price meals, Cherokee Point is committed to reducing wasted food at the source. The school accurately forecasted the amount of food needed for student meals by using the "offer versus serve" model which allows students to decline some of the items offered that they don't intend to consume, recovered certain foods and beverages to use in another meal service, and reduced salad bar pan size. Additionally, students separate their food scraps at lunch so they can be sent off-site for composting. Leadership: City of San Diego (San Diego) The City of San Diego's Environmental Services Department's Commercial Food Waste Diversion Program has a comprehensive food recovery education program for commercial food providers. The program had over 80 participants in 2016, composting nearly 8,000 tons of wasted food. Participants included the largest generators of food waste in the city, and all its larger venues, such as the Convention Center, Zoo, Safari Park and SeaWorld San Diego, took part. During 2016, 17 of the larger generators alone increased their food donation by over 3,000 pounds per week.	1
Dear Ms. Kaminer, I read your article, What to Make of the Rape Accusations at Amherst College, today, and I feel it necessary to express how disappointed I am. If there's a subcategory in rape culture that angers me most, it's victim blaming. The harm that comes from blaming a survivor of sexual assault is so substantial, that it often is as traumatic as the assault itself. The blatant mocking of Epifano that occurs throughout your article is simply unacceptable: "Put aside questions about the accuracy of Epifano's recollections and the soundness or gross insensitivity of the counselor's advice. Never mind the absence of discussion about reporting the alleged attack to law enforcement; rape is, after all, a felony, which courts are better equipped to address than colleges. Focus instead on Epifano's reaction to the prospect of a disciplinary hearing: Hours locked in a room with him and being called a liar about being raped? No, thank you. I could barely handle seeing him from the opposite end of campus; I knew I couldn't handle that level of negativity." You see, Ms. Kaminer, Epifano denied even the thought of going through a trial in order to protect herself. Maybe that seems ridiculous to you, but sometimes after going through a terrible trauma, one cannot possibly bear the thought of recounting that trauma over and over. Also, Epifano may or may not have known this, but out of every 100 rapes, 46 get reported to the police, 12 lead to an arrest, 9 are prosecuted, 5 lead to a felony conviction, and 3 rapists will spend a single day in prison*. The long and frustrating battle to hope that your rapist is not one of the 97% who walk takes a toll on survivors that Epifano didn't want to subject herself to. And that's okay. What you need to realize is that it's okay for Epifano to put herself first. If she didn't feel like she could handle an entire trial, then let's applaud her honesty and willingness to listen to her own needs, instead of criticizing her because you or someone else would've "done differently." In reality no one knows, not even another survivor, of what she's endured. You then go on to question the trauma she felt from her rape: "Is rape necessarily this traumatic? Are all rapes equal in the damage they inflict? Yes, according to some popular feminist wisdom. No, according to the diverse experiences of rape victims I've known — including women who've been raped while hitchhiking and by strangers who broke in to their apartments, as well as women raped by dates or acquaintances… I'm not criticizing or judging Epifano for being acutely frightened and depressed. I'm not presuming to tell women how they should or shouldn't react to being raped. Quite the opposite. I'm simply suggesting that different women react differently, according to their different circumstances, strengths and vulnerabilities. I'm not denying the horrors of rape and the outrage, shame, or fear it can engender, but I am questioning the assumption that it naturally and inevitably breaks women down. I'm wondering if that assumption isn't sometimes self-fulfilling." First, I'd be willing to bet that the source you have for that "popular feminist wisdom" is incorrect. The feminist approach to rape crisis intervention is letting the survivor know their options and empowering them to make those decisions themselves, in order to put control back in their lives. Secondly, every person reacts entirely differently from any other person who's been raped. You say you understand this, just to go ahead and question the assumption that rape "naturally and inevitably breaks women down." For some, yes, it breaks them down. For others, they can go on with their daily lives as if a rape never happened. One can never assume any reaction from any survivor. Epifano, no matter her decisions or reactions from her rape, did what she could in order to survive. Maybe you don't agree with how she went about it, but she knows herself better than you do, so stop judging her. She is strong and brave and an inspiration. Angie Epifano is a survivor.

According to the RID Annual Reports, the pass rate of the NIC is quickly dropping, from 77% in 2010 to a shocking 26% in 2014. With the current iteration of the NIC, the pass rate has dropped to nearly half that of the first year it was available (51% in 2011). This decline suggests that the current exam is invalid, and many are concerned that the testing format of 4-minute vignettes does not sufficiently mimic real-life interpreting scenarios. Dr. Dennis Cokely sent a letter to the RID board in 2012 raising valid questions about the enhanced NIC exam. To quote Dr. Cokely: "A clear, empirically supported explanation of why the current NIC assessment is valid and can be reliably assessed by raters must be provided to the membership." (Click here to read his letter that explains his - and our - concerns in detail.) More and more states are turning to licensing as a way to protect clients from unqualified signers, and often the requirement for licensure is RID certification. Therefore, it is imperative that we have a reliable and valid exam in place. We recognize that RID is in the process of assembling a certification task force, but we feel the following points need to be addressed with urgency: Determine NIC exam validity and establish full transparency about the testing process If the test is deemed invalid, develop a new test Publish the NIC rubric so candidates may properly prepare before testing Provide more in-depth, personalized feedback on test results Offer certification process extensions to candidates until a valid test is in place These actions will help ensure competent interpreters aren't forced out of the profession due to an invalid certification process. Our goal is to get as many signatures as possible before August 7th, so that the petition can be seen at the RID National Conference. If you choose to sign this petition, we encourage you to use the "I'm signing because…" box to explain to the RID board why this is important to you, as well as indicate if you are an RID member.	1
Goldstone says: "To echo Nigel's concerns, we have seen kind of a corporatization of what's going on on State Street, and unfortunately, the sad part of it is, the Orpheum has now been a part of that. I mean, a lot of people don't know this, but earlier this summer the Orpheum Theatre signed an exclusive booking arrangement with Live Nation Entertainment. For people who don't know who Live Nation is, it's a publicly traded mega-corporation based out of Beverly Hills, California, who doesn't have a single full-time employee in the state of Wisconsin. In the industry they're referred to as the Wal-Mart of promoters because they've basically built a business going into cities and either acquiring and downsizing local independent promoters like Frank Productions or simply running them out of business. And it's sad to see the Orpheum allow them into our market to attempt that as well." He then goes on to tout the still-unnamed new Frank venue as being locally owned and operated. It's a little surprising that he's so openly critical of Live Nation, because Frank has co-presented shows with Live Nation, and there are still Frank Productions shows for which you can buy tickets through Ticketmaster, which is part of Live Nation. Orpheum general manager Perry Blanchard, who was also a guest on the segment, counters: "First of all, the ownership of the theater is still local. We have a booking arrangement, and the person that books our room books the House of Blues in Chicago, and Billboard's just put out a list yesterday of the top 25 clubs in America, and the House of Blues Chicago was number 5. And when we were looking for people to book our room, we had many conversations with a lot of promoters, and Live Nation came to us and they were the most realistic about what they expected from our venue. And the reason we went with Live Nation was because we want the ownership of this theater to stay local, and we need events in our room to keep it thriving, and they're driving so much business into our room right now that we couldn't be happier with their involvement. And ultimately, with what the Franks had coming down the pipe, we needed to have the best company to help us compete with what was coming down the line." Blanchard later adds: "You can say what you want about Live Nation but they're the best at what they do, and we're certainly happy to have them on board with us." Anyhow, not entirely surprising to hear a business criticize a competitor, but it's a bit more heated than I would have expected. The segment overall is worth a listen—good on O'Shea for asking some hard questions and stirring up the conversation.	1
Whether they are senior citizens, middle-aged fathers or barely able to drink legally, all men are inherently attracted to young women who are in their early 20s. In his book Dataclysm: Love, Sex, Race, and Identity - What Our Online Lives Tell Us About Our Offline Selves, author and OKCupid co-founder Christian Rudder used the data preferences found on his dating site to determine that men find women between the ages of 20 and 24 most attractive - no matter how old they get. After [a man] hits thirty, the latter half of [OKCupid's] age range (that is, women over 35) might as well not exist,' Christian explained in an excerpt of his book, which was shared on Jezebel. Scroll down for video Pretty young things: OKCupid co-founder Christian Rudder used the data from his site to determine that men think women look best when they are between the ages of 20 and 24 'Younger is better, and youngest is best of all, and if "over the hill" means the beginning of a person's decline, a straight woman is over the hill as soon as she's old enough to drink,' he noted. A majority of the groups of men between the ages of 20 and 50 prefer women to be 20, while 21 was the next highest reported age. And only one age group, 45, chose 24, the highest age reported, as the one that looks best to them. Meanwhile, Christian found that women want a 'guy to be roughly as old as she is'. Younger is better, and youngest is best of all 'This isn't survey data, this is data built from tens of millions of preferences expressed in the act of finding a date,' he said. According to his research, women like men to be slightly older than them until they hit their 30s. Then they become interested in men who are their own age or slightly younger. By their 40s, women are most attracted to men who are two to eight years younger than they are. 'If we want to pick the point where a man's sexual appeal has reached its limit, it's there: 40,' Christian noted. But an eight year age difference is nothing compared to the 28-year age gap between 50-year-old men who think 22-year-old women are ideal. 'Another way to put this focus on youth is that males' expectations never grow up,' Christian wrote. 'A 50-year-old man's idea of what's hot is roughly the same as a college kid's.' However, there is no need to despair. Men may be most attracted to women in their early 20s, but many males end up with women who are in their age range or even older.	1
In a warming world, we expect to see increases in some extreme weather events. The science is pretty clear that in some parts of the world, drought and heat waves have and will continue to increase. In other areas, more severe storms along with precipitation and flooding have increased. Drought, heat waves, and floods are examples of changes to weather and climate patterns that will have costs for human society.  It's tricky to discern not only whether past extreme weather have changed, but also whether human-caused global warming is a factor. Scientists need high-quality records that go back many decades to see if there is any trend towards increasing or decreasing extreme weather. But weather is quite variable. We can see a rise or fall in extreme weather events with no apparent cause, human or natural.  While these trends tend to be shorter (over days, weeks, or perhaps months), some trends can have longer durations. How can we identify trends prior to high-quality instrumentation and how can we discern whether the extreme weather we see now is within natural variability? Those are the questions addressed in a new publication in the Journal of Geophysical Research by lead author Dr. Benjamin Cook and his colleagues. The title of the article, "Spatiotemporal drought variability in the Mediterranean over the last 900 years" clearly indicates that this study considers almost a millennium of drought records and focuses attention on the Mediterranean region. The authors use a powerful database called the Old World Drought Atlas to look back in time prior to modern instruments. This atlas is a collection of tree-ring data that measures drought using the Palmer Drought Severity Index. Within the Mediterranean region, there are 106 different tree-ring datasets. These datasets go back various lengths of time but since 1100 CE, the region is accurately sampled.  The Palmer Drought Severity Index accounts for changes in precipitation as well as changes in evaporation and storage of water within soils. By using this measurement, the authors are able to find multiple droughts throughout the Mediterranean region. Often times, the droughts occur simultaneously in different parts of the region. For instance, droughts are likely to occur at the same in in both the Western Mediterranean (Spain, Portugal, Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia) and in the east (e.g. Greece and Turkey). What did the authors find regarding the recent droughts in the Mediterranean? Well in recent decades, there has been a persistent and long-duration drought in the regions of Greece and the Levant region. The authors found that although the Greek droughts have been severe, they do not deviate from droughts that have been observed in the past. In the Levant region, the recent drought (1998–2012) exceeds what they have seen in the past 900 years. In fact, the recent drought is likely the driest period in the last 900 years and very likely the driest period in the last 500 years. Here is what Dr. Cook told me: To really understand the extent to which climate change is affecting extreme events, like droughts, you need to understand the full range of natural variability. This is why paleoclimate is so important - it gives us a way to extend our understanding way past the relatively short instrumental record of the last 100 to 150 years. In this study, we found that the recent drought in the Levant region of the eastern Mediterranean is likely worse than any comparable period of the last 900 years. This provides some independent support for other studies that have argued that climate change is intensifying drying in the region. To be clear, this study doesn't prove that droughts are getting worse, and it doesn't prove that human emissions of greenhouse gases are making droughts more severe. In fact, proving such statements would be nearly impossible. What this study does is put recent extreme weather into historical context. We know human carbon emissions will warm the world. We know that a warmer world affects precipitation and evaporation and this should affect droughts. We are observing that recent droughts are likely to worst on record. We also know that droughts and other extreme weather events have tremendous societal and economic consequences. Was the recent extreme Mediterranean drought caused by us? Probably. Or, if not caused by us, certainly made worse. Can we prove it? Probably not. However, it is clear to people like myself that study this topic that we have enough information to make decisions about the future planet we want to live in. It is clear that if we want to avoid further increases in extreme weather, we need to reduce our emissions of global-warming gases.	1
At long last, the numbers have been revealed about the sale of President Trump's boyhood home, located in a pleasant neighborhood of Queens, New York. The attractive Tudor home was sold five days ago to an unnamed buyer for $2.14 million — a tidy 54 percent profit for Michael Davis, the local real estate investor who purchased the property for $1.39 million through public auction only three months ago. He was praised by the press for "flipping" the property, built in 1940 by Mr. Trump's father Fred C. Trump, himself a real estate developer. There is reason to fuss over the five-bedroom home. It could very well be declared a historic property, or become a lucrative tourist destination. There is always intrigue, though. Both the New York Times and New York Daily News note that the lawyer who represented the buyer "is known to represent Chinese investors." If that proves to be true, there will be a media frenzy over a "Chinese connection," or words to that effect — so stand by. Meanwhile, the property remains a cozy house, and Mr. Trump has publicly revealed that he still loves it. "This property is so much more than just real estate; it's the childhood home of the 45th president of the United States, and it's a part of history. That intangible value makes it a perfect example of why special properties are appropriately sold by auction, just like art is. As they say, beauty is truly in the eyes of the beholder," notes Misha Haghani, founder of Paramount Realty USA, which managed the transaction. Find the home here. THE TRUMP TOUCH "Donald Trump gets it. He really gets it," says an appreciative Joseph Bast, president of The Heartland Institute, a Chicago-based nonprofit that favors free-market solutions to social and economic challenges. "At the signing ceremony for his 'Energy Independence Executive Order' Wednesday, President Trump stood surrounded by coal miners, talked to them like the real people they are, and thanked them for what they do," Mr. Bast continues, citing Mr. Trump's vow to put the miners back on the job. "President Trump stressed that this isn't about lowering standards for protecting health and safety, whether for miners or the public, but about ending unnecessary and costly regulations that kill jobs without producing any benefits. For many of us who were marginalized, ignored, or demonized for the past eight years, this is an occasion for real joy, celebration, and yes, vindication. We have a president who gets it — he really gets it," Mr. Bast concludes. SPICER-ISM The daily White House press briefing is an interesting showcase. On Tuesday, Press Secretary Sean Spicer was asked about ongoing but unproven challenges to the Trump administration — "you've got Russia, you've got wiretapping, there are investigations on Capitol Hill," one reporter noted. "If the president puts Russian salad dressing on his salad tonight, somehow that's a Russian connection," Mr. Spicer responded, adding, "I appreciate your agenda here." THE SESSIONS ERA BEGINS "The number of federal criminal prosecutions has declined for five consecutive years and is now at its lowest level in nearly two decades," writes John Gramlich, an analyst for the Pew Research Center who combed through new data from the federal courts. "The decline comes as Attorney General Jeff Sessions has indicated that the Justice Department will reverse the trend and ramp up criminal prosecutions in the years ahead." In fiscal year 2016, federal prosecutors filed criminal charges against 77,152 defendants, a decline of 25 percent since 2011, when 102,617 defendants were charged, and the lowest yearly total in two decades. The data here count all defendants charged in U.S. district courts with felonies and serious misdemeanors, as well as some defendants charged with petty offenses. They exclude defendants whose cases were handled by magistrate judges. "Prosecutions for drug, immigration and property offenses — the three most common categories of crime charged by the federal government — all have declined over the past five years," Mr. Gramlich says. "The Justice Department filed drug charges against 24,638 defendants in 2016, down 23 percent from 2011. It filed immigration charges against 20,762 defendants, down 26 percent. And it charged 10,712 people with property offenses such as fraud and embezzlement, a 39 percent decline." The analysts cite several factors for the trend, including then-Attorney General Eric Holder's direction in 2013 to federal prosecutors to ensure their cases "serve a substantial federal interest." Mr. Sessions, meanwhile, has pushed to increase prosecutions for drug- and gun-related offenses to reduce violent crime, which has risen nationally since 2015 according to the FBI — though such crime is "far below the levels recorded in the 1990s," Mr. Gramlich says.

The Rev. John B. Clark, at that time pastor of the Second United Presbyterian Church, in Allegheny, and a clergyman of nearly eleven years' standing, at the close of his services on Sabbath, the 5th.of August, requested those of his congregation who were willing to enlist in the national armies, to meet him in the basement of the church on the following Monday evening. Many came, and in three days' time three companies were organized, of one of which, Mr. Clark was elected Captain. Drill was immediately,commenced at the Allegheny Commons, and in a little time ten full companies had been recruited, and a regimental organization effected with the following field officers: John B. Clark, Colonel Frederick Gast, Lieutenant Colonel Hugh Danver, Major On the 29th of August the regiment, a thousand strong, proceeded to Harrisburg, arriving at Camp Curtin on the morning of the 21st, where it was armed and equipped, and on the evening of the same day started for Washington. Upon its arrival it crossed the Potomac, and went into camp at Camp Stanton. Drill was at once resumed, schools for the instrnction of ofhicers were established, and the command soon became proficient in duty, eliciting on parade the compliments of its superior officers by its fine soldierly bearing. It was assigned to the Second Brigade,1 Third Division, Fifth Corps. On the 29th of August, at the opening of the Second Bull Run battle, the regiment was moved out in the direction of Bailey's Cross Roads, and formed in picket line, with orders to suffer no person to pass through in either direction. For a day and a half this order was rigidly executed. But as the battle raged and increased in violence on the plains of Manassas, the Union army was borne back, and the broken and dispirited troops came pouring in, until they could be no longer held, the confused mass breaking through and moving on towards Washington, whither the division was soon afterwards ordered to follow. At the Capital, the regiment exchanged its arms, Austrian muskets, with which it had at first been supplied, for Springfield rifles. On the morning of the 14th of September, the command started on the march through Maryland, and arrived near Frederick at night-fall of the 16th. Here the division remained during the 17th, under orders to cover Frederick from the direction of Harper's Ferry. At sunset it received orders to move to Antietam, and at the moment of receiving the orders the sound of battle was heard for the first time that day. The command was again put upon the march, and for the entire night, up and down the rugged way it was urged forward and at a little after sunrise on the following morning, was halted on the Antietam battle-field, a short distance from Sharpsburg. A renewal of the battle was momentarily expected, and the men, though worn out by forced marches, stood ready for the onset. The ground was strewn with the unburied dead. Hour after hour it waited, but no sound of battle came. Finally, it having been ascertained that the enemy had withdrawn the brigade was ordered to Shepherdstown Ford, where it was saluted by a few shots from the enemy's artillery, from the opposite shore, but suffered no, loss. At night it retired a mile back from the river, where it went into bivouac, and while it remained in Maryland, was studiously drilled and disciplined. With the army it crossed the Potomac, and marched up, the Loudon Valley to Warrenton, where M'Clellan was relieved and Burnside put in command. From Warrenton the regiment marched to a point on Potomac Creek, four miles from Fredericksburg, where it went into camp and was engaged in drill and picket duty until the 12th of December, when it marched to the music of cannon towards Fredericksburg. On the following day the battle opened, and at three P. M., after the corps of Hancock and French had been checked and terribly slaughtered, Humphreys' Division was ordered in. It was a forlorn hope, but gallantly it went forward, and charged again and again those impregnable heights. What brave men dare do, they did; but it was all in vain. No human power could stand against the storm that swept that fatal ground. The One Hundred and Twenty-third occupied a position in the line, with its right reaching nearly to the pike, and bore manfully its part in the battle, suffering grievously. Lieutenant James R. Coulter was among the killed, and Captain Daniel Boisol and Lieutenant George Dilworth among the mortally wounded. The entire loss was twenty-one killed, and one hundred and thirty-one wounded. All night long it lay in position, and through the weary	1
France suspected the US of hacking into the president's communications network during the 2012 presidential election but American officials hinted that Israel may have been behind the cyberattack, according to the latest revelation on the National Security Agency (NSA) published in Le Monde newspaper. Top French intelligence officials Bernard Barbier and Patrick Pailloux travelled to Washington to demand an explanation for for an attempt to compromise the Elysée presidential palace's communications system, according to a briefing note prepared in April and published by Le Monde. At the time outgoing president Nicolas Sarkozy's teams were still working at the Elysée as he fought an unsuccessful battle to remain in power. The Americans, who were so anxious not to upset the French that the note spelt out how to pronounce their names, denied being behind the hacking and said that most of their closest allies - Australia, Britain, Canada and New Zealand - also denied involvement. But the branch of the NSA which handles cyberattacks, Tailored Access Operations (TAO) refused to vouch for Israel. "TAO intentionally did not ask either Mossad or [Israel's cyberintelligence unit] ISNU whether they were involved as France is not an approved target for joint discussions," the note said - a statement that the Le Monde article, coauthored by former Guardian journalist Glenn Greenwald, interprets as a hint that the Israelis were responsible. The attacks have been previously reported by French media, who said they were an attempt to insert monitoring devices into the system, but it is unclear whether the presidential networks were compromised for any time. Both US and French intelligence work closely with Mossad but not without a certain amount of mistrust. A 2008 NSA note leaked by the Guardian judged the Israelis "excellent partners in terms of sharing information " but added that Mossad is "the third most aggressive intelligence service in the world against the United States". France is also reported to have protested about Mossad's use of its soil to plan operations such as 2010 assassination in Dubai of Mahmoud Al-Mabhouh of the Palestinian movement Hamas. "Israel is a country which is a friend, ally and partner of France and does not carry out any hostile activity which could pose a threat to its security," the office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told Le Monde.	1

- A West Virginia police officer was charged with bribery for allegedly having sex with a woman who tried to get out of a speeding ticket. Marcus David Slauer of Fairmont reportedly was arrested Friday by state troopers and charged with one felony count of bribery. His bond was set at $5,000. AP reports, citing a criminal complaint, that Slauer pulled over a woman April 22, who told him she faced prison time if she violated any laws. Slauer asked the woman "to give him a good reason not to write her a bunch of tickets," the complaint said. The woman offered Slauer several items and then showed him her breasts. The two then drove to the Farmington Police Department, where they engaged in sex. Continue reading this story at FOXNews.com	1
A controversial Netflix series is prompting schools to warn parents about the risks of teen suicide. "13 Reasons Why" tells the fictional story of 17-year-old Hannah Baker, a troubled high school student who takes her own life. She leaves behind a series of audio tapes describing the "13 reasons why" she did it. The themes are graphic and intense, tackling not only suicide, but also sexual assault and underage drinking. Netflix Netflix says it's intended for mature audiences because of explicit and disturbing content, and it aims to provide an opening to difficult conversations. But educators and parents are concerned that "13 Reasons Why" might be glamorizing teen suicide, reports CBS News' Tony Dokoupil. The program's portrayal of Hannah's story has prompted school districts across the country to send warning letters to parents, saying "the show may be perceived as glorifying and romanticizing suicide." "Suicide is a tough issue to talk about," said Dr. Christina Conolly. She works for Maryland's Montgomery County School District, where she helped write a letter which states "adolescents watching without an adult ... could be at increased risk of self-harm." "Watching a suicide or knowing someone who has died by suicide can lead others to completing a suicide themselves," Dr. Conolly explained. Netflix responded to the concerns in a statement, saying "we gave the series a TV-MA rating, [and] added explicit warnings on the three most graphic episodes … we hope that "13 Reasons Why" can serve as a catalyst for conversation." Radio host Toby Knapp received a warning letter from his 13-year-old daughter Kyla's school, but only after she had already watched the series alone. "It's caused her mom and I to say, 'OK, what is our daughter watching, what is she spending her screen time on?'" "I think it's all too real for most of the people my age to cope with and understand," Kyla said. Mark Ralston / AFP/Getty Images The series is designed to have an intense impact on viewers, according to executive producer Selena Gomez, who has struggled with depression herself. "They have to see something that's going to shake them. This show is as real as it can possibly get," Gomez said about the series.  In other words, it's meant to be a realistic show, which leads to real family dialogue. "I'm glad we're having a lot of tough conversations, but I wish I had been tuned into those conversations sooner," Knapp said. Those conversations are extremely important to have — regardless of how they get started. According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, suicide is the second-leading cause of death among American teens between the ages of 15 to 19.	1
Most Americans who've followed the investigation into Hillary Clinton and her private email server fall into one of two camps. The first — those who believe the system is rigged and that she engaged in criminal acts but got away with them simply because her last name is Clinton. And the second — those who feel Hillary was the victim of yet another partisan witch-hunt that ended up being much ado about nothing, and that she's being harassed simply because she's a woman intent on breaking the highest "glass ceiling" of all. Undoubtedly congressional Republicans fall into the former group, so it was no surprise once the news broke that no criminal charges would be brought against Clinton that their first act would be to haul FBI Director James Comey in front of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee to ask him for an explanation. Comey essentially argued that the applicable law — a 1917 statute based on "gross negligence" in mishandling classified information — wasn't actually applicable. "No reasonable prosecutor would bring the second case in 100 years focused on gross negligence," testified Comey, a former U.S. attorney. "That's just the way it is. I know the Department of Justice, [so] I know no reasonable prosecutor would bring this case." The case against Clinton, Comey added, did not meet the "mens rea" legal standard of criminal intent. Yet one has to ask: What, then, was Hillary's intent? Perhaps it wasn't necessarily criminal intent, but there certainly was a lot of shady dealing going on between the Clinton Foundation, foreign leaders and others in the private loop with Hillary at the center. Even aside from the likelihood of hackers accessing the classified information on her private server, the reality that the Clintons used the secretary of state's office to peddle influence and thereby enrich themselves is outrageous. The personal email setup likely helped her cover-up Benghazi, too. Instead, the whole affair is chalked up to "carelessness." As Comey pointed out: "I see evidence of great carelessness, but I do not see evidence that is sufficient to establish that Secretary Clinton or those with whom she was corresponding both talked about classified information on email and knew when they were doing it that it was against the law." While Comey claims no "reasonable" prosecutor would bring charges, it's also true that one can indict a ham sandwich. Indeed, frivolous and politically motivated charges have often come from an overzealous prosecutor and a stacked grand jury bent on political mischief. (Former federal prosecutor Andrew McCarthy picks apart this defense from Comey by comparing it to a similar type of case where criminal negligence is often determined.) Or, taken the other way, how many who are accused of similar acts will now be using the "Hillary defense" to imply that they were only careless and had no criminal intent? One certainly could have lumped David Petraeus into that group had he been investigated post-Hillary. It's more difficult to sit there with a straight face and assure Americans that the system isn't rigged, as Comey did, when two high-profile cases turn out so differently — to the benefit of the political party in power, no less. And when the top law-enforcement official in the country agrees to a secret meeting with the suspect's former-president husband, Comey's insistence that he "did not coordinate … with anyone" rings hollow. No one in "the White House, the Department of Justice, or anyone outside the FBI family had any idea what I was about to say," added Comey. "I say that under oath, I stand by that. There was no coordination." We call bovine excrement on that: After all, why would Barack Obama be campaigning with Hillary on the very day she was cleared if he didn't know the fix was in? (Does anyone think a sitting president would share a stage with a politician who'd just been indicted?) Comey didn't need to have a phone conversation with Attorney General Loretta Lynch or Obama or anyone else to know that Clinton was to be let off the hook. For one thing, Obama's been tipping the scales of justice since last spring, claiming during a "60 Minutes" interview that Clinton's malfeasance didn't pose "a national security problem." The FBI director is appointed by the president, and serves at the pleasure of the president. Comey knew the score. There may be a second chance to give Hillary her due, though. In his opening remarks for the House hearing, Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-UT), who chairs the Oversight Committee, asked Comey if the FBI investigation probed into Clinton's congressional testimony and whether she lied under oath. When it was learned Comey had not and was waiting on a referral from Congress to do so, Chaffetz assured Comey he will get one. While the case could be a slam dunk on the factual side, the problem may be in proving intent there as well. Republicans don't have a great record against Clinton perjury. It will also be perceived, thanks to the mainstream media	1
Armed Agorism: A three part series about obtaining and owning firearms through the Grey Market by guest contributor Atreidies. If you would like more background on Agorism, Black and Grey markets check this video .The following information is for educational purposes only. Please follow the advice in the article at your own risk. Buying firearms is a potentially risky endeavor. If you are reading this article at the original source, you probably already understand that there is a defacto registration system in place on the federal level. This is not supposed to be the case, but most people wouldn't doubt the inability of the federal government to let go of a voluntary data collection system that by law requires a purge after 24 hours, especially regarding something as potentially dangerous to their power structure as firearms in the hands of ordinary citizens. When buying from a federally licensed dealer (FFL), the purchaser fills out a form (4473) and the data collected on that form is either called in or entered electronically to check against a state or federal database, and the government decides if you can exercise your natural right to self-defense, or your enumerated and (supposedly) constitutionally protected right to keep and bear arms. The law requires that this data be purged every 24 hours, and the reality is that this is likely true. HOWEVER, it's highly likely that the names and unique identifying information provided (SS Number, DOB, etc.) are added to a list of gun owners. There are ways to avoid having more "hits" on that list, or if you've never bought a gun through a licensed dealer, to never make it on the list in the first place. The 4473's are kept on file for 25 years or longer with the FFL, even if they go out of business. If the ATF or any other agency does a trace on a gun, they will go to the manufacturer, which will eventually lead them to the FFL that did the original sale and has the 4473 on file. If it is your name on the form, it is your door they will be knocking on. This is why private transfers are a great Grey Market solution, because they are essentially a dead end for the investigator. Private transfers happen between two individuals, without the FFL process. The seller can be an FFL selling from his private collection. Some states require private transactions to go through an FFL, so purchases in these states should be avoided. There are several avenues to find a seller, which I will discuss later. More importantly, there are some things to avoid when buying from private individuals. First, don't use a social media account that is traceable to your real identity. Second, don't provide your state of residence if you are buying out of state. Third, don't mention that you are ineligible to possess a firearm if you are ineligible. It is a federal crime for an individual to KNOWINGLY sell to someone who resides out of state, or is ineligible. If you don't tell them, they won't know, and you aren't causing them to run afoul of the law without their consent. Most won't ask, and if they do, just drop all contact and move on. Giving false information can trap you in a setup. As a seller, if a buyer ever tells you they are from out of state or that they are ineligible, DO NOT SELL THEM THE FIREARM. This is potentially a setup, so just halt the transaction and walk. Maybe they're just ignorant of the law, but you don't want to take the chance.	1
A showdown between hunters and Canadian indigenous tribes in British Columbia (BC) is looming ahead of the upcoming grizzly bear hunting season. The tribes have announced they will be enforcing their own introduced ban on grizzly hunting on their territories along the BC north and central coasts, but hunters and hunting organizations say the ban is not legal and they will continue their grizzly hunts. In 2012, The Coastal First Nations, a coalition of First Nations communities in British Columbia, proclaimed a grizzly bear hunt ban on their territory, regardless of the fact that it's sanctioned by the British Columbian provincial government, which continues to distribute trophy-hunting permits. The resource director at the Guardian Watchmen and chief of the Kitasoo/Xai'xais Nation, Doug Neasloss, said "Coastal Guardian Watchmen" will be patrolling their lands to enforce the ban by telling hunters to stop and by scaring their prey away. "We've been brought up to have respect for these animals and it's really unfortunate when people just come here and shoot these animals for sport. We like business to come to our territory, but there's some industries that are not accepted and not welcome, and trophy hunting is one of them." said Neasloss When grizzlies are trophy hunted, their heads are normally cut off, the body skinned and whatever of the carcass meat the hunters don't want is usually left behind. A BC provincial government spokesman said 300 grizzly bears in BC are killed each year in regulated hunts and that there are 15,000 grizzlies in the province - a figure disputed by conservation and animal rights groups. Canada's Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada says grizzlies are "a special concern" as they are "particularly sensitive to human activities or natural events". Alberta banned grizzly hunting in 2006, declaring the bear a threatened species. Although Neasloss said the First Nations' ban has reduced the number of grizzlies hunted each year and that many hunters have turned in their permits out of respect, experts say it is "unlikely the big business of bear hunting" will end anytime soon. One company, Covert Outfitting, offers grizzly hunting excursions for $19,000. According to a Covert Outfitting spokesman, the number of grizzlies they hunt stays within limits set by the Government to sustain the bear population. "Why do we personify an animal because it has a name and people take pictures of it?" said the spokesman "With grizzly bears, it's because they're beautiful and people think they're amazing, but if they were ugly and had no hair and killed people every day, everyone would want us to shoot them." He added "A lot of people think it's total insanity, but it's not. Maybe it's insanity living in the top of a skyscraper in downtown Vancouver, and having no idea what nature is or where our food comes from." However, Neasloss is confident they will win their fight for a ban on grizzly hunting, as he believes most British Columbians are against trophy hunting. "I'm very hopeful that we're going to stop it. And I think the province needs to listen to us, to start listening to the people," he said.	1

In the fall of 2008, Brooke and I, newly parents of our second daughter, floated a dream that one day we would take month-long vacations. First, we wanted to be able to really experience a location, have enough time to visit all the sites. Second, we had recently returned from a week-long Disney Cruise and I observed that around day 5 or so, you start to notice this enveloping feeling of euphoria, a deeper stage of vacation relaxation; where you are comfortable enough with your surroundings that your mind no longer has to focus as much effort on learning and adapting, but instead can focus solely on enjoyment and time spent together as a family. At this stage, your trappings at home, work related stress and other concerns have been muted. Maybe some of these feelings were purposefully implanted by Disney, but in any case, I felt that there is more to gain from longer vacations and tapping into this emotional stage. Third, we love to travel and being able to do it for month would be fantastic. Fourth, we know that children that travel more are smarter, more socially aware, accepting and more easily adaptable. Now, we were faced with four major hurdles in order to accomplish this. How do we afford such trips? How do we arrange for our kids to go on trips like this with us? How do I collect enough vacation time to take a month off? What do we do with our dog? One of the biggest hurdles was the cost, but with some planning and scrimping, we were getting close, but it was taking a long time. Just after our 10 year wedding anniversary, I decided to upgrade Brooke's rings and she helped pick out her dream set. After having it resized and then trying it on, however, she decided that she would rather spend that money on our California trip and create family memories than to have a material possession such as this when she liked her current rings well enough. We eventually worked out the other hurdles and in 2015 began making travel plans and reservations for our first month-long trip, a road trip in California! The dates of the trip shifted slightly throughout planning and the direction in which we were traveling (we changed from South to North to North to South), but the winter and spring of 2016 had us heavily into travel planning and other arrangements. Finally, on June 21, 2016, we arrived at the Tampa Airport (TPA) and flew out to San Francisco (SFO) by way of Saint Louis (STL) on Southwest Airlines. Our trip began and I began to document our experience for our future enjoyment. A big thank you is due to my cousin and best friend, Graham, who house and pet sitted while we were gone and this trip would not have been possible if he had not volunteered to do so. When we returned, family and friends also asked for details of our experience and I shifted that documentation online through simple pictures and eventually that evolved to this blog. Find the log of our fantastic trip below, listed by date and let me know what you think! I have starred the days that particularily stood out to us!

Of that, 34% was spent on groceries and 66% was spent on eating out. We weren't very strict with budgeting	1
MOBILE, Alabama - NAACP President and CEO Cornell William Brooks will join with local Alabama chapters of the NAACP for a statewide protest of the nomination of Senator Jefferson Beauregard Sessions III for U.S. Attorney General. Alabamians Against Sessions for Attorney General will include five protests at the five Alabama offices of Sessions, located in Mobile, Huntsville, Dothan, Birmingham, and Montgomery. "As a matter of conscience and conviction, we can neither be mute nor mumble our opposition to Senator Jefferson Beauregard Sessions becoming Attorney General of the United States. Senator Sessions has callously ignored the reality of voter suppression but zealously prosecuted innocent civil rights leaders on trumped-up charges of voter fraud. As an opponent of the vote, he can't be trusted to be the chief law enforcement officer for voting rights," said NAACP President and CEO Cornell William Brooks. President Brooks will be joined at a January 3 press conference and protest at Sessions' office in Mobile by Alabama State Conference President Benard Simelton and Mobile Branch President Lizetta McConnell. "Despite 30 years of our nation moving forward on inclusion and against hate, Jeff Sessions has failed to change his ways," said Alabama State Conference President Benard Simelton. "He's been a threat to desegregation and the Voting Rights Act and remains a threat to all of our civil rights, including the right to live without the fear of police brutality." The press conference featuring NAACP President Cornell William Brooks, Alabama State Conference President Benard Simelton and Mobile (AL) Branch President Lizetta McConnell, will take place in Mobile: on January 3, 2017 at 11 A.M. at the Office of Senator Jefferson Sessions, 41 West Interstate 65 Service North, Mobile, Al 36608 "Some of us in Alabama recall, Senator Sessions saying he liked the Klan," said Mobile Branch President Lizetta McConnell. "He said it was a joke, but saying something like that while discussing a case where the Klan murdered a young black man says a lot about a person. We need someone who realizes that attorney general has to actually care about the people's rights he's protecting and not just doing it because it's his job." Local members of the NAACP will hold multiple Press Conferences around the state on January 3 at four of Sessions' district offices: 200 Clinton Avenue West #802, Huntsville, Al 35801 Vance Federal Building, 1800 5th Avenue North, Birmingham, Al 35203 100 West Troy Street #302, Dothan, Al 36303 7550 Halcyon Summit Drive #150, Montgomery, Al 36117 ###	1
Turkey's Transport, Maritime and Communications Minister Ahmet Arslan has said that the long-anticipated Baku-Tbilisi-Kars railway project, which has prospects of to double Turkey's railroad transportation capacity, will be completed within two months. Talking to reporters regarding the Baku-Tbilisi-Kars railway project in Ankara on Saturday, Arslan said that despite the heavy winter conditions, they have continued to move forward with construction efforts and will finish the project within two months. The Baku-Tbilisi-Kars railway project will span a total of 838.6 kilometers, connecting the Turkish province of Kars with the Azeri capital, Baku and the Georgian capital, Tbilisi in Central Asia.  Arslan said the route will became an important part of the middle corridor in "China's One Belt, One Road project." He said the project was likely to double Turkey's capacity in railroad transportation. "It will take from 45 to 62 days to transport goods from China to Europe via the north corridor of the 'One Belt, One Road project.' However, this may be reduced to just 15 days when using the middle corridor," he said. The Transport Minister added, "All the other countries on this route, including Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan and Kazakhstan will continue to make investments in infrastructure accordingly." He added that Turkey's rail transportation capacity was expected to double when the middle corridor becomes fully operational.  "We are currently transporting 26.5 million tons of cargo on railways. Only Kazakhstan is planning to divert an additional 10 million tons of cargo to this route. Moreover, if we get only 10 percent of all Chinese transportation to Europe, we will get an additional 24 million tons," he said. This rail line is designed to become a key part of the southern route of the emerging New Silk Road network of trade and transport corridors that are being constructed to connect China and Europe.	1
Share. BioWare's new RPG is familiar, but different. BioWare's new RPG is familiar, but different. E3 2004 is a show of sequels. Half-Life 2, DOOM 3, Sims 2, Knights of the Old Republic II. Sure, they all look great, but we still like being a little surprised, and seeing something new at the big show. Thankfully, BioWare delivered today with an RPG that, although familiar, is something completely new at the same time. Although BioWare is probably best known for their Dungeons and Dragon's based Baldur's Gate series, Dragon Age isn't another foray into the D&D universe. As Joint-CEO Ray Muzyka told us, "Dragon Age is the spiritual successor to Baldur's Gate." However, Dragon Age has nothing to do directly with Baldur's Gate. Although set against a traditional fantasy backdrop, BioWare is hoping to do something a little different with Dragon Age, and the world won't be inhabited by Dwarves, Elves and Halflings -- although it will be filled with Dwarf-like, Elf-like and Halfling-like races. While this may sound like a cop-out, Ray explained that BioWare wanted to try something a little different, but still wanted it to be familiar to fantasy RPG players. Although nothing is finalized at this point, Dragon Age will feature archetypal races and classes (you know, fighters, clerics, mages and the like), and BioWare is looking to the community to decide exactly which classes and races they want to see in the game. We did see one completely new race that will be in the game, though. Although they don't have a name as of yet, or at least BioWare wasn't saying what the name was, the characters sport horns on their heads and look rather lizard (or perhaps dragon) like. BioWare is known for their intensive research when building universes, and as with all their RPGs, BioWare strives to create an extremely deep and rich lore to go with their worlds. Dragon Age will be no exception, and they have already developed a backstory and culture for the playable races as well as the non-playable races in the game. BioWare even has a few linguistics PhD students developing entirely new languages for Dragon Age. When asked about the significance of the title, BioWare told us that, like the Stone Age and Iron Age, they wanted to indicate that the game takes place in a time where dragons are prevalent. Like most RPGs, in the beginning you'll create a party of characters and tailor them to your desire. You'll also be able to hire henchmen during the game, and BioWare promises you'll run into some characters with a lot of personality, like Minsc from Baldur's Gate.	1
The experience in the tank, though, can be "brutal and unflinching in its portrayal of you and your reality," said Rogan. "That's a terrifying thing to a lot of people -- the fact that you're alone with your unconscious thoughts, with everything that's truly troubling you. It's the only time that you are untethered from your body." He's not alone in describing that untethered feeling as a potentially intense emotional experience. Your mind begins to run rampant. With nowhere else for thoughts to go, whatever problems, worries, or guilt sits in the back of your brain has to be confronted. As it's been put before, inside that tank, you have to face yourself. "It can be uncomfortable in the sense that you really can't run away from any of the things that are subconsciously troubling you, but I love that," Rogan said. "I'm not a big fan of running away from reality. I like handling all of the issues that bother me in order to go through life truly happy. There's a lot of people out there with ghosts, a lot of demons haunting their mind. In my opinion, this is your chance to face it head on and try to come up with a better path." But a fear of facing oneself shouldn't be a deterrent to any type of therapy. Sensory deprivation has become a popular exercise throughout the world, with validated positive results that extend into everyday life. Namely stress and anxiety reduction, but also as an adjunct for chronic physical pain. Dr. Darren Weissman, a holistic physician who has floated weekly since 1986, explains, "I really feel that it's a result of floating and getting myself out of the way that I saw how all these multiple disciplines that activate the healing potentials of the body actually work together." Floating isn't just about facing the negative aspects of life. It's also about being more aware of, and appreciating the good. Letting the little, good moments simmer -- instead of just moving to the next thing -- helps them feel (and actually become) more real. As Dr. Weissman says, it "allows us to recognize our body's potentials. It opens us to a whole different level of awareness and of who we are. We start to notice things. It awakens consciousness." Matt Frederickson, an avid user of floatation tanks, says, "Since I started doing it, I've become more calm, especially in my work life." A long-time sufferer of chronic neck, head, and back pain, Frederickson took his first float after hearing Joe Rogan's praise of the physical benefits of the isolation tank on Marc Maron's WTF podcast. "I thought it sounded interesting because I personally suffer from a lot of chronic pain, so that's what initially drew me to it." Frederickson tried therapies for his chronic pain, a lot of which worked a little, but he's found that no other practice produces results as consistently effective as the isolation tank. But, like Rogan, he gets more out of it than he initially sought. "I still use it mainly for the pain," he says. "It really helps lessen that, but I think the secondary benefit, for me, would be the anxiety that's tied to the pain."	1

No other weapon in the world can boast of possessing such a high spiritual quality as the Japanese sword. For over a thousand years the sword was revered as the very soul of the samurai warriors who wielded it, commanding awe, respect, and an almost religious devotion. The tumultuous events of modern Japanese history and the nation's relentless drive toward technological advancement, however, irrevocably sealed the sword's fate, and, along with the samurai class, the sword became an anachronism, both culturally and militarily.  As Japan entered a period of unprecedented Imperial expansion in the early twentieth century, the Japanese sword, despite its limited practical effect, became a feature of the soldier's arsenal-an echo of the mythical status it enjoyed in feudal times. The Yasukuni swords emerged during the build-up to World War II, in part to help meet the huge demands of the Imperial Army, but more importantly out of a desire to preserve time-honored forging methods, and to revive the spirit of the samurai. For these reasons, they were notably distinct from so-called "Showa-to," which were mass-produced and inferior in quality and artistry.  All swords were banned in the immediate aftermath of World War II, and the decades that followed have seen a decline in the popularity of Yasukuni swords, largely because of their associations with that war and the military. Another factor has been the stigma attached to Showa-to, which has helped to stereotype wartime swords in general.  Recent years, however, have seen a renewed interest in the surviving Yasukuni swords. Many collectors and appraisers have acknowledged the workmanship of these swords as displaying a perfect blend of technology and tradition, and a quality that can rival even that of the great classical smiths.  In his tribute to the Yasukuni smiths, acclaimed photographer and sword enthusiast Tom Kishida has compiled an extensive study of these rare and exceptional swords, drawing on a variety of sources to shed light on this often little-understood chapter of Japanese sword history. With his unique eye for capturing the beauty of the blades in his photographs, he has provided the reader with the most lavishly detailed book on Yasukuni swords to date. This will be an important addition to the libraries of specialists and connoisseurs, and to those who wish to deepen their understanding of these fascinating wartime weapons. Preview this book »	1

Curtis Granderson, bottom, and Justin Verlander were big-time contributors for the Tigers during Detroit's run to the 2006 World Series. (Photo: Otto Greule Jr, Getty Images) In a postseason that began with more than a dozen former Tigers in the mix for a World Series ring, three still are standing. And two just happen to be among the best Tigers' draft picks of not just recent history, but all-time. Justin Verlander, the new ace of the Astros, and Curtis Granderson, an outfielder for the Dodgers, each will play in their third World Series when things get started Tuesday night — and each will be searching for their first World Series ring. "No, no," Tigers general manager Al Avila said this week, when asked about his rooting interest — though it's worth noting, his father, Ralph, remains a consultant for the Dodgers, as does Tommy Lasorda, the godfather of Alex Avila. But his relationship with Verlander is deep, too. "What I usually like in these series is that it goes seven and it's really exciting." Houston also has another former Tigers celebrated draft pick, outfielder Cameron Maybin, who had two stints in Detroit. But few Tigers have been celebrated by fans over the past dozen years like Granderson, a third-round draft pick out of the University of Illinois-Chicago in 2002, and Verlander, the No. 2 overall pick out of Old Dominion University in 2004. More: Henning: Tigers seek bullpen relief down on the farm By 2006, both were full-time, big-time contributors in Detroit, Granderson as the starting center fielder and Verlander as the ace of the staff, as the Tigers stunned baseball and — three years after losing an American League-record 119 games — made it all the way to the World Series. That year not only marked the beginning of Tigers baseball renaissance, but also the start of two promising careers, one which should land Verlander, someday, in Baseball's Hall of Fame, and another which should at least get Granderson some consideration, depending on how much longer he plays. Verlander's 56.6 career WAR (Wins Above Replacement), per BaseballReference.com, is fourth-best ever among a player drafted and subsequently signed by the Tigers, while Granderson's 45.8 is fifth-best. They are easily the two biggest draft successes in the Dave Dombrowski/Al Avila tenure, which began in November 2001. Nobody else comes close. In the history of Tigers drafts — we're counting only June drafts here, not the now-defunct January draft — only Lou Whitaker (74.9, fifth round, 1975), Alan Trammell (70.4, second, 1976) and John Smoltz (69.5, 22nd, 1985) have gone one to accumulate higher career WARs than Verlander and Granderson. And Verlander, 34, is not anywhere close to being done adding to his career WAR, as he's shown in his nine-game run with the Astros. And Granderson, 36, probably isn't either, though he has struggled mightily in the couple of months since joining the Dodgers — so much so that he was left off the World Series roster, when the Dodgers announced their final 25 on Tuesday afternoon. More: Dodgers leave slumping Granderson off World Series roster Justin Verlander is 4-0 with a 1.46 ERA and 24 strikeouts in 24.2 innings this postseason with the Houston Astros. (Photo: David J. Phillip, Associated Press) NO. 1 WITH A BULLET The Tigers' first two first-round draft picks under the Dave Dombrowski-Avila era were total disasters. In 2002, Detroit selected a high-school shortstop from California named Scott Moore. In 2003, the Tigers took Wake Forest right-hander Kyle Sleeth. The two would combine to play 152 games in the major leagues, all by Moore, and none with the Tigers. When June 2004 rolled around, though, they were certain they had the man that could alter the franchise's fortunes. Other teams might have liked this guy or that guy. Verlander was no consensus. But the Tigers were all in on the lanky right-hander — and even better for them, they got word the Padres, with the No. 1 overall pick, planned to take a high-school infielder named Matt Bush with the No. 1 overall pick. "I can tell you one thing," said Avila, "Verlander was the guy we wanted." More: Avila defends analytics department: 'We went from nothing' Bush's story is well-documented. He struggled with injuries and substance and alcohol abuse, and several franchises later, he found himself in prison. He's turned his	1

A cock and a hen roosting together. Image: Wikimedia Commons. University of Adelaide research has shown that when students are taught to train chickens their attitude to chickens changes. Learning that chickens are smarter than most people think, and that they can be trained, promotes much more positive attitudes towards the birds. The research, published in the journal Animals, demonstrates a way of promoting more positive attitudes to animals. Through 'clicker training' chickens, students also learnt to train animals using 'force free' methods (encouragement rather than coercion) ─ important in future careers working closely with animals. The study, with first-year School of Animal and Veterinary Science students at the University's Roseworthy campus, investigated the attitudes of the students before and after they had practical classes clicker-training chickens. "We showed that attitudes to animals are linked to how clever we think that they are," says lead author Dr Susan Hazel, Senior Lecturer in Animal Behaviour in the School of Animal and Veterinary Sciences. "When students learnt to clicker train the chickens ─ who pick up colour discrimination incredibly quickly ─ they were more likely to think that chickens are intelligent than before the class. The students were also more likely to think chickens can experience boredom, frustration and happiness. "It was also a very effective class for teaching students the basics of animal training, and a number of students have told me afterwards how they have used that information in training their own animals." The students paired clickers with food, so the chickens learnt the click meant they have done what was wanted and would be rewarded. The students' first task was to get the chickens to peck on a red target. This behaviour was 'shaped', meaning initially the chicken was clicked and rewarded immediately with food when it looked at the target. Progressively rewards were only given when the chicken got closer, and closer, until it actually pecked the target. Chickens soon learnt colour discrimination. They learnt to peck on the red target, rather than green or yellow. "Animals learn all of the time, even when we are not deliberately training them," says Dr Hazel. "Understanding how they learn is integral to being able to manage or train animals effectively. "Chickens are descendants of wild jungle fowl, and to survive had to learn quickly what food was good to peck at and what they should ignore. The students not only learnt about how to train an animal, but they learnt chickens are much smarter they had realised, changing their views of chickens forever."

I got an awesome organic tea set, and some quirky kitchen accessories! The dog is an over mitt and the matroyshka dolls are measuring cups! I loved it, this is totally the kind of stuff I love. Thank you so much! :)	1
As it evolved, somatization became a way to think about and classify unexplained symptoms. The word somatization fell out of favor because it always implied psychogenicity. It was an hypothesis that was often inconsistent with observed data, and was mired in different schools of psychiatric thought and argument. For better or worse, it lacked face validity to many physicians. Still, it stayed around because it described common symptoms and situations that didn't fit in otherwise and which, at some level, made at least a little sense. In a previous post, John Quinter writes disparagingly of somatization: It 'in fact only reflects the medical observer's "psychologization" of the clinical problem.' John's comment exposes the opposition to somatization and a psychosocial basis for fibromyalgia. Dan Clauw, together with a group of truly expert co-authors, writes In the final analysis, physical versus psychologic distinctions regarding unexplained symptoms might rest on preconception and perspective rather than a priori hypothesis testing. Historically, observers of syndromes of unexplained symptoms have often drawn differing conclusions from like presentations. Whereas some observers have preferred to see a common physiological mechanism that explains symptoms, others have postulated common psychologic traumas ranging from childhood abuse to current stressors. Still others have invoked the tendency for some individuals to seek relief from social predicaments and for some clinicians and scientists to derive novel illnesses that accommodate them.1 Beginning at the end of the 20th, a clearer recognition of the limitations of the somatization concept was acknowledged. Sharpe wrote in 2006 'The assumptions that (a) bodily pathology can always explain bodily symptoms, (b) psychopathology can always explain bodily symptoms in the absence of bodily pathology, and (c) dichotomizing bodily symptoms into biomedical and psychiatric types is clinically useful were all found to have questionable validity and utility.2 He wrote further that 'Alternative multiaxial diagnostic approaches for the classification of bodily symptoms are proposed. These are intended to (a) give greater prominence to bodily symptoms in their own right, (b) allow etiology to be conceptualized in terms of multiple factors, and (c) provide the basis for integrating medical and psychiatric approaches to patient care. Such ideas are also found in the designation of illnesses like fibromyalgia and similar disorders as `somatic syndromes disorders,' 'physical symptom disorders,' 'functional symptoms disorders,' 'somatic and multisomatic symptom disorders.' It became clear that the line between psychiatric conditions and physical ones was difficult to draw, and as Sharpe said, etiology should be to be 'conceptualized in terms of multiple factors.' 'Somatization' was also confounded by the specialties that invoked it. The psychiatrists clearly had in mind a psychiatric disorder—the type of illness that I never saw in my patients with fibromyalgia. The primary care physician input, led by the careful, thoughtful and ultimately very helpful work of Kurt Kroenke and others in his group, noted that somatic symptoms were ubiquitous and mostly transitory. Rheumatologists saw a different pattern in chronic pain patients: persistent increased numbers of somatic symptoms and symptom severity. Kroenke developed as series of Patient Health Questionnaires (PHQ) that identified those with many somatic symptoms, and he couched descriptive language in non-psychiatric terms. In 1997 he wrote, 'For clinical or research use in primary care, the DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for somatization disorder are too restrictive, while the criteria for un- differentiated somatoform disorder are overly inclusive. In this article, we examine the validity of multisomatoform disorder, defined as 3 or more medically unexplained, currently bothersome physical symptoms plus a long (≥2 years) history of somatization.'3 In 2012, he developed an 8-item question that could be used together with the (disputed) DSM-5 Somatic Symptom Disorder. The items included GI-GU problems, back pain, joint and muscle pain, headaches, chest pain, dizziness, fatigue, trouble sleeping. It is a veritable checklist for fibromyalgia, but is neutral as to psychogenicity—as was the multisomatoform disorder. Without intending it, the 2010 ACR fibromyalgia made clear the prominence of somatic symptoms in fibromyalgia. Given multiple painful regions, the diagnosis of fibromyalgia is dependent on somatic symptoms. Maybe, as some have suggested, fibromyalgia should be considered as a kind of somatic pain disorder. Noll-Hussong in 2011 used the term, 'Pain-predominant multisomatoform disorder.'4 Not a bad phrase for fibromyalgia, to my mind. Collecting data on the number (or the number and severity) of somatic symptoms provides insights into fibromyalgia. Symptoms increase with age; people with fibromyalgia report many more symptoms than non-fib	1
I was in a public parking lot, trying to get my starving, exhausted, tantrum-throwing kids into the car when a little old lady tottered up to me and said, "Enjoy it while they're little! It goes by so fast!" I looked up at her as I was karate chopping my son's stiff-as-a-board body into his car seat and gave her a smile. A smile that said, "I want to strangle you." I wanted to strangle her because it's true. It does go by so fast. And I know I should be enjoying every minute of it. BUT I CAN'T! I can't because raising young kids isn't always enjoyable. Sometimes it is—there are precious moments of absolute parental bliss. Moments when my son places a chubby hand over my larger, dishwash-weary hand and asks me to play with him. Moments when my daughter blows me a kiss that I catch and tuck into my heart under my shirt. Moments when the three of us snuggle head-to-head-to-head reading a book. But a lot of the time having young kids sucks. It's relentless and boring and exhausting and infuriating. And the fact that I'm not loving every tantrum-filled, pooped-smeared, yogurt-coated, sleep-deprived moment makes me panic. Because it's going by so fast. The days of my children's childhoods are slipping through my hands faster than E. coli-infested sand and I know I'm not enjoying it enough, lady in the parking lot, so please don't remind me. When I creep into my kids' rooms at night and watch them sleep, my heart fills with love and peace … and regret. Regret that we didn't all enjoy the day that just ended more. I know one day the pain of it all will fade and I'll look back with a rosy tinge and think to myself, "I really enjoyed when my kids were little. It all went by so fast." But the one thing I promise to never do, is stop a young mom in a parking lot and tell her to enjoy it. Tell her it all goes so fast. Instead I'll tell her that I know raising young kids is hard. I'll tell her it's OK to cry. It's OK to scream. It's OK to fall to pieces at 5pm when the kids are pushing her every last button. I'll tell her to breathe. I'll tell her to hide in the bathroom if she needs to. I'll tell her to laugh at the insanity that is her life. And I'll tell her to kiss her baby's toes, not because they won't be little forever, but because it will bring her a moment of joy in her otherwise insane, chaotic day. Subscribe to my blog!

It's a delightful story I've heard dozens of times, and retold a few times myself: Abraham Lincoln faced with some thorny issue that could be settled by a twist of language, or a slight abuse of power, asks his questioner how many legs would a dog have, if we called the dog's tail, a leg. "Five," the questioner responds confident in his mathematical ability to do simple addition. "No," Lincoln says. "Calling a dog's tail a leg, doesn't make it a leg." But there is always the doubt: Is the story accurate? Is this just another of the dozens of quotes that are misattributed to Lincoln in order to lend credence to them? I have a source for the quote: Reminiscences of Abraham Lincoln by distinguished men of his time / collected and edited by Allen Thorndike Rice (1853-1889). New York: Harper & Brothers Publishers, 1909. This story is found on page 242. Remarkably, the book is still available in an edition from the University of Michigan Press. More convenient for us, the University of Michigan has the entire text on-line, in the Collected Works of Abraham Lincoln, an on-line source whose whole text is searchable. However, Lincoln does not tell the story about a dog — he uses a calf. Rice's book is a collection of reminiscences of others, exactly as the title suggests. Among those doing the reminiscing are ex-president and Gen. U. S. Grant, Massachusetts Gov. Benjamin Butler (also a former Member of Congress), Charles A. Dana the editor and former Assistant Secretary of War, and several others. In describing Lincoln and the Emancipation Proclamation, George W. Julian relates the story. Julian was a Free-Soil Party leader and a Member of Congress during Lincoln's administration. Julian's story begins on page 241: Few subjects have been more debated and less understood than the Proclamation of Emancipation. Mr. Lincoln was himself opposed to the measure, and when he very reluctantly issued the preliminary proclamation in September, 1862, he wished it distinctly understood that the deportation of the slaves was, in his mind, inseparably connected with the policy. Like Mr. Clay and other prominent leaders of the old Whig party, he believed in colonization, and that the separation of the two races was necessary to the welfare of both. He was at that time pressing upon the attention of Congress a scheme of colonization in Chiriqui, in Central America, which Senator Pomeroy espoused with great zeal, and in which he had the favor of a majority of the Cabinet, including Secretary Smith, who warmly indorsed the project. Subsequent developments, however, proved that it was simply an organization for land-stealing and plunder, and it was abandoned; but it is by no means certain that if the President had foreseen this fact his preliminary notice to the rebels would have been given. There are strong reasons for saying that he doubted his right to emancipate under the war power, and he doubtless meant what he said when he compared an Executive order to that effect to "the Pope's Bull against the comet." In discussing the question, he used to liken the case to that of the boy who, when asked how many legs his calf would have if he called its tail a leg, replied, " Five," to which the prompt response was made that calling the tail a leg would not make it a leg. I believe it is fair to call the story "confirmed." It's not an exact quote, but it's an accurate story. Please share: Advertisements	1

Consider the paddy wagon. From the mid-19th century through the mid-20th, this was the common term for the vehicles in which police hauled convicts and arrestees to jails, courts and prisons. Consider, now, the origin of the term. The "paddies" were Irish immigrants, who were flocking to the United States in the 1840s and '50s, fleeing the great famine that had descended on Ireland. And the Irish, some right-thinking Protestant Americans believed, were inherently a criminal bunch. In the 1840s and '50s, there were enough of those right-thinking Americans to form a political party: the American Party, they called it, though (because when asked about their doings, many apparently paranoid members responded, "I know nothing") it soon came to be known as the Know Nothings. With Irish and German immigrants flooding into the country (the Germans largely fleeing the repression that followed the failed revolutions of 1848), the Know Nothings experienced a brief surge of popularity until the far greater conflict between slave states and free states led to a more fundamental reshuffling of political parties. Some Know Nothings drifted into the ranks of the newly formed Republican Party. One early GOP leader, Abraham Lincoln, did everything he could to squelch their influence and make clear that German, Irish and all other immigrants were welcome additions to the party and the nation. Like most immigrant groups, the Irish took the hardest, most thankless jobs — building railroads, for instance. Nonetheless, the nativist leaders of the time — the 1850s version of Fox News chief Roger Ailes — insisted that guys with names like Hannity and O'Reilly were inherently disposed to crime and violence, undeterred by the absence of data that backed up their claims. 'Twas ever thus. Italians were criminals or anarchists; Jews were criminals (as in "The Great Gatsby") or communists; Mexicans, if you believe Donald Trump, are rapists and murderers. Never mind, as a recent voluminous study by the National Academy of Sciences makes clear, that the linkage between immigrants and crime is not merely fictitious but actually inverse: After close statistical analysis, the study concludes, "Immigrants are in fact much less likely to commit crime than natives, and the presence of large numbers of immigrants seems to lower crime rates." Based on the findings of at least 30 academic papers, the study concludes that foreign-born young men have an incarceration rate that is one-fourth that of native-born, and that "neighborhoods with greater concentrations of immigrants have lower rates of crime and violence" than other socioeconomically equivalent neighborhoods. Indeed, the growing number of the foreign-born over the past quarter-century goes a long way to explaining the huge drop in crime and violence that the nation has experienced during that time. The number of murders in New York City dropped from 2,245 in 1990 to 328 last year; in Los Angeles County it fell from 1,944 in 1993 to 551 last year, even as the number and share of their foreign-born residents skyrocketed. Nationally, in 2014 violent crime rates were at their lowest level in 20 years, according to the FBI. The immigrant crime wave that right-wing media and many Republican politicians rail about, then, is either a figment of their imaginations or an article of faith that, whatever their individual beliefs, they seek to instill or inflame in their followers. These beliefs are as valid as their predecessors' claims that the Irish or the Chinese, say, posed a danger to the United States and that no more of them should be allowed in. They are in the grand tradition of Madison Grant's hugely influential 1916 book "The Passing of the Great Race," which argued that the "Nordics" of Northwestern Europe were a superior race to Southern and Eastern Europeans (Italians, Jews, Greeks et al.), and that immigration from anyplace other than Northwest Europe should be banned. In 1924, Congress did just that, enacting a law that effectively restricted immigration from all but the "Nordic" nations, a law that stayed on the books until the Great Society Congress of 1965 repealed it. So to those who want to repeal birthright citizenship and send those dangerous Mexicans back to their homeland: Why stop there? Donald Trump's claims about the dangers posed by Mexicans are no more valid than Madison Grant's about the Italian and Jewish menace, or the Know Nothings' about the criminal tendencies of the Irish.

It's not exactly a secret that Peter Molyneux/22cans deity simulator, Godus is coming to iOS. However, we were able to learn about a few more specifics here at GDC. Godus was really designed with mobile in mind from the beginning, and it shows when watching the game in motion. "My passion has been to reinvent a genre of games I stumbled upon back in the early 90s called Populous," said Peter Molyneux, "I wanted to reinvent the genre around this beautiful, wonderful, incredible device. What you've got here is a god game reinvented for this touch device, and reinvented for the audience." What's more, the game will feature a sort of continuous form of multiplayer - kind of like an MMO. When you play, you're playing with however many other players/gods are on at that moment (possibly into the tens of millions), all at the same time. And all of their lands are connected as a part of one extremely large and continuous world filled with other islands and other gods. This even carries over into the game's cross-platform functionality as changes made to your land on the iPad, iPhone, or PC will display in real time on any of the other platforms. "You're connected to thousands, even millions, of people," explained Molyneux, "We tried this out on this crazy app called Curiosity, and we connected together hundreds of thousands of people who simultaneously touched on the cube. Well now we're connecting millions of people together. We did a cube, and now we're doing this vast planet." It's also been confirmed that Godus will be free to download for iOS, but no specifics have been given on its approach to monetization. The plan is to encourage players to want to spend money, but not force or require them to. "I love free to download. I never want to go back to having to pay money before having an idea if I'll like something," stated Molyneux. "What we have to do is get people to want to spend money, rather than need to spend money," he continued, "I'm inspired by the way that the supermarket, especially American supermarkets, tempt you to spend money. We call it 'Invest-to-Play'." Personally I'm rather curious to see how all of this will work in practice. Godus will be soft-launching in select territories (New Zealand, The Philippines, Sweden, Ireland, and Denmark) within the next few weeks.	1
Abstract Background: Previous studies have demonstrated that methamphetamine abuse leads to memory deficits and these are associated with relapse. Furthermore, extensive evidence indicates that nicotine prevents and/or improves memory deficits in different models of cognitive dysfunction and these nicotinic effects might be mediated by hippocampal or cortical nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. The present study investigated whether nicotine attenuates methamphetamine-induced novel object recognition deficits in rats and explored potential underlying mechanisms. Methods: Adolescent or adult male Sprague-Dawley rats received either nicotine water (10–75 μg/mL) or tap water for several weeks. Methamphetamine (4×7.5mg/kg/injection) or saline was administered either before or after chronic nicotine exposure. Novel object recognition was evaluated 6 days after methamphetamine or saline. Serotonin transporter function and density and α4β2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor density were assessed on the following day. Results: Chronic nicotine intake via drinking water beginning during either adolescence or adulthood attenuated the novel object recognition deficits caused by a high-dose methamphetamine administration. Similarly, nicotine attenuated methamphetamine-induced deficits in novel object recognition when administered after methamphetamine treatment. However, nicotine did not attenuate the serotonergic deficits caused by methamphetamine in adults. Conversely, nicotine attenuated methamphetamine-induced deficits in α4β2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor density in the hippocampal CA1 region. Furthermore, nicotine increased α4β2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor density in the hippocampal CA3, dentate gyrus and perirhinal cortex in both saline- and methamphetamine-treated rats. Conclusions: Overall, these findings suggest that nicotine-induced increases in α4β2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the hippocampus and perirhinal cortex might be one mechanism by which novel object recognition deficits are attenuated by nicotine in methamphetamine-treated rats. Introduction Methamphetamine (METH) abuse is a significant public health problem with annual prevalence rate of abuse in 2013 in >1% of adolescents and young adults (Johnston et al., 2014). Extensive clinical evidence indicates that METH abuse causes significant neurocognitive deficits (Kalechstein et al., 2003, 2009; Gonzalez et al., 2004; Hoffman et al., 2006; Cherner et al., 2010; Casaletto et al., 2014). For example, episodic memory is reduced among participants with a history of METH abuse (approximately 11 years), as assessed by performance in learning and recall tests (Casaletto et al., 2014). METH users also present with deficits in learning, motor ability, and working memory tests (Cherner et al., 2010). Neurocognitive deficits occur not only in individuals currently using METH (Simon et al., 2000) but can also persist long after METH is discontinued (4 days to 7 months) (Kalechstein et al., 2003, 2009; Gonzalez et al., 2004; Hoffman et al., 2006; Cherner et al., 2010; Casaletto et al., 2014). Among the different types of neurocognitive deficits caused by METH abuse, METH-associated neurocognitive deficits are greater for episodic memory, executive functions, information processing speed, and motor skills and lesser for attention, working memory, and verbal fluency (Scott et al., 2007). Notably, relapse is associated with episodic memory deficits but not other types of cognitive dysfunction among METH abusers (Simon et al., 2004). In addition to its impact on cognition, METH abuse causes brain abnormalities in areas important for memory, such as the hippocampus and cortex. For example, Thompson et al. (2004) reported that METH abusers have 7.8% smaller hippocampal volumes than control subjects as assessed by MRI, and these deficits correlated with deficits in deficits on a word recall task. The integrity of hippocampal and cortical neurons can also be assessed by the binding of the serotonin transporter (SERT), a marker highly expressed in these neuronal regions (Lawrence et al., 1993; for review, see Meneses et al., 2011). Loss of presynaptic serotonergic markers such as SERT indicates loss of this population of presynaptic serotonergic terminals. Studies have reported significant loss of serotonergic markers in the hippocampus and cortex of individuals with cognitive dysfunction, such as in METH abuse or Alzheimer's disease (Chen et al., 1996; Sekine et al., 2006; Ouchi et al., 2009). For example, positron emission tomography scan revealed that SERT densities are reduced in several brain regions of abstinent METH abusers (Sekine et al., 2006). Novel object recognition (NOR) is an established preclinical model for evaluating recognition memory deficits (for review, see Kinnavane et al., 2014). This test relies on the instinct of rats to preferentially explore novel objects over familiar objects, thus requiring the animals to remember which object is familiar. The perir	1
Where is the Hillary Preference Cascade? It's now been 2 days since Don­ald Trump unof­fi­cially secured the GOP nom­i­na­tion but there is an inter­est­ing dynamic that is get­ting no attention. One of the signs that a race is over is some­thing called a pref­er­ence cas­cade. It's the point where it becomes appar­ent that a par­tic­u­lar can­di­date is going to win both and both pols and vot­ers start lin­ing up behind the per­son who is going to win (It's also worth not­ing the can­di­dates remem­ber who was with them before the cas­cade came, the true believ­ers, vs those who decided to join the parade when there was no other in town) but I digress. That more than any­thing else is why Don­ald Trump start­ing pulling over 50%, once peo­ple decided that Trump was going to win atti­tudes started to change, that's when you knew, press cov­er­age not with­stand­ing, bar­ing some­thing incred­i­ble it was all over. And that brings us to Bernie Sanders. Lost in all the com­mo­tion of Ted Cruz and then John Kasich drop­ping out of the GOP race after Indi­ana was Bernie Sanders chalk­ing up an unex­pected pri­mary win. Sanders told reporters this evening, "I under­stand that Sec­re­tary Clin­ton thinks that this cam­paign is over. I've got some bad news for her. I know all the pun­dits thought we were sup­posed to lose but that appar­ently is not what all the peo­ple of Indi­ana concluded." Sanders also scoffed at the idea that stay­ing in the race could hurt Democ­rats' chances against GOP front-​runner Don­ald Trump. "Not at all. Not at all," he said. He pointed to polls that showed vot­ers say­ing the pri­mary invig­o­rated the party. "I have no doubt, zero doubt that what we have done in this cam­paign, what we are doing now and what we will do in the next 6 weeks is good for the demo­c­ra­tic party and it will result in a higher voter turnout," he added. It will likely remain math­e­mat­i­cally pos­si­ble for Sanders to win the Demo­c­ra­tic nom­i­na­tion until at least June 7 because the large num­ber of superdel­e­gates, who over­whelm­ingly back Clin­ton now, but are free to change their minds. Clin­ton cur­rently needs to win 70 per­cent of remain­ing del­e­gates in order to clinch the Demo­c­ra­tic nom­i­na­tion using only pledged delegates. For quite a while the MSM has been declar­ing the Demo­c­rat race over, but oddly enough the vot­ers don't seem to agree, and more impor­tantly the nor­mal pref­er­ence cas­cade that would be the sure sign of a race that's been won just plain hasn't taken place. So let's review: Until Ted Cruz's defeat and deci­sion to pull out of the GOP race the media has main­tained that the GOP race was not over. Yet even with Bernie Sanders vic­tory in Indi­ana and the fact that Hillary needs 70% of the elected del­e­gates to win the nom­i­na­tion out­right the media has no prob­lem dub­bing Hillary the win­ner and com­pletely dis­miss­ing Bernie Sanders even though the vot­ers have shown no sign of the pref­er­ence cas­cade that would nor­mally fol­low a winner.

In two dramatic cliffhangers, Ryan Li beat Eric Lui in back-to-back games Friday to sweep the AGA Pro Qualification Tournament finals, becoming the American Go Association's fourth professional. Li had won their game in the round-robin section earlier in the week, so Friday's wins gave him a 3-0 sweep of the best-of-five finals (he only dropped one game in the entire tournament, against Matthew Burrall). Click here for results and game records and check out the AGA Facebook page for photos. "Eric was a really tough opponent," Li told the E-Journal after the final round. "I definitely felt a lot of pressure from him and just wanted to try my hardest, do my best and see what happens. It's still all sinking in." Li is in his third year at the University of Toronto, where he's studying physics. He's also an avid soccer player. His future go plans are a bit up in the air at the moment. "I had planned to play in the World Amateur Go Championships this year but of course now I can't do that," he said, laughing. "I am tremendously impressed with Ryan's progress since last year's pro tournament," said AGA President Andy Okun. "His poise and seriousness all week were a real inspiration, as was his steadiness during some truly grueling games." Okun also said that he was "pleased with the overall strength of the field; clearly we're onto something here." Lui took a solid cash lead early in the morning game and hundreds of viewers on KGS thought he seemed to be in a good position after deftly surviving Li's splitting attack. But Li kept up the pressure and as Lui went into byo-yomi, the game kept getting more and more complicated. Eventually, with the life and death of multiple groups at stake, several huge kos and even a seki, both players were battling the clock as well and in the end, Lui, behind on the board, lost on time as well. In the other two morning games, Jeremy Chiu's kill of Ben Lockhart's large central group evened the score at 1-1 in their battle for third place in the tournament, while Matthew Burrall's win against Daniel Gourdeau put him within one game of clinching fifth place (Gourdeau lost their match in the round-robin section earlier in the week). The afternoon game between Li and Lui was another no-holds-barred contest, closely followed by hundreds on KGS, who were also treated to a live commentary by Myungwan Kim 9P, with Andrew Jackson. The other two afternoon games were each decided by half a point, Lockhart defeating Chiu to take a 2-1 lead, and Matthew Burrall beating Gourdeau to claim fifth place. Lockhart and Chiu will continue their struggle for third place — and seed in the next pro tournament — in a game Saturday at 9:30a that will be broadcast on KGS; if a fifth game is needed it'll be played and broadcast at 4p (EST). - report/photos by Chris Garlock	1
Photo by Kevin Lamarque/Reuters Washington is coasting. For the past several years, chroniclers of the relationship between the president and Republicans in Congress have searched in vain for new ways to describe chaos. When chaos wasn't on order, the task was to find new ways to connote stasis—the lack of progress that filled the exhausted interregnum between periods of chaos. John Dickerson John Dickerson is a co-anchor of CBS This Morning, co-host of the Slate Political Gabfest, host of the Whistlestop podcast, and author of Whistlestop and On Her Trail. Now the job has changed a bit. Crisis budgeting that led to tense moments is largely gone, mostly because House Republicans have decided not to stage confrontations. That is healthy, but there seems to have been a collective decision that like the convalescent, no politician is going to risk tearing the stitches by doing much more than padding around the ward. No one is going to do anything big or risky. The pace of action is neither chaotic nor energetic but just shy of slipping on a Snuggie and settling in for a Lord of the Rings marathon. This is, of course, pathetic. Republicans and Democrats are both so frightened about creating fights within their own parties during an election year that they are leaving the big questions unanswered. Today, House Committee on Ways and Means Chairman Dave Camp put forward a set of fundamental tax reform proposals. It was the product of years of work between Camp, a Republican, and his Democratic counterpart in the Senate, Max Baucus. The two traveled across the country holding hearings, taking in mountains of input, and engaging in all the other kinds of activity that most people like to think of when they think of elected representatives doing their jobs. Advertisement  All that work is going nowhere. No one in either party wants to risk taking on the complicated and tricky issue that might offend big contributors or stir up voters in the wrong way. There will continue to be talk on both sides, but no one is going to get anything done. Budget expert Stan Collender thinks that means no action on this issue until 2019. The pace of action in Washington is just shy of slipping on a Snuggie and settling in for a Lord of the Rings marathon. Trade and immigration are two other items that have gone from the back burner to the freezer. House Speaker John Boehner won't start a fight in his party by bringing up immigration reform, and President Obama won't force his party to take up trade legislation that the president says will help the economy. The stakes are so low in Washington that Obama and Boehner could even sit down and meet again after a long pause. Tuesday, the two men talked for an hour in what was their longest noncrisis conversation in years. Boehner emerged calling it a "nice meeting" and then went back to beating up on the president and his health care law. So if nothing is going to get done, what did they talk about? Well, just because no one in Washington is going to do anything big or meaningful doesn't mean they have totally banished their chance to do a little something. Advertisement  There is a possibility that the appropriations process will actually take place in some form this year. Spending items may actually be considered by a committee in which people will have their say about the merits of each program. Although the big budget questions of our time—big new spending or entitlement reforms—are still out of the conversation, at least spending levels won't be determined by sequestration. There's also a slim chance that Congress might work together on the transportation bill, flood insurance, and a water resource bill in the way that members worked together to pass the farm bill. Those are not grand pieces of legislation, but they are what one top congressional aide calls the "meat and potatoes" of operating a government. A cynic might also call them the least lawmakers can be expected to do and still deserve the name. Of course, even limited progress is the optimistic view. Though the temperature has lowered and chaos is on pause, it's still possible that lawmakers could slip from risk-free coasting to a full-on coma. Given how few legislative days are scheduled for this election year, it may be impossible even to handle the meat-and-potato basics. Congress may, for example, once again resort to passing a continuing resolution instead of having a proper appropriations process.	1
The Los Angeles Lakers are in trouble. So are the Houston Rockets. And the Atlanta Hawks and Golden State Warriors may no longer have a chance. The Dallas Mavericks have emerged as front-runners in the Dwight Howard sweepstakes. That's the only conclusion we're left to draw after Brad Townsend of The Dallas Morning News (h/t CBS Sports) wrote that Dallas-Fort Worth-area Raising Cane's restaurants are prepared to load Howard up with protein for the rest of his life—for free: As the wooing of Dwight Howard officially begins, Dallas-Fort Worth-area Raising Cane's restaurants are offering free-agent center Howard food for thought – for the rest of his life. On Monday, Raising Cane's will kick off a campaign inviting Mavericks fans to help persuade Howard to sign with Dallas. The company has leased six electronic billboards to help publicize its cooked-up offer to Howard. Raising Cane's marketing manager Adam Reed says that if Howard signs with the Mavericks, "he will be welcome to come by any of our (20) local restaurants to enjoy seriously delicious chicken fingers at any time, on us, for the rest of his life." Howard's first thought: Where do I sign? Free chicken fingers are no joke. They're delicious, and also expensive. At least, over the course of Howard's life they would be. Townsend posits that if Superman were to hit the drive-through once a day for the rest of his life, Raising Cane's would be on the hook for anywhere between $192,628 and $530,621 worth of chicken. That's quite the signing bonus. A cursory once-over of Larry Coon's CBA FAQ reveals that there is nothing against fast-food joints offering lucratively edible incentives to other teams' players before the NBA's free-agency period officially begins. So neither Raising Cane's nor Mark Cuban should be fined for tampering. Instead, the rest of Howard's suitors must now scramble in every direction, searching for a way to match this incredible negotiating ploy. Perhaps the Lakers could offer Dwight the opportunity to chase championships and taste the rainbow, bestowing upon him a lifetime supply of Skittles. Maybe the Hawks can appeal to Howard by landing him an endorsement with the pizzeria of his choosing, as he once revealed those slices of heaven were his favorite food. And if I'm analytics guru Daryl Morey, I'm poring over video footage of Howard's chocolate-chip cookie talents and getting Nestle Toll House to roll out the red carpet before the league's moratorium period is lifted. The rest of his suitors could also keep it simple. Free chicken is already the standard: All they have to do is find a restaurant willing to match and get it to toss in unlimited dipping sauces. I can't tell you how many free-agency coups I suspect have been decided by an extra cup of ranch or another meal-time dressing. Though each member of the Miami Heat's Big Three took a (slight) pay cut in 2010, I'm convinced there was an never-ending supply of honey mustard involved to help offset the monetary difference. In related news, I'm starving. Please excuse me while I go work on my jump shot in hopes of one day making it to the NBA and being compensated with an ever-replenishing reservoir of deep-fried poultry. Follow @danfavale	1
The Austrian branch of T-Mobile is refusing to block access to The Pirate Bay and several other popular torrent sites. T-Mobile was asked to do so by a local music rights group, who want the ISP to voluntarily follow a court order that was issued against rival Internet provider A1. As the poster-child of online piracy, The Pirate Bay has become one of the most censored websites on the Internet in recent years. Most recently the Austrian Internet provider A1 was ordered by the Commercial Court of Vienna to block subscriber access to The Pirate Bay. In addition to various domain names of the notorious torrent site, the court order also requires the Internet provider to block three other "structurally infringing" sites; Isohunt.to, 1337x.to and h33t.to. Taking advantage of this momentum, local music rights group LSG sent its lawyers after several other large ISPs urging them to follow suit, or else. A letter with a 'demand' to block The Pirate Bay and others was sent T-Mobile and Drei, among others. However, without a court order directed at them the providers are not all eager to comply. Helmut Spudich, spokesman for T-Mobile, says that his company has no plans to implement new blocking measures. "We will not to comply with this request and access to The Pirate Bay will not be blocked," Spudich told Futurezone. The decision of the Commercial Court of Vienna only applies to A1, so T-Mobile sees no legal obligation to comply with the request. Instead, T-Mobile notes that the authorities "should implement clear legal regulations with regard to Internet blocking in Austria." "We don't want to block our customers to be blocked inadvertently and would like a clarification on the correct procedure," Spudich adds. Several other Austrian Internet providers have received the same letter but thus far none have publicly stated that they are prepared to voluntarily block The Pirate Bay on their network. The Pirate Bay is not the first site to be targeted in Austria. Earlier this year the Supreme Court ordered several leading Austrian ISPs to block the major streaming sites Movie4K.to and Kinox.to. This order also clarified that the Internet providers will have to pay the costs for future blockades, which may make ISPs more hesitant to comply without protest. Whether copyright holders will indeed take T-Mobile and other ISPs to court to broaden the existing blockade has yet to be seen. Update August 28: According to Futurezone none of the large ISPs have started to voluntarily block the Pirate Bay before the ultimatum they were given.	1
Is the PHI on all your mobile devices encrypted? If not, here's another two million reasons to make encryption your top priority. The Office of Civil Rights (OCR) of the Department of Health and Human Services announced on April 22, 2014 that they had imposed nearly $2 million in penalties on two entities as a result of the theft of unencrypted laptops. As previously noted in this blog, theft or loss of laptops or other portable electronic devices remains a predominant factor in HIPAA breaches, constituting 57.5% of the approximately 400 List Breaches that involved reported theft or loss as of August 2013. In the first incident, Concentra Health Services was fined $1,725,220 and agreed to adopt a corrective action plan after an OCR investigation following a report of the theft of an unencrypted laptop from a physical therapy clinic. According to the press release, "OCR's investigation revealed Concentra had previously recognized in multiple risk analyses that a lack of encryption on its laptops, desktop computers, medical equipment, tablets and other devices containing electronic protected health information (ePHI) was a critical risk. While steps were taken to begin encryption, Concentra's efforts were incomplete and inconsistent over time leaving patient PHI vulnerable throughout the organization. OCR's investigation further found Concentra had insufficient security management processes in place to safeguard patient information." This isn't Concentra's first experience with laptop theft. The OCR list of Breaches Affecting 500 or More Individuals (also known as the "Wall of Shame") includes two prior similar incidents, one in 2009 and another in 2011. (It is unclear whether this theft was related to the 2011 incident). Modern Healthcare reports that Concentra reported 16 additional breaches involving fewer than 500 individuals' records. So, although 434 out of 597 laptops had been encrypted according to HealthITSecurity.com, a batting average of .726 wasn't good enough given their status as repeat offenders. Concentra's resolution agreement, including the Corrective Action Plan, is available here and is worth reading. Among other conditions, OCR requires that the company provide an update regarding its encryption status, including the percentage of all Concentra devices and equipment (laptops, desktops, medical equipment, tablets, and other storage devices) that are encrypted and an explanation for the percentage of devices and equipment that are not encrypted. The company's incomplete and inadequate implementation of compliance steps after known vulnerabilities had been identified may also have contributed to the severity of the penalty. One of the worst things a covered entity or business associate can do is to engage in a half-hearted compliance effort that documents knowledge of uncorrected problems. In the second case, Arkansas-based QCA Health Plan reported the theft of an unencrypted laptop containing records of 148 individuals. OCR noted that its investigation revealed that QCA failed to comply with multiple requirements of the HIPAA Privacy and Security Rules, beginning from the compliance date of the Security Rule in April 2005 and ending in June 2012. QCA agreed to pay $250,000 and implement upgraded security procedures and employee training. QCA's Resolution Agreement and Corrective Action Plan is here. This case marks only the second time OCR has fined an entity for a breach involving less than 500 individuals' PHI, following the Hospice of North Idaho settlement. One lesson is clear from both incidents: if these laptops had been encrypted in accordance with NIST standards, neither entity would have been subjected to fines and additional government oversight. As enforcement continues to ramp up and target both Covered Entities and Business Associates, and as the use of mobile devices continues to increase, there is no excuse to delay full implementation of encryption. Encryption isn't a panacea, but it's as close as you can get in the HIPAA compliance world.	1
Arctic light paints granite slabs with light In this photo and the one to the right you can get a good sense of the quality of midday light in the Arctic, I can't put my finger on it quite yet but it makes it much easier to find beautiful images at several different times of day. I think part of it is the quality of atmosphere, its often thickened slightly with clouds that have been frozen mid-puff and are in the process of filtering out and blowing through vast empty space.	1
Comparison with … Source files ( source ) Because of this package's design, modules can directly replace source statements in code; in most cases, source( ' relative/path/file.r ' ) can be replaced by import( ' relative/path/file ' , attach = TRUE ) – albeit with marked improvements: Module content is loaded into its own private environment, akin to setting the local=TRUE option. It thus avoids polluting the global environment. Since modules are environments, a module's content can be listed easily via ls(modulename) , and R shells provide auto-completion when writing modulename$ and pressing Tab repeatedly. Modules can be executed directly (via Rscript module.r or similar) or import ed. Unlike via source , a module knows when it's being import ed, which allows code to be executed conditionally only when it is executed directly: if (is.null(module_name())) { … } This is of course similar to Python's if __name__ == '__main__': … mechanism. module_name returns a module's name. Module source files which are being executed directly don't act as modules and hence have no name ( module_name() is NULL ). Modules can import other modules relative to their own path, without having to chdir to the module's path (similar to the source option chdir=TRUE , but preserving getwd() ). import uses a standardised, customisable search path to locate modules, making it easy to reuse source files across projects without having to copy them around. Repeatedly import ing, even in different modules, loads the module only once. This makes it particularly well-suited for structuring projects into small, decomposable units. This project was mainly borne out of the frustration that is repeatedly source ing the same file, or alternatively having one "master header" file which includes all other source files. Doc comments inside a module source file are parsed during import , and interactive help on module contents is subsequently available via the usual mechanisms (e.g. ?mod$fun ). All module source files are assumed to be encoded as UTF-8, which is nowadays the only sane default. Packages ( library ) Modules are conceived as a lightweight alternative to packages (see rationale). As such, modules are generally intended to be more lightweight than packages. Most importantly, modules often consist of single source code files. Modules do not need a DESCRIPTION file or similar. Modules offer more stringent protection against name clashes. While attaching to the R search() path is supported, it's not the default, and (like in Python), it's generally discouraged in favour of explicitly qualifying accesses to the module with the module name (or an alias). Changing a module does not necessitate a module reinstall, the changes are available directly to clients (and even to running sessions, via reload ). Modules can be local to a project. This allows structuring projects internally, something that packages only allow at coarse level. In particular, modules can be nested as in Python to create hierarchies, and this is in fact encouraged. As of now, there is no support for non-R code or dynamic libraries (but one may of course use facilities such as dyn.load and Rcpp to include compiled code). Control over exported and imported symbols is less fine-grained than for packages with namespace for now. This is intentional, since modules handle namespaces (via environments) more stringently than packages by default. However, this might still change in the future to allow more control. Python's import mechanism R modules are heavily inspired by Python modules, but embedded in R syntax.	1
Recently, Google delivered on a big promise made at its 2016 I/O developer conference, releasing a version of Android Auto that would run directly on a phone, removing the need for a new car or costly aftermarket head unit to access the service. Later this week, at CES in Last Vegas, the company will demonstrate another aspect of its automotive aspirations announced at I/O: Android running right in the car. Google and FCA have partnered to create a concept Chrysler 300 that runs Android 7.0, a.k.a. Nougat. The open-source OS will be powering a version of FCA's 8.4-inch Uconnect system, sitting behind the scenes and still offering the "unique and intuitive" interface that allows Chrysler to differentiate its infotainment offerings. The rising popularity of systems like Android Auto and has threatened auto manufacturers' control of the dashboards of their own cars. This is an important detail. The rising popularity of systems like Android Auto and Apple CarPlay, which look the same regardless of where they run, has threatened auto manufacturers' control of the dashboards of their own cars. The ability to customize the interface of an in-dash version of Android could provide the apps and connectivity that owners want while maintaining the distinct look that manufacturers feel they need. There are plenty of cars running some flavor Android already, but that's typically buried behind the scenes. With this implementation, full-on Android apps will be available from within the dash, including Google offerings like Assistant and Maps, along with popular third-party selections like Spotify and the ubiquitous Pandora. This is only a concept and only on display at CES over the coming week, so don't head to your local Chrysler dealership asking for Nougat just yet. However, it is a good sign pointing toward more flavorful infotainment systems to come.	1
If you want to analyse anything over time, there is likely no more important table to create for any Power BI model that a great date table. I rarely, if ever, run any time analysis over date tables in fact tables. I always create a date table and then build a relationship over to the fact table (like a sales data table). Why should you do this? Well, there are a few reasons, which I go into in this video. The key, though, is learning how to create a really good date table, fast. You want to make sure that you have all the right code in place to do this over and over again. A date table can be created in a few ways. In this example I use the 'M' code within the query editor. I personally think this is a really efficient way to do it, because you can make other small changes to the table within the query editor at the same time. This video shows you how you can do just that, and how you can do it really quickly in all your models. ***** Learning Power BI? ***** All Enterprise DNA TV Resources FREE COURSE – Ultimate Beginners Guide To Power BI FREE COURSE – Ultimate Beginners Guide To DAX FREE – Power BI Resources	1
"Did you know you can actually negotiate and get a better deal at the doctor's office if you offer to pay up front?" co-founder and CEO of Collective Health Ali Diab asks. He'd broken his foot and had to go to the doctor for an MRI that would have cost him $3,700, with a $1,500 deductible. Instead it cost just $600 in cash that day. He says that's because he paid for it without going through his insurance provider. This is part of what gave him the idea for Collective Health, a new Founders Fund-backed employer health program launching today. It promises to take the paperwork and runaround out of health insurance. Diab and co-cofounder Dr. Rajaie Batniji, a physician and political economist at Stanford University, paint Collective Health as a way to cut out the middleman (health insurance) and instead offer employers a less expensive, cloud-based, a la cart version of health care coverage for their workers. Employers can pick and choose which things they want covered for their employees. "We're not building another health app or gadget. We're building a complete solution to replace your employer provided health insurance," says Diab. Founders Fund led an undisclosed Series A to back the idea. Formation 8, the Social+Capital Partnership, and prominent angel investors including Scott Banister, Max Levchin, Jeremy Stoppelman and Amr Awadallah also added money in support. The other part for the idea for Collective Health was first planted when Diab's intestine suddenly twisted up on itself, cutting off the blood supply to about 10 feet of his intestine. "Nothing could have prevented or predicted this. It was just bad luck," says Diab. To have that happen is a scary and life threatening experience. And then, just as he was struggling to regain his strength, his health insurer didn't want to pay his fees. Diab says he'd been paying for premium coverage for years in the event of something like this happening. Instead of the help he needed, he was left with papers up to his gut in legalese and medical insurance loop-de-loops he didn't understand. It was either pay up or face legal action, ruined credit and further unnecessary hardship. Diab's story is not unique. Dr. Batniji has seen it over and over again while working in the medical field. "Patients are often left to advocate for themselves and trying to get a clear answer from your health insurance company about what's driving costs is impossible," says Dr. Batniji. According to NerdWallet, one in every 5 American adults are struggling to pay their medical bills, and three in five bankruptcies will be due to medical bills. And to add more insult to any possible injuries, over the last 10 years, the average premium for family coverage has increased 80 percent, according to ACA International. It was a 90 percent increase from 2008 to 2009, according to data provided from Wellpoint, Cigna and United Health (see chart below). The problem, according to Diab and Dr. Batniji, is that even with Obamacare or employee sponsored health insurance, annual premiums are increasing. They say the costs are growing at an unsustainable rate for most small and midsize companies to handle. This, according to Diab, makes it hard to offer a good plan for employees. "While insurance is supposed to be a risk­-sharing business, health insurance has increasingly become a middleman business devised to generate profit for the health insurers above all else. As a result, there is a fundamental disconnect between the incentives of traditional health insurance companies and people's and organizations' health insurance needs," says Diab. Diab and Dr. Batniji started asking questions like "Why have insurance premiums and deductibles risen so much faster than underlying health care costs over the past twenty years?" and "Why do we receive something in the mail after seeing the doctor that looks like a bill, but says 'THIS IS NOT A BILL' at the top?" "It's like entering a time warp back to 1980," Diab says. Several long bike rides and early morning coffees later, Dr. Batniji and Diab decided it was up to them to figure out a better way to fixing how Americans pay for health care. The startup now employs 25 people in a San Mateo office and Collective Health is currently "renting" insurance services off of a certain network that it is not at liberty to name at this time. Payments processing is also in the works and Diab says it will eventually be like a square or pay pall software. Collective Health also adds in cost comparisons and which doctors are in your network. It also includes a data visualization element not currently offered by any health insurance provider. The data shows you how much you can expect to pay, above your premium. This, says Diab, better prepares someone for what it should cost than just mailing something	1
Whoring is like military service…okay in the upper brackets, not so good lower down. – Robert A. Heinlein Many Americans like to pretend that all prostitutes are streetwalkers. I say "pretend" because, though I am sure there are some ill-informed folks out there who simply don't know any better, I am equally sure the vast majority of people in this country know of the existence of call girls, escorts, massage parlor girls, brothel girls, lawyers and other types of prostitutes. Yet, even so, say "prostitute" to the average American and the picture that will pop into his (or her) mind is the stereotypical underdressed, overly made up streetwalker leaning against a lamp post and smoking a cigarette. Ignore for a minute that this stereotype isn't even true of many streetwalkers; the real question is, why? How is it that the word "prostitute", broad and clinical as it is, has come to mean for most Americans only those women at the very bottom of our profession? I can't be sure of all the reasons, but I have some educated guesses I would like to share with you. First and foremost, of course, is that streetwalkers are ubiquitous. To my knowledge no one has ever done a world census of whores, but The National Task Force on Prostitution estimates that, of the entire female prostitute community in America, only five to twenty percent are street walkers (that's an average estimate of 12.5%, so let's be generous and say 15%). And unlike the brothel girls and massage girls (who are only encountered in their own places of business) or call girls and escorts (who are difficult to tell apart from other women), streetwalkers stand out; they're hard to miss when they're present. Since they have no advertising and/or place of business, how else could they attract clientele? They have to be visible, and they have to advertise their profession so as not to be overlooked. Hence, the flashy and/or revealing clothes favored by many (though by no means all) of them. On top of that, they are more thinly spread; I daresay there are a few streetwalkers in many towns too small for a massage parlor or escort service. All the streetwalker needs to set up shop is a pair of shoes. It's quite likely that just about everyone reading this has seen a few streetwalkers in his life (probably more than just a few), and since they do stand out they make a strong impression. It is the nature of the human mind to stereotype, which is of course how prejudices are formed. It is unfortunately not much of a leap for a person to go from "I saw some prostitutes who looked like sleazy drug addicts" to "all prostitutes are sleazy drug addicts." Or to go from "I read in the paper that many crimes are committed by black men" to "all black men are criminals." And so on. Even if the rational mind knows that not ALL members of a group are like its lowest elements, the temptation to classify any given member of that group as the lowest common denominator is very strong indeed. And when the people who are doing the stereotyping are in positions of authority, abominations like racial profiling are the inevitable result. Another source of the stereotype is movies and television shows. The Hollywood prostitute is a curious creature; she looks like a call girl but dresses and acts like a streetwalker (except for her heart of gold). This applies only to main characters, of course; seedy-looking streetwalkers may be added to a street scene to give it a more run-down, low-class, skid row sort of atmosphere. Once in a great while there will be a high-class call girl (or a courtesan if the show is set far enough in the past), but this is a very rare exception. In the universe of movies and television, streetwalkers outnumber the rest of us by many hundreds to one. And considering how tenacious visual images can be, this false picture is permanently imbedded in the minds of many people. Finally, there's the vulgar appeal of the streetwalker. Many people are fascinated by vulgarity; our youth idolizes entertainers who adopt the personas of "gangstas", thugs, "pimps", skinheads and other lowlifes. The tabloids dwell on the lowest, sleaziest activities of celebrities, especially those celebrities who are merely famous specimens of what I grew up calling "white trash." Television shows such as Jerry Springer, Cops and the numerous courtroom and "reality" shows present the worst, lowest, nastiest, sickest, most tawdry examples of human behavior as "entertainment". Vulgarity sells. And considering that, is it any surprise that most Americans would rather think about streetwalkers than call girls? So	1
By: Paul Goldberg, Staff Writer Australia's ruling party will once again attempt to resolve their bitter internal differences over the debate of same-sex marriage at a special meeting which was held Monday. The ruling party is desperate to find a policy agreement on same-sex marriage as it is being considered a test of prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull's agenda. Making matters worse is the fact that the ruling party has trailed the center-left opposition Labor Party over the past several months in opinion polls. The conservative Liberal Party-led coalition narrowly was re-elected at elections last July with a promise to let voters decide whether Australia should recognize same-sex marriage through a popular vote. Liberal Senator. Dean Smith, a gay man who opposed legalizing same-sex marriage when he was appointed to the Senate in 2012, has drafted a bill to allow gay marriage now and wants his fellow Liberal lawmakers to be allowed to vote on it according to their consciences rather than to according to party policy. "It's time for the party to put the matter to rest once and for all," Smith told reporters on Monday. Gay marriage opponents, including former Prime Minister Tony Abbott who initiated the plebiscite policy two year ago, argue that the government must stick to its election promise that marriage law would not be changed without a national vote. "The last thing Australia needs is government by opinion poll," Abbott wrote in The Australian newspaper. "But neither do we need political parties that believe one thing one minute and the opposite the next," said Abbott. Turnbull continues to support gay marriage and initially opposed the plebiscite concept. However Turnbull did agree to maintain the government's plebiscite policy in a deal with the most conservative lawmakers in his party when he replaced Abbott as prime minister in September 2015.	1
We're fighting for policy changes that will make it possible for us to have better choices: utilities that offer us renewable options, electric trains that make short-haul flights obsolete, public transit. Exxon and its ilk have been fighting for decades to keep these choices out of our reach, and then claim that we are voting with our dollars every time we sit in traffic or heat our homes with fossil fuels supplied by a utility that has a monopoly. They can play gotcha as much as they want, but all it proves is how badly we need better options. And we are still going to fight like heck to make sure options are available to everyone. And yet, for all that logic, I still find myself on edge. To be watched so much is a kind of never-ending nightmare. And sometimes it's just infuriating. I skipped the funeral this summer of Patrick Sorrento, an important mentor to me at my college newspaper, because I didn't want my minder to follow me and cause a distracting spectacle. When my daughter reports someone taking pictures of her at the airport, it drives me nuts. I have no idea if it's actually this outfit; common decency would suggest otherwise, but that seems an increasingly rare commodity. There's plenty else that scares me this summer, of course: Every month we're breaking temperature records, and Donald J. Trump has introduced a new snarl to our public life. Against these fears, the best one can hope for is a kind of resiliency. For a planet in desperate trouble, it's good news that the price of a solar panel has plummeted. For our nation, there's the hope that the social fabric — the Little Leagues and Methodist churches and Black Lives Matter assemblies and League of Women Voters and library guilds and N.A.A.C.P. chapters — remain just strong enough that we'll escape the narcissistic nihilism of Mr. Trump. As for me, there's comfort in the knowledge that the climate movement doesn't depend on me. For years now, I've been stepping back, mostly because I think the kind of movement we need is one that has thousands of leaders in thousands of places, connected like the solar panels on the roofs of an entire planet. It's stronger that way, because different voices bring different arguments to the fore. But another good reason for that distributed model, one that I've thought of often this summer, is that even a successful attack on one person does little damage to the whole movement, in the same way that you can smash the solar panels on my roof and not black out the Eastern Seaboard. When that doesn't cheer me up sufficiently, I fall back on my colleagues all over the world. A good thing about movements is that you really do have brothers and sisters, and they do have your back. The fossil-fuel industry may threaten us as a planet, as a nation, and as individuals, but when we rise up together we've got a fighting chance against the powers that be. And perhaps that realization is just a little bit scary for them.	1
Dan Talks About Joss Whedon. And Talks. And Talks. ~ "What we're offering you is a clean slate." "Have you ever actually tried to clean a slate? You can always see what was on it."  It's slavery  Being a Doll sounds great  If they'd had it in my day, I'd have had Betty Grable every night  [incoherent girlish giggling]  "I think it could be maybe beautiful"  It's human trafficking, end of story  If this technology exists then: "it'll be used. It'll be abused. It'll be global. And we will be over. As a species. We will cease to matter. I don't know, maybe we should"  "But if you put her under some fat old Emir, that's different, because she'll think she loves him for all of a day? We're in the business of using people!" So I finally got around to watching Dollhouse. I'm writing this article as I go, episode by episode, so you can expect it to get a bit incoherent and a bit rambling.Obviously I went into the show with a fair few preconceptions about what it was going to be like, and it would be remiss of me not to admit that this coloured my experience of it.I should also say that I am in no way disputing the fact that Joss Whedon makes excellent TV. The problem is that he makes excellent TV which sometimes whacks you in the face with a gigantic disembodied penis with the words "look how serious and morally complex I am" tattooed on the side.Got that image firm in your minds? Good.Also. Spoilers.The first episode opens with a fragment of Echo's induction into the Dollhouse. Something bad has happened, and the Dollhouse is willing to make it all go away if she'll sign up for a five year mission to explore strange new … umm … to work for them for five years.There's a bit of classic Whedonesque dialogue in this scene which set my teeth on edge. It goes something like this:Two things. No. Three things:First. Stepfrom the Themehammer. Okay, we get it, they're going to erase her personality but because of her Awesome Girlpower they won't succeed. Fabulous. You don't need to drive it into my head like a railroad spike.Second. Okay, Joss, we know you like playing with language, we know you like deconstructing metaphors (he's like Pratchett in this regard) but really "have you ever tried to clean a slate" what theThird. Who the fucktried to clean a slate? Was Echo some kind of slate-studies graduate? Was she majoring in sedimentary rock formations? About the only people I can think of who would work with slate regularly are art students, and in that case you'd think they'd view a "clean slate" as something like a "clean piece of paper" – something completely new rather than something that has had the old stuff scrubbed off of it. In fact, surely that's why one needs a "clean slate" – because one's old slate is dirty from all the stuff that's been on it.Sorry, that was a massive digression.So we go on from Echo being spunkily inducted into the Dollhouse to Echo riding around spunkily on a motorbike, where she flirts spunkily with this rich dude who she appears to have been having an awesome weekend of hot bondagey sex with. Then he goes to get a drink, and she goes spunkily outside and gets into a spunky black van, where she is taken back to the Dollhouse for her "treatment".As she goes, the hot billionaire likens her to Cinderella at the ball, getting back into her coach before it turns into a pumpkin.Back at the Dollhouse, she talks animatedly about how happy she is, and how glad she is that she's finally found the right guy. Then they wipe her brain. Then there is aof exposition.I'm not going to go too far into the "is it rape or isn't it" question right now – I'm sure there'll be time to cover that later. What I am going to mention is the way that this is presented.Echo's "Engagement" (as the Dollhouse insists on calling it) with Rich Dude is presented in an unremittingly positive light. She's happy, he's happy, it's just All Over Too Soon and she has to go back to the Magic Kingdom to be put into her Enchanted Sleep. The only flaw presented in the scenario is the fact that it is not "real". The fact that Echo spent three days having sex with this guy because she had been compelled to do so by high-tech mind control is not addressed – not merely addressed ambiguously	1

Background Substantial concerns have been raised about the neuropsychiatric safety of the smoking cessation medications varenicline and bupropion. Their efficacy relative to nicotine patch largely relies on indirect comparisons, and there is limited information on safety and efficacy in smokers with psychiatric disorders. We compared the relative neuropsychiatric safety risk and efficacy of varenicline and bupropion with nicotine patch and placebo in smokers with and without psychiatric disorders. Methods We did a randomised, double-blind, triple-dummy, placebo-controlled and active-controlled (nicotine patch; 21 mg per day with taper) trial of varenicline (1 mg twice a day) and bupropion (150 mg twice a day) for 12 weeks with 12-week non-treatment follow-up done at 140 centres (clinical trial centres, academic centres, and outpatient clinics) in 16 countries between Nov 30, 2011, and Jan 13, 2015. Participants were motivated-to-quit smokers with and without psychiatric disorders who received brief cessation counselling at each visit. Randomisation was computer generated (1:1:1:1 ratio). Participants, investigators, and research personnel were masked to treatment assignments. The primary endpoint was the incidence of a composite measure of moderate and severe neuropsychiatric adverse events. The main efficacy endpoint was biochemically confirmed continuous abstinence for weeks 9–12. All participants randomly assigned were included in the efficacy analysis and those who received treatment were included in the safety analysis. The trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (number NCT01456936 ) and is now closed. Findings 8144 participants were randomly assigned, 4116 to the psychiatric cohort (4074 included in the safety analysis) and 4028 to the non-psychiatric cohort (3984 included in the safety analysis). In the non-psychiatric cohort, 13 (1·3%) of 990 participants reported moderate and severe neuropsychiatric adverse events in the varenicline group, 22 (2·2%) of 989 in the bupropion group, 25 (2·5%) of 1006 in the nicotine patch group, and 24 (2·4%) of 999 in the placebo group. The varenicline–placebo and bupropion–placebo risk differences (RDs) for moderate and severe neuropsychiatric adverse events were −1·28 (95% CI −2·40 to −0·15) and −0·08 (−1·37 to 1·21), respectively; the RDs for comparisons with nicotine patch were −1·07 (−2·21 to 0·08) and 0·13 (−1·19 to 1·45), respectively. In the psychiatric cohort, moderate and severe neuropsychiatric adverse events were reported in 67 (6·5%) of 1026 participants in the varenicline group, 68 (6·7%) of 1017 in the bupropion group, 53 (5·2%) of 1016 in the nicotine patch group, and 50 (4·9%) of 1015 in the placebo group. The varenicline–placebo and bupropion–placebo RDs were 1·59 (95% CI −0·42 to 3·59) and 1·78 (−0·24 to 3·81), respectively; the RDs versus nicotine patch were 1·22 (−0·81 to 3·25) and 1·42 (−0·63 to 3·46), respectively. Varenicline-treated participants achieved higher abstinence rates than those on placebo (odds ratio [OR] 3·61, 95% CI 3·07 to 4·24), nicotine patch (1·68, 1·46 to 1·93), and bupropion (1·75, 1·52 to 2·01). Those on bupropion and nicotine patch achieved higher abstinence rates than those on placebo (OR 2·07 [1·75 to 2·45] and 2·15 [1·82 to 2·54], respectively). Across cohorts, the most frequent adverse events by treatment group were nausea (varenicline, 25% [511 of 2016 participants]), insomnia (bupropion, 12% [245 of 2006 participants]), abnormal dreams (nicotine patch, 12% [251 of 2022 participants]), and headache (placebo, 10% [199 of 2014 participants]). Efficacy treatment comparison did not differ by cohort. Interpretation The study did not show a significant increase in neuropsychiatric adverse events attributable to varenicline or bupropion relative to nicotine patch or placebo. Varenicline was more effective than placebo, nicotine patch, and bupropion in helping smokers achieve abstinence, whereas bupropion and nicotine patch were more effective than placebo.

Why do Santa's reindeer fly? The role of ancient mushroom-using shamans by Mark Adams These red and white mushrooms, Amanita muscaria, were found in an alpine forest around Creede, Colorado. A. muscaria was the "sacred mushroom" used by the ancient tribal peoples of pre-Christian northern Europe. Its bright coloring suggests the colors of Santa's garments and of holiday lights. Although most people see Christmas as a Christian holiday, most of the symbols and icons we associate with Christmas celebrations are actually derived from the shamanistic traditions of the tribal peoples of pre-Christian northern Europe. The sacred mushroom of these people was the red and white Amanita muscaria, also known as "fly agaric." This mushroom commonly is seen in books of fairy tales and usually is associated with magic and fairies. It contains potent hallucinogenic compounds once used by ancient peoples for insight and transcendental experiences. Most of the major elements of the modern Christmas celebration, such as Santa Claus, Christmas trees, magical reindeer and the giving of gifts, are originally based upon the traditions surrounding the harvest and consumption of this most sacred mushroom. The World Tree  Ancient peoples, including the Lapps of modern-day Finland, and the Koyak tribes of the central Russian steppes, believed in the idea of a World Tree. The World Tree was seen as a kind of cosmic axis onto which the planes of the universe are fixed. The roots of the World Tree stretch down into the underworld, its trunk is the "middle earth" of everyday existence, and its branches reach upwards into the heavenly realm. Amanita muscaria grows only under certain types of trees, mostly firs and evergreens. The cap of the mushroom is the fruit of the larger mycelium beneath the soil which exists in a symbiotic relationship with the roots of the tree. To ancient people, this mushroom was literally "the fruit of the tree." The North Star was also considered sacred, since all other stars in the sky revolved around its fixed point. They associated this "Pole Star" with the World Tree and the central axis of the universe. The top of the World Tree touched the North Star, and the spirit of the shaman would climb the metaphorical tree, thereby passing into the realm of the gods. This is the true meaning of the star on top of the modern Christmas tree, and also the reason that the super-shaman Santa makes his home at the North Pole. Ancient peoples were amazed at how this magical mushroom sprang from the earth without any visible seed. They considered this "virgin birth" to have been the result of the morning dew, which was seen as the "semen of the deity." The silver tinsel we drape onto our modern Christmas tree represents this divine fluid.  Origin of phrase, "to get pissed" The active ingredients of A. muscaria are not metabolized by the body, and so they remain active in the urine. In fact, it is safer to drink the urine of one who has consumed the mushroom than to eat the mushroom directly, as many of the toxic compounds are processed and eliminated on the first pass through the body. It was common practice among ancient people to recycle the potent effects of the mushroom by drinking each other's urine. The mushroom's ingredients can remain potent even after six passes through the human body. Some scholars argue that this is the origin of the phrase "to get pissed," as this urine-drinking activity preceded alcohol by thousands of years. Reindeer were the sacred animals of these semi-nomadic people, as the reindeer provided food, shelter, clothing and other necessities. Reindeer are also fond of eating the mushroom; they will seek it out, then prance about while under its influence. Often the urine of tripped-out reindeer would be consumed for its psychedelic effects. This effect goes the other way too, as reindeer also enjoy the urine of a human, especially one who has consumed the mushroom. In fact, reindeer will seek out human urine to drink, and some tribesmen carry sealskin containers of their own collected piss, which they use to attract stray reindeer back into the herd. Legend of the flying reindeer and modern image of Santa The effects of the A. muscaria usually include sensations of size distortion and flying. The feeling of flying could account for the legends of flying reindeer and legends of shamanic journeys included stories of winged reindeer, transporting their riders up to the highest branches of the World Tree. Although the modern image of Santa Claus was created at least in part by the advertising department of Coca-Cola, in truth his appearance, clothing, mannerisms and companions all mark him as the reincarnation of these ancient mushroom-gathering shamans.

Description TNG Other caps Comparison TNG to TNG-R Description TNG-R The footage of the USS Enterprise-D approaching Starbase 133 is a re-use of footage of the ship approaching Starbase 74, shot for "11001001". The starbase and planet footage was originally created for "Star Trek III: The Search for Spock", however. "Star Trek III" "11001001" HD The same basic footage was recomposed for TNG-R. The color of the planet was switched to green to mark a difference. The USS Enterprise-D enters the interior of Starbase 133 through large hangar doors. This footage also appeared in "11001001". Like in that episode, the footage of the ship is flipped, as evidenced by the registry on the ventral side of the saucer section. Unsurprisingly, the footage in HD is the same as in TNG-R: "11001001", including the flipped registry. The transporter platform was modified between this episode and "Family" (filmed after "Remember Me", even though it was aired earlier in the season). The platforms are separated by much wider black strips now. "Family" No changes It seems Dr. Dalen Quaice's science division uniform was made from a different fabric than Dr. Crusher's uniform as the fabric has a different shade of blue. We can see a slight difference between the color-corrected shirts in TNG-R as well. Similar cases as the one Dr. Quaice is carrying here have appeared in earlier episodes. "The Bonding" "Ménage à Troi" An HD close-up of the case. This matte painting of the USS Enterprise-D inside a starbase, including the small spacedock craft, also appeared in "11001001". "11001001" HD The matte painting too is the same as in TNG-R: "11001001". The black PADD on the "pool table" is of the same design as several other first season PADDs. In the SD version of the episode, the colors of the PADD seem very washed out. In HD, the true colors of the PADD can be seen. Only one small change made to the engineering set between seasons can be made out in this screenshot: One additional stripe of gray tape was added to the side of the small console in front of the plexiglass window. "The High Ground" This section of engineering as it appears in TNG-R. A first look at Wesley's warp bubble experiment. This is one of the earliest cases in which the unit for subspace distortion, the Cochrane, can be seen on screen. The display in HD.

ABSTRACT Background: Biochemical and behavioral evidence has suggested that the ratio of n-6 (omega-6) to n-3 (omega-3) could be an important predictor of executive function abilities in children. Objective: We determined the relation between the ratio of n-6 to n-3 and cognitive function in children. We hypothesized that children with lower ratios of n-6 to n-3 fatty acids would perform better on tests of planning and working memory. Design: Seventy 7- to 9-y-old children completed three 24-h diet recalls and a subset of the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Assessment Battery. Parents provided information on their demographics and children's diet histories. Results: Mean n-3 and mean n-6 intakes were related to the mean time spent on each action taken in the planning problem. The ratio of n-6 to n-3 significantly predicted performance on the working memory and planning problems. There was a significant interaction between the ratio and fatty acid intake; when children had high ratios, a higher intake of n-3 fatty acids predicted a better performance on the planning task than when children had lower n-3 intakes. When children had low ratios, a lower intake of n-3 and lower intake of n-6 predicted better performance than when intakes were higher. Conclusions: The relation between cognitive abilities and the ratio of n-6 to n-3 may be mediated by an enzymatic affinity for n-3 fatty acids. The ratio of n-6 to n-3 should be considered an important factor in the study of fatty acids and cognitive development. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01823419. INTRODUCTION High omega-6 (n-6) to omega-3 (n-3) fatty acid ratios may be a preventable cause of cognitive and behavioral difficulties in children (1, 2). Fatty acids comprise all neuronal phospholipid membranes (3). Arachidonic acid (AA)4 (20:4n-6) and DHA (22:6n-3) make up 23% of the total lipids in the adult human cortex (4) where they play prominent roles in neurotransmitter metabolism (5, 6), synaptic growth (7), and neuronal communication (7, 8). In animals, AA and DHA are synthesized from their precursors linoleic acid (18:2n-6) and α-linolenic acid (18:3n-3), respectively (9–12). In humans, α-linolenic acid has been shown to convert to EPA, docosapentaenoic acid, and, although still debated, DHA in plasma (13–16; see reference 17 for a counterargument). The rate of conversion is not known in humans but may be quite low in part because of an imbalanced consumption of n-6 and n-3. The ratio of n-6 to n-3 fatty acids is important because the pathways share enzymes such that the ratio of fatty acids consumed may dictate the availability of desaturase and elongase further down the metabolic pathways (seeFigure 1 for an illustration of shared resources). This effect may be detrimental to cognition because the n-3 most prevalent in the brain (ie, DHA) is one of the final steps in the n-3 pathway. Δ-6 Desaturase, which is thought to be the rate-limiting enzyme in this pathway, is required twice in the metabolism of DHA (Figure 1) but could be depleted in the first desaturase step. Thus, endogenous DHA is likely low in individuals who eat high amounts of n-6 and low amounts of n-3 (ie, the typical American diet) (18). FIGURE 1. View largeDownload slide n-6 and n-3 fatty acid metabolic pathways. FADS1, fatty acid desaturase 1; FADS2, fatty acid desaturase 2. FIGURE 1. View largeDownload slide n-6 and n-3 fatty acid metabolic pathways. FADS1, fatty acid desaturase 1; FADS2, fatty acid desaturase 2. Biochemical (19–21) and behavioral (1, 2, 22, 23) evidence has indicated that the balance of n-6 and n-3 may be important for cognition (24). Cognitive abilities known as executive functions develop when children are 3–10 y old (25–27) and are subserved by the temporal and frontal lobes (28–30). During this period of development, cortical gray matter increases rapidly in the frontal areas (31–33). The hippocampus (in the temporal lobes) and prefrontal cortex continue to develop beyond the first 2 y of life (31, 34–36) and have particularly high concentrations of AA and DHA (37, 38). AA (20) and DHA (39, 40) play important roles	1
Arizona Senator Jeff Flake said on Sunday that Republicans who do not call out President Donald Trump for incivility are complicit. "There are times when you have to stand up and say, 'I'm sorry, this is wrong,'" Flake said on CBS' Face the Nation. "There are truths that are self-evident. And you've got to call—whether it's the White House or other elected officials—to task when they're not doing when they should." Flake, a Republican, has been critical of the president, but commended him for the nomination of Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court and his efforts to reform regulations and the tax code.	1
Coastal Carolina won the College World Series in dramatic fashion. The Marlins traded for Fernando Rodney. The Dodgers acquired Bud Norris as Clayton Kershaw went on the DL. The Giants let MadBum hit for himself in an American League park (and he doubled). Our top five: 1. Danny Salazar could start the All-Star Game and he may not be the best starter on the Indians. Here's what Carlos Carrasco did against the Blue Jays as the Indians won their 13th game in a row: 7 IP, 3 H, 1 R, 2 BB, 14 SO. He missed time with a hamstring injury, so he has made just 10 starts this season, but Carrasco is 4-2 with a 2.56 ERA while holding batters to a .225 average. If we go back to July 11 -- yes, cherry-picking that date -- here are the lowest ERAs among AL starters: Danny Salazar: 2.65 Carlos Carrasco: 2.78 Marco Estrada: 2.79 Carrasco, however, has the highest strikeout rate at 29.1 percent, bettered by only five National League pitchers (Jose Fernandez, Stephen Strasburg, Kershaw, Max Scherzer, Noah Syndergaard). Carrasco has allowed a .271 woBA compared to Salazar's .274 (Estrada is at .261). It's close, but you can make an argument that Carrasco is better than Salazar, or at least at the same level. The one knock against him so far is he has allowed 10 home runs in 63⅓ innings, kind of making him the Scherzer of the AL. Anyway, the major point here: Carrasco is good. Salazar is good. Corey Kluber is good. The Indians are good. Carlos Carrasco with a 14 K game. The #Indians starters are pitching like Bob Feller, Bob Lemon, Mike Garcia and Early Wynn. Google it, kids — Jerry Crasnick (@jcrasnick) July 1, 2016 14 Ks, because @Cookie_Carrasco has to stay one step ahead of the streak: https://t.co/IKstfaTnT4‌https://t.co/3zZBhRWTUl — MLB (@MLB) July 1, 2016 2. Give the Nationals credit. In the early season, everyone wanted the Nationals to call up shortstop prospect Trea Turner. Because we love shiny new things! Turner is obviously a legit prospect and he was (and is) hitting well in Triple-A. When Espinosa hit .185 in April and then .208 in May, leaving Turner down looked like a mistake. Maybe the Nationals were just saving on service time, or maybe they were worried Turner was averaging a strikeout a game. Or maybe Dusty Baker just likes veterans. Whatever the reason, they stuck with Espinosa, and he produced a monster June, including homers from both sides of the plate Thursday as part of a seven-RBI night as the Nats crushed the Reds. Espinosa hit .309/.418/.704 in June with nine home runs and 21 RBIs, making him a player of the month candidate. Meanwhile, Turner has played a couple games in center field down at Syracuse ... you know, just in case they want to call him up. Gio on Danny Espinosa: "In Danny we trust. He looks like a stone cold killer up there." — Dan Kolko (@masnKolko) July 1, 2016 3. The most exciting save of the year. Fun game between the Cubs and Mets. The Mets scored three runs in the seventh to take a 4-3 lead -- no idea why the Cubs thought signing Joel Peralta was a good idea -- but Jeurys Familia's streak of 42 consecutive regular-season saves was in jeopardy in the ninth inning after Miguel Montero walked and Ben Zobrist doubled pinch-runner Travis Wood to third base. Familia then struck out Kris Bryant and Willson Contreras (around an intentional walk to Anthony Rizzo) with a bunch of darting, diving, 97-mph sinkers that were moving down and in. Unhittable pitches, although some columnist out there will probably suggest that Bryant is overrated and can't hit good pitching. Anyway, Javier Baez then popped out to first base and the Mets won a big one. Also, Yoenis Cespedes did this, becoming the first player to reach the third deck at Citi Field: Yoenis Céspedes CRUSHED this HR 466 feet, tied for longest HR in Citi Field history.

Reuters/Charles Platiau Senior lobbyists and politicians from Paris, France believe that 10,000 jobs in the financial sector could migrate to the city from London as a result of Brexit, with as many as 30,000 moving if jobs indirectly related to financial services are included in any count. At a press conference in London on Monday, a panel of delegates from Paris — including the City's vice-mayor Jean-Louis Missika, the president of the Paris region, Valerie Pecresse, and Gerard Mestrallet, the chairman of the lobbyist Paris Europlace — addressed the future of the City of London and the movement of jobs to continental Europe after Brexit. "Brexit is a long term process, so the moves will come slowly," Pecresse told reporters. "Tens of thousands I would say," she added, saying that this number related to jobs directly in the financial services sector. Pecresse's thoughts were further clarified by Paris Europlace CEO Arnaud de Bresson, who said: "The number of 10,000 is a good number," citing a survey undertaken by the lobby group. "When we add the number of people who could be concerned in a different industry, then that gives something between 20,000 and 30,000 people, if we add indirect employees," de Bresson continued. Both speakers were keen to add that these numbers are currently just estimates, with Pecresse saying: "It depends on the strategy of the firms and it will depend on how hard Brexit is." Monday's conference was part of a concerted effort by Paris to position itself as the premier EU destination for banks looking to move staff out of Britain after Brexit. Soon after Theresa May delivered a speech signalling that Britain will leave the Single Market, HSBC, JPMorgan, and UBS all warned about job relocations, and there are reports that Goldman Sachs is planning as much behind closed doors. Business Insider's Ben Moshinsky summed up the likely moves in January. They can be seen below:	1
Ten Steps to a Successful Garden Vegetables from the home garden are fresher, may have better nutrient values, and are often less costly than those sold in stores. In addition to providing wholesome, low-cost food, vegetable gardening is an interesting hobby, one in which the whole family can take part. Other advantages of gardening are that it provides healthful outdoor exercise, offers productive activity for retired, handicapped, or disabled persons, and is an excellent teaching tool for children. To get the most out of your garden you should make plans early in the year and follow proper steps during the gardening season. The purpose of this guide is to help you plan and maintain a garden under Illinois growing conditions so that you will have an abundant supply of high-quality vegetables at harvest and (if you freeze, can, or store your vegetables) throughout the year.	1
WARSAW—Like many of his fellow Polish pro-government lawmakers, Dominik Tarczynski is sending a busload of constituents to Warsaw on Thursday to cheer for President Donald Trump. The buses are being provided by a foundation close to the governing party. "It's going to be huge—absolutely huge," Mr. Tarczynski said of the coming welcome for Mr. Trump. "They just love him, the people in Poland—they just really love him." Poland was working to put on a hero's welcome for Mr. Trump, who arrived late Wednesday for a brief visit that includes a speech Thursday in a Warsaw square. President Barack Obamaformed a close bond with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and backed her liberal worldview, her acceptance of immigrants, and her support for a deeply integrated European Union. Now it is nationalist governments such as Poland's that hope Mr. Trump will see them as ideological kindred spirits and back their push to loosen the European Union and rebalance it away from Berlin. "There's this new success—Trump's visit," Jaroslaw Kaczynski, chairman of Poland's ruling Law and Justice party, said at a party congress over the weekend. Tweaking European officials who are nervous that Mr. Trump's visit could deepen the divide on the continent, Mr. Kaczynski went on: "They're envious of it!" Poland, where the conservative Law and Justice government took over in 2015, is locked in an escalating feud with the EU's executive body in Brussels and with Western European capitals. The European Commission has said the government's changes to the Polish judicial system, including appointing its own judges to the Constitutional Court, undermine the rule of law. Advertisement French President Emmanuel Macron suggested Poland was rejecting European democratic principles and treating the bloc like "a supermarket," implying it is taking advantage of the EU without following all of its norms. German politicians often slam Poland for failing to take in refugees and for reducing press freedoms. In Mr. Trump, some Polish politicians and commentators see a leader who has campaigned against accepting refugees and criticized the EU and Germany's influence in the bloc. "Regarding refugees, the Polish government has the same position as Americans—we want strict restrictions on refugees," said Krzysztof Mróz, a Law and Justice lawmaker who plans to dispatch two buses full of Trump fans—98 people—from his district at 2 a.m. on Thursday morning for the 300-mile drive to Warsaw.

Polish Foreign Minister Witold Waszczykowski said in an interview Wednesday with The Wall Street Journal that he told Mr. Trump, on the sidelines of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization summit in Brussels in May: "Please visit us, your soldiers are already here, you can follow, and you can visit a country which is friendly." Advertisement Mr. Trump responded, according to Mr. Waszczykowski, that "Polish Americans helped him win" the presidential election. "I said, 'Well, we can help you once again... if you visit us and cooperate with us,'" Mr. Waszczykowski recalled. But some critics of Poland's government are wary of Mr. Trump's trip. Bartosz Wieliński, foreign editor of the liberal Gazeta Wyborcza newspaper, said the government appeared to be turning Mr. Trump's speech into a "partisan spectacle" and that his public reception would amount to a "Potemkin village." "This visit, I think, is a kind of opportunity for the ruling government party to show that Poland is not completely isolated internationally," said Rafal Pankowski, a Warsaw political scientist.

Jaroslaw Kaczynski, leader of Poland's ruling Law and Justice Party, says, 'There's this new success—Trump's visit.' Photo: kacper pempel/Reuters "It's clear that what the Poles want is to turn their back on France and Germany," a senior EU official said. "Trump is surely not helping." Polish officials say Mr. Trump's visit isn't about deepening the east-west gulf in the EU, but about backing up Poland on issues including countering Russia and on energy security. "I don't think there is a justification to connect the visit of President Trump in Poland to the concept of dividing Europe," Mr. Was	1

The 28-year-old former operator of a French-based torrent site has been ordered to serve a year in jail and pay a five million euro fine. A moderator received a four-month suspended sentence. Somewhat unusually, four regular users of the site were tracked down by their IP addresses. They too received custodial sentences. Whenever anti-piracy groups decide to take action against large file-sharing platforms, they do so on the basis of achieving crushing punishments for their operators. Only severe punishments can stop hardcore pirates, they argue. In France, a similar situation has been playing out. Back in June 2015 following a four-month investigation, people connected to the public torrent site OMGTorrent were arrested and taken into custody. Early claims suggested the site had offered for download more than 10,000 pirated movies. Founded in 2008, the site had built up a solid userbase of around 3.5 million visitors per month. Police insisted it was a for-profit project. "The people behind this platform do not do it for fun, through the platform they earn a lot of money," a police spokesperson said at the time. "Even if they offer movies without requesting compensation, they earn money with various advertisements that appear alongside." Searches of two suspects' homes yielded several computers plus more than 3.5 terabytes of the latest movies. A separate server found overseas contained several thousand more. Police warned that the site's operators could face 10 years in jail plus millions in damages, but they weren't going to stop there. Their investigations had led them to four of the site's top downloaders who they intended to prosecute for receiving stolen goods. After more than a year, six people connected with the site have now been sentenced and it's harsh punishments all round. Following a hearing in March, yesterday the Criminal Court of Chalons-en-Champagne (Marne, France) sentenced the founder of OMGTorrent to one year in prison. The 28-year-old was also ordered to pay a fine of around five million euros for the unauthorized distribution of copyrighted works. Also sentenced was a 38-year-old woman who had worked as a moderator on the site. She was given a four-month suspended sentence and told to pay damages to the plaintiffs in the case. In an unusual turn of events, prosecutors also tracked down four of the site's most heavy downloaders. They too were given prison sentences of one month each and are required to settle with rightsholders. Based on an investigation carried out by ALPA (Association Against Audiovisual Piracy), the prosecution estimated that damages exceed 20 million euros. Following the decision, the site's founder posted an update to the Wareziens forum. "I've been fined a total of 5,000,000 euros for financial damage, 12 months imprisonment and 4 more [months] from a former sentence. My mod has to pay approximately 1,000,000 euros for financial damage," he wrote. "Others, those who have downloaded, I don't know the amount for them, but it far exceeds 500,000 euros. Note: They seized the servers and used them to get the IP addresses of the big downloaders of content." Lashing out at those who hounded him, the admin said the judgment had really hurt. He said he understands why he needed to be punished but for those lower down the chain, the sentences were "beyond comprehension." "To all the [anti-piracy groups and authorities]: You are a lot of vile shit, destroying lives of people who are already struggling to pay their rent, their food, their bills," he said. "Why all this? Because they wanted to watch and because they didn't necessarily have the capabilities to buy a DVD / BluRay or go to the theaters." Listing the country's most popular torrent indexes, trackers and DDL sites, the admin declared that they would never fall. "Warez is a hydra, you cut off one head, 10 will grow back. You'll never kill this beautiful community. It's like drug dealers, it will never stop," he said. Following the raid on OMGTorrent, an unknown third-party managed to secure the domain. The site is now working, as it did before, as a public torrent index.	1

Five pro-Russian rebels were reported killed and four government soldiers injured in the city in Donetsk region. Elsewhere, Ukraine's gas dispute with Russia showed no sign of resolution days before a Russian payment deadline. Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk gave orders to prepare for supplies being cut off from Monday. Russian President Vladimir Putin's spokesman said he had no information about whether negotiations with Kiev could be restarted. Russia has been charging Ukraine $485.50 (£289; 359 euros) per 1,000 cubic metres, the highest tariff in Europe, since relations soured after the downfall of Ukraine's elected pro-Russian President, Viktor Yanukovych, in February. Previously, Ukraine paid a discounted rate of $268 per 1,000 cubic metres. Hundreds of combatants and civilians have been killed since pro-Russian separatists in the Donetsk and neighbouring Luhansk regions declared independence after holding referendums last month, which were deemed illegal by the government in Kiev. The rebellion began after February's ousting of the elected President, Viktor Yanukovych, whose last-minute decision not to sign a landmark treaty with the EU in November sparked mass protests in Kiev.

A man once hailed as "one of the most respected Islamic scholars in the country" was sentenced to death today in an Egyptian court after being found guilty on charges of inciting murder. Dr. Salah Soltan, a senior member of the international Muslim Brotherhood, lived and worked in the U.S. for more than a decade. He is still listed as a member of the Fiqh Council of North America (FCNA) on their organizational brochure. Al-Ahram reports: A Cairo criminal court sentenced Mohamed Badie, the Muslim Brotherhood's supreme guide, and 13 other leading members of the group to death on Monday for inciting murder in the now infamous case known in the media as "Rabaa control room." The 14 convicted include Muslim Brotherhood spokesperson Mahmoud Ghozlan, former Kafr El-Sheikh governor Saad El-Hossainy and preacher Salah Sultan. The court has also set the date of 11 April to announce its verdict concerning other defendants in the case. The court has referred the death sentences to Egypt's Grand Mufti for revision. The referral of the sentences to the Mufti is the first step in the legal process required to enact a death sentence. The Mufti's decision is not binding. However, following his decision the court will issue a final verdict. Once a final verdict is issued, defendants can appeal. Badie and another 13 Brotherhood figures are convicted of setting up an operation after the violent dispersal of the Rabaa Al-Adaweya protest camp in mid-August in 2013 to direct the movements of Brotherhood supporters across the country as part of plans to defy the state and spread chaos, as well as plot attacks on police stations, private property and churches. Soltan was arrested in September 2013 as he tried to flee to Sudan, and was charged with incitement to kill and attempted murder. His son Mohamed, who has become a cause celebre for the American media and U.S. Islamic organizations, was also convicted in the current case and will be sentenced on April 11: Mohamed's father, Salah Soltan, has been sentenced to death.. Mohamed sentence will be on April 11#FreeSoltan #SaveSoltan — #FreeSoltan (@Free_Soltan) March 16, 2015 The story of Salah and Mohamed Soltan will not be unfamiliar to regular PJ Media readers. Just last week, Mohamed Soltan was trying to paint himself in court as an innocent spectator swept up in the aftermath of deposed Egyptian president Mohamed Morsi's overthrow. I noted here that multiple Western media reports at the time identified Mohamed as one of the top leaders organizing the violent Muslim Brotherhood protests in Cairo following Morsi's removal from office. Salah Soltan has also been the subject of several of my reports here at PJ Media going back to January 2009 when he appeared on Al-Nas TV threatening America with death and destruction for its support of Israel. At the same time the elder Soltan was threatening America on Middle East TV, his son Mohamed was seen leading anti-Jewish genocidal chants in front of the Ohio Statehouse (as I reported here last week): Salah Soltan was also a leading figure at the Muslim Brotherhood protests dispersed by Egyptian authorities in August 2013, even appearing on stage at the protest standing beside an al-Qaeda flag: Our late PJ Media colleague Barry Rubin noted here in August 2011 that Soltan had issued a fatwa in Egypt authorizing any Muslim to kill any Israeli that could be found in the country. He also took note of the media backlash I had received for reporting on Soltan's extremist activities and open support for Islamic terrorism. I followed up Barry's report with my own observing everything I had written about Salah Soltan going back to my first report in April 2006. Despite all the attempts by the establishment media to paint him as an interfaith moderate, I chronicled a lengthy list of his activities: A year later, Salah Soltan was a senior member of Morsi's Muslim Brotherhood government in Egypt. As I reported here in August 2012, Soltan could be seen in his new role visiting with a number of U.S.-designated terrorists and Islamic extremists across the Middle East. Those who have followed my reporting here and elsewhere on Salah and Mohamed Soltan know that my continued interest in their activities was not merely academic, as the pair were my former neighbors in my hometown of Hillard, Ohio. The elder Soltan even served as religious director of our local mosque, the Noor Islamic Cultural Center. That story was covered in the 2-part documentary by The Blaze titled The Project. My PJ Media colleague Andrew McCarthy and I were interviewed: When Mohamed Soltan burned down their family home in Hilliard as part of a staged "Islamophobic" hate crime in January 2012, Soltan repeatedly cited in sworn testimony that my writings	1
Mercedes team-mates Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg have made clear that friendship has its limits and theirs is likely to be tested to the full this year as they fight for the Formula One title. The two have been friends and rivals since their early teens, racing go-karts together and following each other through the junior series with both winning the GP2 titles in successive years for the same ART team. Germany's Rosberg made his F1 debut in 2006, Hamilton followed in 2007 and last year they again became team mates when the Briton moved from McLaren, the team with which he won the 2008 championship. Rosberg won this year's season-opener in Australia and leads the championship after two races, 18 points clear of second-placed Hamilton who triumphed last weekend in Malaysia. "At the moment it hasn't changed at all," the son of 1982 world champion Keke Rosberg said at the Bahrain Grand Prix when asked about the dynamics of their relationship at Mercedes. "Maybe because we are not thinking about the championship yet, just race by race really just making the most of what we have, winning races. So early days, maybe," he told reporters. Rosberg recognised that could change as the season progresses, but was not concerned. "We've been in this situation before. In go-karts we were fighting for the championship there, it's exactly the same," he said. "A little bit more people around, more media and spectators but exactly the same in the end. "We managed to get through there with respect and I'm confident we are going to manage again in any circumstance. There will be tough times, inevitably, but I'm confident we can work through it and we will." Very few drivers have real friends on the starting grid, with team mates the ones they want to beat more than anyone since they have the same equipment and provide the clearest yardstick to performance. Some teams have clear hierarchies, such as Ferrari in the Michael Schumacher era or Red Bull where Sebastian Vettel has been champion for the past four years, and any 'team orders' in favour of one driver can trigger resentment and controversy. Mercedes, whose car is clearly a step ahead of the rest at present, are being closely watched for signs of fallout between drivers whose relationship has been hitherto harmonious. Hamilton indicated nobody should be under any illusions about the reality. "It's very simple," he told reporters. "People are constantly talking about us being friends and all that stuff. "Nico and I, as with anyone, can count our friends on one hand. Nico does not come into those five friends I have, and I don't come in the five friends he has. "We're colleagues who have known each other for a long time, longer than any of the other drivers, and we have a great amount of respect for one another. We work in the same team and we have a great working relationship. "We've raced since we were kids, we've been team-mates, been at the front of the championship in the past several times in karting and different championships, and it is no different then as it is now." While both might be steeling themselves for the future, they were also revelling in the transformation of their team from runners-up to front-runners and being a part of that success. "It's great. I've never had that before in F1 and to come to the track where I know I've got the best car and can win the race is a great feeling," said Rosberg. "To be a part of the whole momentum that we have as a team. It's a special moment."

Version 0.21: This article may not be up to date for the latest stable release of Crawl. Magic points or Mana points (usually abbreviated to MP) is the amount of magical energy which a given character has. It is used for spellcasting, for invoking divine powers (with the exception of Trog) and for evoking abilities granted by worn items, mutations, and intrinsic abilities. Having your MP fall to zero is not directly lethal, but can be very hazardous for a spellcaster. MP will regenerate up to your maximum with time, and it is often recommended that spellcasters should rest up to full MP after every fight. Some items like rings of magical power or staves of power can increase a given character's reserves of magical power. Your maximum MP without benefit of items is a function of your experience level, your race, and whichever of your Spellcasting, Evocations, and Invocations skill is higher. Training Spellcasting provides twice as much MP as Invocations or Evocations. Depending on your character, though, this may not be a concern. A typical character starts with 0-7 MP (e.g. 0 for a Minotaur Fighter, 6 for Deep Elf Conjurer, 7 for Deep Elf Wizard) and eventually grows to many times that (30-40 for a level 20 Mummy Necromancer, or 50-60 when using extra items). Strategy MP is a very important stat for spellcasters. Early or mid game rings of magical power are extremely useful, since MP costs are low and your base mana pool is small. However, as your MP hits around the 40+ mark, the efficiency of this stat gets drastically lower. Perhaps the only source of MP that you should use at this point is a staff of magical power, but even that could be replaced by an enhancer staff if you find one appropriate for you.

Species aptitudes used to be multiplicative, but are now additive. Before 0.14, the formula was: Unscaled MP = XL + Permanent MP + (XL*Species modifier + 1)/3 + max(Spellcasting*XL/4, Invocations*XL/6, Evocations*XL/6) where Permanent MP was a constant determined by the player's background and species.	1

It's wrapped in brown packing paper which I prefer to be honest. I'm not an Earth angel, but I still don't like to use plastic if there is an alternative and this definitely goes with the theme of Eco-friendly. Plus, I have enough bubble wrap from other packages to last a lifetime. Literally. The half-life of plastic is over 2,000 years! Inside are my goodies. The pink box is my Green Tea Seed Serum, the cute little brown package is my lovely freebee. I haven't seen the other box as this is my first time buying this, but I WOULD LITERALLY BUY THIS AGAIN JUST TO HAVE THE BOX. So cu-yoot! Bottle photos with manufacturing date. SO fresh. Now, time for the main event! LOOK AT HER! Ain't she a beaut'?! For getting a single item, the whole unboxing experience was very pleasurable. The box was professionally packed which definitely makes me want to reorder from them soon. I'm definitely going to reorder before the promotion is over with. A new color perhaps? I immediately took a shower and tried this stuff. Okay, maybe not immediately. I watched a new episode of Orange Is The New Black. But right after that, I totally took a shower and tried this on. This serum was something my skin needed but I wasn't sure of. Ever since I started using actives, my skin has been a little drier feeling than normal. Not complaining. I have oily skin. But my skin wasn't as soft and supple. Not dewy like it used to be. When I put this on, it felt really great. It absorbed into my skin well and left me feeling like I had finally found that missing piece of the puzzle. The smell was also a plus. It was slightly floral but not strong at all. I hope this doesn't break me out so I can make this a holy grail product. Did we just find our first HG product?! If anyone else has used it, let me know what your experience was like. I'm curious to see what some people's results were like and any reviews on other products in the line. Product junkie OUT!	1
The sun-powered Solar Impulse plane is gradually working up to a trip around the globe, with the most recent benchmark being its first international flight in 2011. Now Bertrand Piccard and Andre Borschberg are taking the jumbo jet-size plane on its first transcontinental journey. The Solar Impulse set off for Morocco today, and its pilots will stop in Madrid along the way. The goal is to complete the 1,554-mile trip by next week, and the big challenge will be crossing cloudy regions like the Pyrenees mountains separating France and Spain. In a 2010 test flight, the Impulse's 12,000 solar cells soaked up enough rays to keep the plane going through the night, but in case something goes wrong this time, the pilots are prepared with parachutes. If all goes well on this trial run, Piccard and Borschberg will be just one step away from their goal of circumnavigating the world in 2014.	1
A generation of middle aged men whose working lives have been book ended by recession are now almost two and half times as likely to commit suicide as the rest of the population, official figures suggest. While the number of people taking their own lives in the UK has fallen significantly in recent years across other age groups, it has surged among men in their 40s and 50s. The same generation – born between the early 1950s and early 1970s – were at the centre of concern about high suicide rates among young men 20 years ago. Experts said that the decline of heavy industry in the 1980s and early 1990s, and major social changes affecting the workplace and family, appeared to have combined to put the generation at particular risk. New figures from the Office for National Statistics show that the total number of men aged between 45 and 59 taking their own lives was almost 40 per cent higher in 2012 than it was less than a decade earlier. Meanwhile the suicide rate among men in that age group is up by more than a quarter over the same period. The age group is now a major focus of effort for charities such as the Samaritans as well as attention by experts attempting to explain the phenomenon. One of Britain's leading authorities on suicide, Prof Rory O'Connor, a Glasgow University psychologist, said there seems to be a clear "generational effect" explaining the previous spike in suicides among young men and now those in middle age. According to the ONS, a total of 5,981 people in the UK took their own lives in 2012, 64 fewer than the previous year. The overall suicide rate has also edged lower to 11.6 per 100,000 people. Three quarters of those who took their own lives in 2012 were men, in keeping with a long-established pattern. Although the figures fluctuate from year to year, there has been a general downward trend in suicide rates since the mid 1990s across generations from teenagers to the elderly, except middle aged men. The rate among men among men in their early 40s currently stands at 25.9 per 100,000 people, almost two and a half times the national level. A quarter of all suicides in Britain involved men aged between 44 and 59, among whom the rate now stands at 23 per 100,000 – 26 per cent higher than it was nine years earlier. The trend is most marked in areas formerly dominated by heavy industry with suicide rates in the North West and North East of England which have the highest levels around 40 per cent higher than in London. Prof O'Connor, who leads the Suicidal Behaviour Research Laboratory at Glasgow University, said there had been a "step change" in suicide patterns in recent years with men in the "prime of life" now the biggest area of concern. "That is a stark change from 20 years ago where the biggest risk were young men," he said. "We think there is a generational effect going on. He said the loss of traditional roles of male breadwinners, particularly in communities once dependent on male dominated industries, appeared to be part of the explanation. But he added that changing habits, including a greater openness among women and younger men to talking about problems and seeking help, had passed many middle aged men by. "Middle aged men are caught between two generations – when you look at their own models, their fathers, it was about not talking about their emotions," he said. "But when you look at their sons, they are much more at ease with talking about their emotions and seeking help. "Society has moved on but middle aged men are not as equipped as they should be with dealing with changes in their role in society." "It is a good thing of course that there is more equality now but arguably in this age group men are not equipped to deal with the change in their social roles." Clare Wyllie, Head of Policy and Research at Samaritans added: "There have been a number of significant changes in society over the last 50 years, including gender roles, families and patterns of social relationships and the decline of traditionally male industries. "Our research shows that disadvantaged men in midlife have seen their jobs, relationships and identity, radically altered. "There is a large gap between the reality of life and the masculine ideal, for this group of men. "They are likely to experience multiple risk factors for suicide which taken together can have devastating consequences." : The Samaritans can be contacted around the clock on 08457 90 90 90.	1

I loved historical fiction when I was younger. I've always read a lot, and I've always read a lot of different books. There are a couple of genres that I've never really been a fan of, but I've always been a non-discriminating reader. However. Historical fiction has always been an absolute favorite of mine. 9 times out of 10 as a kid, my nose was found in an American Girl book or a Dear America book. I hungrily read anything that could transport me to a time and place and situation other than my I loved historical fiction when I was younger. I've always read a lot, and I've always read a lot of different books. There are a couple of genres that I've never really been a fan of, but I've always been a non-discriminating reader. However. Historical fiction has always been an absolute favorite of mine. 9 times out of 10 as a kid, my nose was found in an American Girl book or a Dear America book. I hungrily read anything that could transport me to a time and place and situation other than my own.  Boston Jane was a solid historical fiction read. It was well-done, and obviously well-researched, which is something that is always appreciated, of course. I was transported to early 19th century America as I was reading. Jane is a wonderful character, and a truly enjoyable narrator. She is spunky, spirited, and full of determination, whether it's determination to become a lady, or determination to make the best of her circumstances. She was frustratingly true to her time--from referring to the Indians that she meets as "savages" (at first) to adamantly sticking to Miss Hepplewhite's "rules of being a lady" even when it didn't make sense to act as a lady anymore. She is not a flawless character, but I always like that. I don't always want to read about someone who I like from the get-go. Sometimes, I like to watch a character come into their own as I read, and Jane really does that in this book.  Jennifer L. Holm also wrote a good cast of supporting characters that I know I will look back and fondly remember (even the not-so-nice ones), including Papa, Sally Biddle, Jehu, Mr. Swan, Mr. Russell, Suis, and Handsome Jim. They were all pretty well fleshed out, and even those who didn't necessarily show character development were characters whom I felt like I knew.  Above all, though, this is an adventure story. Jane's adventure story. She sailed to the opposite coast of the United States to start a new life, but even besides that, there was always something going on. I think this is part of what made it such a solid historical fiction read. With every new happening, the reader gets another glimpse of what life would have entailed in the pioneer west of that time.  This was not the best book I've ever read, by any means, but it was a solid good read that kept me up late reading on a couple of occasions. The only thing I am unsure of is how to classify this story. If I had to take a stab, I'd say this is an older MG/younger YA read. There is a 16-year-old narrator and some events that might be considered a bit mature for some audiences, but the writing itself felt like it was geared towards younger readers. I'd recommend this one to maybe older junior high readers looking for a good historical fiction adventure.  On a side note, I did just find out that there are sequels to this. I'm not sure if I will continue with the series, though. I liked Boston Jane so much, so I'm not sure I want to mar my feelings toward it. In other words, I think this installment can definitely stand on its own. I am curious though...	1
As if the X factor wasn't already a stale microwave-meal of a television programme, with its touting of the vulnerable and exposing the worst in the television-watching public, it's managed to spawn an even worse sub-breed of gross.  It seems like Danish X factor judge Thomas Blachman decided there was just too much clothing and not enough objectification in television right now, and thus birthed possibly the most laughably shit and devastatingly backward television show imaginable.  Here's the format:  Blachman and a lucky guest host (not always as contrastive in amount of head-hair as in screenshot) take a seat in their bachelor-boy leather sofa, situated in an ominous warehouse. Woman enters. Woman removes polyester-silk 'robe'.  Hairy and hairless warm up with a quick game of "who can occupy the greatest surface area of man-sofa?" When comfortable, they spout their reactions to the target's body in however way they see fit. Be it commendation, jeering or disgust, it's all okay in the bachelor-pad because, in the words of the creator himself: "The female body thirsts for the words of a man".  Even more ludicrous than the fact it's ACTUALLY allowed to air, is learning that Blachman seems to feels he's doing us a favour. He's having a hard time understanding why we are all being so damn ungrateful for his creation, complaining that such thanklessness is the one thing that stifles this type of televisual ingenuity. And the cherry on this bakewell tart of delusion goes something like this:  'Remember, I am giving you something that you have never seen before. Don't bite the hand that feeds you.'  Sorry Tommy, but when you're force-feeding me juvenile sexism and the most unapologetic type of objectification possible, I'm not going to be in the mood to swallow.  Bite me, Blachman.

Category: Daily Fatwa#: 19580 Asked Country: India Answered Date: Nov 12,2011 Title: Will I be a musafir by travelling to Dehli from Kashmir for less than 15 days? Especially when I have a house and business in Dehli also? Question I belong to a business family in Kashmir. We have our own houses and business in Kashmir as well as dehli. If I am travelling from Kashmir to Dehli for less than 15 days and stay at my place in Dehli, will I be in safar or not? Will I have to perform the sunnah or just fardh? Answer In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. As-salāmu 'alaykum wa-rahmatullāhi wa-barakātuh.  When a person leaves his hometown intending to travel for 48 miles/77 Kilometres then the rules of a musāfir (traveller) will apply. As soon as he exits his city, he will have concession to perform qasr (shortened prayers). If he intends to stay at his destination for less than 15 days, he will continue to shorten his prayers. If he intends to stay for 15 days or more, he will have to perform the normal complete prayer at the destination.[i] If your wife and family live in Kashmir, then Kashmir is your al-watan al-aslī (primary residence). Al-watan al-asli is the hometown where one can never be a musāfir unless he migrates from there with all his belongings and family. Whenever a person enters al-watan al-aslī, he will no longer be deemed a musāfir (traveller). Dehli is regarded as your al-watan al-iqāmah (temporary residence). According to a number of scholars, if a person has a home and belongings at one place which he visits regularly and has stayed there once for at least for 15 days, then this abode will be regarded as al-watan al-iqāmah. If the person travels away from this location, this city will still remain his al-watan al-iqāmah. This means that whenever he visits this place, even if he is there less than 15 days, he will not be a musāfir whilst he is there.[ii] Since you will not be a musāfir in Dehli, you will complete your fardh and sunnah prayers as normal.[iii]  And Allah Ta'āla Knows Best Mawlana Faraz Ibn Adam, Student Darul Iftaa UK Checked and Approved by, Mufti Husain Kadodia. www.daruliftaa.net	1
San Antonio Mayor Ivy Taylor discussed systemic poverty at a forum April 3. (NOWCastSA) A few weeks ago, the World Bank updated its analysis of Global Extreme Poverty, dozens of chapters dedicated to exploring, in minute detail, the many complex and intersecting reasons as to why people are poor. About the same time, San Antonio Mayor Ivy Taylor was asked a similar question about the root causes of poverty in her city. She offered a simple rationale: Broken people. Particularly broken people who don't have a strong relationship with God. The statement has incensed newly minted critics of Taylor days before the city's mayoral election. They claim it was an insensitive one-two punch of blaming poverty on the poor and asserting that nonreligious people are at the root of society's ills. On April 3, Taylor (D) and fellow candidate, San Antonio councilman Ron Nirenberg, were at a mayoral forum and took a question from the director of San Antonio's Christian Resource Center, according to the San Antonio Current: "What do you see as the deepest, systemic causes of generational poverty in San Antonio?" In the video, Taylor makes a joke about the hefty nature of the question, asks the questioner to repeat it, then says, "I'll go ahead and put it out there": To me, it's broken people. People not being in relationships with their creator and therefore not being in good relationship with their families and their communities and not being productive members of society. So I mean, I think that's the ultimate answer. Annie Laurie Gaylor, one of the co-presidents of the Freedom From Religion Foundation, said her organization was prompted to send a letter to Taylor defending people who are not religious. "As mayor, you represent a diverse population that consists of not only Christians, but also atheists, agnostics, Jews, Muslims, and Hindus," the letter said. " … Nationally, about 35 percent of millennials are nonreligious. Imagine for a moment a mayoral candidate making such undeserved and broad accusations against Jews or Muslims instead of nonbelievers. The outcry would properly be swift and severe. It should be no different for nonbelievers." Mayor Ivy Taylor (Photo courtesy of Ivy Taylor) Gaylor told The Washington Post she feared the mayor's words would send a message to other political leaders that it's okay for religiosity to guide politics. "As mayor, she has a bully pulpit, but it shouldn't be an actual pulpit," Gaylor said. "It implies the root of all bad things is Godlessness. … San Antonio is not a congregation. She's not a pastor. She's a mayor. We do hope that she'll realize not just what's offensive about it, but that it is so wrong." Taylor posted a lengthy statement on her Facebook page, claiming the video clip that surfaced had been selectively edited to misrepresent her views. In particular, she said she doesn't believe that just poor people are "broken." [This mayor won't stop posting racist Obama memes. He won't resign, either.] "I also believe in Original Sin, and that was the context for my comment in the YouTube video clip. We're all 'broken,' from the richest among us to the poorest, until we forge a relationship with our Maker. I could have expressed myself more clearly in explaining my belief at the forum." In an interview, Taylor told The Post she believes society would be better if people had a stronger relationship with God. But she said she has tried to stress to voters that San Antonio is not a theocracy, and she doesn't believe leaders should govern from the Bible. "I don't know if anyone took the time to really understand what I was trying to convey. And if I wasn't effective in communicating that, then I certainly wish I could have been clearer," she said. "The history of our urban areas is that a lot of the policies that have been developed on the federal and local levels have led to the creation of islands of poverty," she said. "I've spent my career on efforts trying to level the playing field." But as the mayor has tried to explain her thinking, Gaylor said her group felt that she was just affirming the statement about religion and government that they had the biggest problem with. "There had been a Facebook statement, and it's kind of a non-apology apology," Gaylor said. "This just isn't good enough." "It's a stereotype that she's perpetuating," Gaylor continued. "We're not criticizing her record combating poverty … we're blaming her for blaming nontheism or non-Godliness for poverty." On the phone with Trey Ware of KTSA 550am.

The proposed Europa Clipper mission would go into orbit around Jupiter, instead of Europa itself, making several dozen close flybys of the icy moon. At an estimated cost of $2.1 billion, it is less than half the cost of previous Europa orbiter concepts, but NASA is looking for ways to further reduce costs. (credit: NASA/JPL) Europa on the cheap For decades, scientists have dreamed of sending a mission to Europa, one of Jupiter's four large Galilean moons. The fleeting flybys of the moon by Voyagers 1 and 2 in 1979, and the more frequent flybys by Galileo in the 1990s, revealed a world with a icy crust, crisscrossed by fractures and other complex features. Those and other observations led scientists to conclude that Europa has, below that icy crust, a subterranean ocean of liquid water that, combined with the energy from tidal heating that keeps that ocean liquid and organic compounds, provide the basic requirements for life. Instead of going into orbit around Europa, the Europa Clipper spacecraft would instead go into orbit around Jupiter and make repeated close flybys of the moon. As compelling as the scientific case is for Europa, NASA has yet to send a dedicated mission there. Part of that is due to the technical challenges involved in launching a spacecraft to Jupiter and operating in the high radiation environment created by Jupiter's powerful magnetic field. Those technical obstacles drive up the costs of those proposed missions, and reduce the chances they can be funded. NASA has studied Europa orbiter mission proposals since the late 1990s, but those efforts typically foundered on costs and shifting priorities. In 2011, the latest planetary science decadal survey—the once-per-decade report outlining priorities for planetary science missions based on science and other factors—identified a Europa orbiter as the second-highest priority large, or "flagship" mission, behind a rover to collects samples on Mars for later return to Earth. That ranking, though, came with a caveat: an independent study of the mission concluded it would cost $4.7 billion, too high a price tag. For a Europa mission to remain highly ranked, NASA needed to bring down the cost significantly. (See "Tough decisions ahead for planetary exploration", The Space Review, April 4, 2011). NASA has been working on reducing a cost of a Europa orbiter mission, in large part by no longer making it an orbiter. The concept now favored within the space agency is something called "Europa Clipper." Instead of going into orbit around Europa, the spacecraft would instead go into orbit around Jupiter and make repeated close flybys of the moon. The most recent mission designs involve 45 flybys of Europa over three and a half years, with the vast majority of them coming within 100 kilometers of the moon's surface. That approach minimizes the spacecraft's exposure to radiation as well as propellant needed for entering orbit around Europa. Europa Clipper is still in its earliest phases, with a mission concept review planned for September. A notional design for the mission, presented at a meeting of NASA's Outer Planets Assessment Group (OPAG) in January, showed a spacecraft equipped with nine instruments, including cameras, spectrometers, and an ice-penetrating radar, whose booms extended from either side of the spacecraft's bus like parts of an old-fashioned television antenna. Launched on an Atlas V 551 in November 2021, the spacecraft would arrive at Jupiter in April 2028 after gravity assist flybys of Venus and the Earth. That design has a cost estimate of about $2.1 billion, less than half the independent cost estimate for the earlier Europa orbiter mission in the decadal survey report. That work on Europa Clipper has largely been done at the insistence of Congress, rather than by NASA's own initiative. In the final fiscal year 2013 budget, Congress set aside $75 million of NASA's planetary sciences budget specifically for Europa mission studies, and followed that up with $80 million in the fiscal year 2014 budget, even though NASA requested no money in either year's budget request for Europa. The text of the final 2014 appropriations bill noted that the $80 million "shall be for pre-formulation and/or formulation activities for a mission that meets the science goals outlined for the Jupiter Europa mission in the most recent planetary science decadal survey." When NASA released its fiscal year 2015 budget proposal last month, it contained, for the first time, a line item for Europa mission studies. NASA requested $15 million for fiscal year 2015, but was short on details in the document on how the money would be used. "Following the analysis of options for a lower-cost Europa mission conducted in FY 2014, NASA will continue developing the architecture for a potential Europa mission," the budget justification document stated. "My desire, to be quite honest, would be to target a Europa mission that we could fly for a billion dollars or less," Bolden said. At the formal rollout of the budget March 4, NASA administrator Charles Bolden and chief financial officer Beth Robinson were	1
by Mary Mann "In the seventies men didn't want women in the dojo," Denise Williams told me. "Susan, my teacher, she was thrown out because she wanted to do knuckle pushups. They said, "You'll get calluses on your knuckles and nobody will want to marry you.'" She paused, then added: "People really did talk like that back then." Denise is a small woman in her sixties. She wears big glasses and smiles a lot and practices massage therapy. She's also a karate black belt, and has been head sensei of the Women's Center Karate Club since the eighties, but no more: this fall, shortly after the death of its founder Susan Ribner — who also helped found the National Women's Martial Arts Federation — Denise closed New York City's last women-only karate school. Women-only karate classes seem, in retrospect, like the perfect apotheosis of 1970s New York. It was one of the city's most violent eras, with approximately 2,000 murders and 5,000 reported rapes per year, not to mention an average of 250 subway felonies each week — the 4 train was known as the Mugger's Express. It was also the heyday of second-wave feminism: Gloria Steinem founded Ms. Magazine, the Black Women's Manifesto was published, the ERA went to Congress and Take Back the Night events began. Feminists everywhere wanted change, and while sometimes the issues one group represented clashed with those of another, one thing women seemed to agree on was the nobody felt all that safe. From this fertile ground three women-only karate schools sprang up, simultaneously and independently, within a couple miles of each other. Brooklyn Women's Martial Arts held classes in apartments and at street fairs. The Karate School for Women had a storefront in the West Village. The Women's Center Karate Club operated from the locker-lined bunkroom of a decommissioned firehouse in the West 20s, which they eventually lost due to rising rents — for most of its existence the club operated out of rooms rented by the hour. Though this was the era of consciousness-raising — women gathering to share stories for solidarity — karate was separate from that. Instead they learned chops and kicks and blocks and a confident way of being in the world, best summarized to me by Denise's description of kiai: staring stare someone down while shouting. "I used to be so shy," she says. "But now, if I look you in the eyes I can just about cut you." Class material was the same as in male-dominated karate dojos — the difference wasn't the what but the how. In your typical karate class you begin by tearing the ego down, but in women-only classes you build the ego up — not in a "you look great" or "reach for the stars" kind of way, but something more like "yes, your instincts are absolutely right, that guy is bad news." Many of the women, Denise suggested, had been through some sort of trauma, and women's karate was about trusting your gut and taking action, a pretty novel lesson in an era when marital rape was legal and women were subject to their husbands' whims via "head and master" laws. From subway platforms to family rooms, trusting your gut is good advice that's hard to take when you've been raised with June Cleaver as ideal woman. Though they'd all bloomed so suddenly together, the city's women-only karate schools faded away slowly and separately. The Karate School for Women was the first to go: owner Roberta Schine, among whose students was Weather Underground leader Kathy Boudin, closed up shop in 1995 to become a yoga teacher. Also in the nineties, Brooklyn Women's Martial Arts morphed into something else entirely: The Center for Anti-violence Education. Almost twenty years later, in October 2014, the Women's Center Karate Club finally closed its doors. Why did women-only karate fade away? Maybe women just felt safer, and certainly they had less time, as they were increasingly able to land a variety of jobs but still shouldered most of the household chores. I suspect the waning popularity of karate itself also has had something to do with it. American karate peaked in the eighties, but the glory days of Miyagi coaching Daniel-san in Karate Kid are long over, and strip mall karate now seems shabby next to newer imports: krav maga, muay thai and Brazilian juijitsu, plus the flashy, fast-paced combo of them all — mixed martial arts. Women still practice karate, and they're allowed in dojos now, but most dojos remain 90% male. This sounds intimidating to me, but for a lot of women it isn't a problem: 31-year-	1
We're now a few weeks removed from Mariano Rivera's final game at Yankee Stadium, which means most sports fans who watched it have had enough time to stop crying while awkwardly insisting that they're not crying. As a hockey fan, I watched Rivera's exit while thinking How can I take that wonderful baseball moment and translate it into a hockey post? And that's how I came up with the idea of listing 10 legendary NHL players who, like Rivera, played their entire career with one team. And then I thought How can I take this idea for a feel-good walk through the pages of hockey history and turn it into an excuse for people to yell at each other? And that's when I decided that instead of just listing 10 guys, I'd also rank them. So here we go: the 10 best players in NHL history, in order, among those who spent their entire career with one franchise. 10. Denis Potvin, New York Islanders (1973-1988) Potvin won three Norris Trophies and four Stanley Cups during a 15-year career in which he established himself as one of the most respected Hold on, I need to pause for a minute while all the Ranger fans chant "Potvin Sucks" for a while. Still waiting. Still waiting OK, you know what, there are only so many hours in the day so let's just agree that Potvin was one of the most-respected players in the league as long as you weren't in Madison Square Garden. He captained the Islanders' early '80s dynasty that captured four straight championships and won 19 consecutive postseason series, a record that likely stands as completely unbreakable in the salary-cap era. He averaged just less than a point per game over his career, and retired as the league's all-time leading scorer among defensemen. As for you still-chanting Rangers fans, here's a fun fact: Potvin claimed that Mike Keenan asked him to make a comeback and join the 1993-94 Rangers team that eventually won the Stanley Cup. Potvin, who by then was 41 years old and had been out of hockey for six years, considered the offer but eventually declined. 9. Stan Mikita, Chicago Blackhawks (1958-1980) Mikita was a gifted scorer who combined with Bobby Hull to give the Blackhawks the most feared offensive duo of the 1960s. He led the league in points four times in a five-year stretch, won two MVPs, and helped the Blackhawks win a Stanley Cup in 1961 that would be the franchise's last for 49 years. But beyond the stats, Mikita had a fascinating career. He was one of the first European-born players to star in the NHL. He was among the first of what we now consider the prototypical two-way center, dominating at both ends of the ice and becoming an excellent faceoff man. He and Hull helped pioneered the use of curved blades. Over the years he transformed from one of the league's most penalized players to an eventual Lady Byng winner. And he even designed and marketed his own style of helmet. A horrible, ugly helmet. 8. Mike Bossy, New York Islanders (1977-1987) Quick: Who's the NHL's all-time leader in goals per game? OK, it's obviously Mike Bossy since the question is appearing in his section. But if it weren't for that giveaway, wouldn't you have guessed someone like Mario Lemieux or Pavel Bure or Brett Hull first? It shouldn't be possible to own the record for most consecutive 50-goal seasons and still be criminally underrated, but Bossy comes close to pulling it off. This is because of injury problems that cut his career short. Bossy had only turned 30 during the 1986-87 season, but his back was already a mess. He took the next season off in hopes of mounting a comeback, but it wasn't to be, and he retired after playing just 10 seasons. Even by the insane standards of the 1980s, Bossy's numbers were eye-popping. Nine consecutive 50-goal seasons. Five 60-goal years. A 50-in-50 season in 1981. A career shooting percentage of 21.2 percent. In what's becoming a bit of a running theme among players on this list, Bossy almost didn't qualify. While pondering a comeback, he was rumored to be offered to his hometown Canadiens (who had famously passed on him in the 1977 draft, taking Mark Napier instead). But the deal never happened, and Bossy officially retired in the summer of 1988. 7. Joe Sakic, Quebec Nordiques/Colorado Avalanche (1988-2009) Sakic counts, right? We said we were ranking guys who played for one franchise, so we can't use the fact that the Nordiques became the Avalanche against him. He	1

The Polish central bank has announced that it is to introduce a 500 zloty bank note. The note according to the central bank, will be introduced within the next two years. The bank's head, Marek Belka, has said that the face of the 500 zloty bill will be King Jan III Sobieksi, one of the most notable monarchs of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. He died in 1696. Presently, the largest note in circulation in Poland is the 200 zloty note, which is the equivalent of €48. The euro equivalent of the 500 zloty note will be 120. The reason presented for the new larger denomination according to the central bank, revolved around the need to lower the cost of maintaining bank reserves. 200 Alterations Belka also unveiled a new 200 zloty note to be introduced in February of next year. The alterations on the 200 zloty banknote will be only minor, such as changing the shade among other touch ups.	1

Scurvy Scurvy (severe vitamin C deficiency) is rare as most people get enough vitamin C in their diet. It's usually easy to treat. Causes of scurvy Scurvy is caused by not having enough vitamin C in your diet for at least 3 months. Vitamin C is mainly found in fruit and vegetables. Even people who don't eat very healthily all the time aren't usually considered at risk of scurvy. Things that increase your risk of scurvy Although scurvy is rare, you may be more at risk if you: are on an unusual or restrictive "fad" diet – with very few or no sources of vitamin C – with very few or no sources of vitamin C eat very little food at all – possible reasons include treatments that make you feel very sick all the time (such as chemotherapy) or an eating disorder such as anorexia – possible reasons include treatments that make you feel very sick all the time (such as chemotherapy) or an eating disorder such as anorexia have a poor diet and smoke – smoking reduces how much vitamin C your body absorbs from food – smoking reduces how much vitamin C your body absorbs from food have a poor diet and are pregnant or breastfeeding – your body needs more vitamin C at these times Important Speak to your GP or midwife before taking any supplements or making changes to your diet during pregnancy. Other groups who may be more at risk of scurvy include: people with a severe digestive condition, such as Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis babies and young children who aren't getting the recommended amount of vitamins – read about vitamins for children very elderly people, who may find it harder to cook or maintain a healthy diet people addicted to drugs or alcohol See a GP if you're at risk of scurvy and you: feel very tired and weak all the time feel irritable and sad all the time have severe joint or leg pain have swollen, bleeding gums – sometimes teeth can fall out develop red or blue spots on the skin, usually on your shins have skin that bruises easily These might be symptoms of scurvy. Treating scurvy Scurvy is easily treated by adding some vitamin C to your diet, such as fresh fruit and vegetables. Your GP may also recommend taking vitamin C supplements until you feel better. They might arrange a blood test to confirm you have scurvy if they're not sure. Most people treated for scurvy feel better within 48 hours and make a full recovery within 2 weeks. Your GP may refer you to a specialist for treatment, support or advice. This depends on what's causing your scurvy.	1
ONE difficulty of reporting on spy outfits like America's National Security Agency is the veil of secrecy they operate behind. This makes it hard to know exactly what they are and aren't capable of. It is also one reason why Edward Snowden's revelations have been so fascinating. They offer a glimpse—limited and incomplete, to be sure—behind the curtain, and help to constrain the bounds of just what such agencies can do. Take a recent post on Wired's security blog. It discusses the latest Snowden leak, which details the size of America's secret-intelligence budget. In particular, Wired picks up on James Clapper, the Director of National Intelligence, talking about investing in "groundbreaking cryptanalytic capabilities to defeat adversarial cryptography and exploit internet traffic". And it links to another post in which James Bamford, a veteran chronicler of the NSA, describes the agency as having made "an enormous breakthrough several years ago in its ability to cryptanalyze, or break, unfathomably complex encryption systems employed by not only governments around the world but also many average computer users". That sounds a lot like saying that the the spooks have managed to break at least some of the cryptographic codes that protect everything from secure e-mail to e-commerce. Get our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.  If true, it would be a very big story indeed. Such codes are ubiquitous because they are widely thought to be secure. If such a breakthrough has indeed happened (and Mr Snowden, for one, has said that it hasn't) what would it look like? Not being privy to the NSA's deepest secrets, Babbage has no idea. But he can speculate. The most likely (and least interesting) answer is that the NSA has found a bug in the way that specific programs implement cryptographic protocols. Such flaws are fairly common, and can usually be fixed simply by patching the software. (Though that relies on people finding the flaws and then sharing that information widely, which NSA would be unlikely to do.) However, Mr Clapper's and Mr Bamford's use of "groundbreaking" and "breakthrough" to describe the NSA's advances could be read as suggesting that something more fundamental could be at hand—perhaps even a flaw in the mathematics that underpin cryptography. Electronic cryptography relies on the curious fact that some mathematical operations are easy to do in one direction but virtually impossible to perform in reverse. For example, multiplying two enormous prime numbers together to get a third colossal number is easy. But, analysing a colossal number produced in this way and trying to determine its prime factors is colossally difficult. So difficult, in fact, that it stumps even the world's snappiest supercomputers. This bit of mathematics—integer factorisation in the argot—forms the foundation of most of the internet's cryptographic systems (codes based on other kinds of mathematical operation exist, but they aren't as commonly used). Researchers already know that it is possible, in theory, to break such encryption by building a quantum computer, an unusual machine that relies on various kinds of quantum weirdness to perform its calculations. A mathematician called Peter Shor proved in 1993 that such a computer could be used to speed up integer factorisation drastically, to the point where much of the internet's existing security infrastructure would be useless. Does the NSA have a quantum computer in the basement of its headquarters in Maryland (pictured above)? It is theoretically possible, but pretty unlikely. For building a working quantum computer is itself terribly tricky. University laboratories have been trying for years, but the technology is finicky and progress has been slow. The record for prime factorisation using Shor's algorithm currently stands at the number "21", which was split into its prime factors (7 and 3) in 2012. A Canadian firm called D-Wave is presently selling a specialised kind of quantum computer—Lockheed Martin, an American defence giant, and Google have each bought one—but it is not suitable for this kind of work. And contrary to spy thrillers and conspiracy theories, it is far from obvious that a government agency could be so much more advanced than the academic cutting-edge, especially in a hardware and technology-heavy field like quantum computing. There is another option, though. Mathematicians are much easier to get hold of than quantum computers, and do not require any fancy technology to work (a computer, a stack of paper and a bin will suffice). Signals-intelligence agencies employ them by the hundreds. And although it is difficult at present to find the prime factors of big numbers, no one has actually formally proved that it has to be so. In other words, no one knows whether the present state of the art is the fastest way to do things. Quicker ways may well exist. Indeed, earlier in the year, there was some excitement in cryptographic circles when a pair of new papers reported the first significant progress in years in something called the "discrete log	1
Alright Personal answer as many do not seem to know too much about Syria, myself included, this may be a bit long For reference in this answer: The current Syrian Constitution To start we need some history Syria was under French mandate from 1922-1944 effectively giving them control over Syria. After the French had withdrawn, Syria has been in a constant state of civil war with one coup after another with factions constantly fighting, some even sponsored by the US. The regimes went through many different periods of dictatorship and democracy's constantly being replaced. It was not until 1963 when The Arab Socialist Resurrection (Baath) Party (hereafter, Baath Party), with a secular, socialist, Arab nationalist orientation, took decisive control in a March 1963 coup. The Baath Party was active in throughout the middle East since the 1940's. In 1970 a revolt occurred after many military failures a bloodless coup occurred and Hafez al-Assad, former Defense Lieutenant General, won the popular referendum and became president for the next 30 years. In 1973 a constitution was established defining the roles of parliament, the president and vice president, the cabinet of ministers, and the people. It began by declaring Syria under a single party system that party being the Baath party, Islamic Jurisprudence was also established based on Shia law, the president is also required to be a follower of Islam. However, it also allowed for freedom of religion so long as public order is not threatened, this would later be used primarily on Sunni Arabs and Jews in Syria. There was a large focus on education and jobs as a right of the people for the government to uphold. During the next 30 years Hafez's regime would be labeled authoritarian as a State of Emergency was declared allowing for suppression of citizens. Notably the Muslim Brotherhood who rose up declaring the regime too secular, I honestly didn't think I'd be typing that. Many reports of people disappearing or being assassinated. The economy also did poorly during much of this time according to the source in the header. In 2000 Hafez died. Parliament amended the constitution lowering the age for the presidency from 40 to 34 allowing Bashar Assad, Hafezs son, to run. Parliament did not elect any opposition to run against Assad. Assad was met with pushback. A few years later Assad began reforming by enforcing/enacting mandatory retirement and replacing certain high-level administrators with appointments from outside the Baath Party. This effectively kicked many of the old out of the government who opposed his rule. In 2011 many rebellion groups began to pop up and a few years later a civil war broke out. In 2012 the Syrian Constitution was amended again transforming Syria into a multi-party democracy like much of the West. Is Syria a Dictatorship - Section based off of The current Syrian Constitution It can be for 3 months. Syria follows a parliamentary system. In this system The Citizens of Syria elect members of parliament who then proceed to nominate one or more candidates for the presidency. The president then appoints a cabinet who have to be confirmed by parliament, the same way in the US. The president more or less has power over most things aside from the law, which he is tasked to enforce. When parliament is out of session the president gains power over the law, however when parliament is back in session their first order of business is to scrutinize any laws made with the ability to throw them out in their entirety. The president can also abolish parliament for up to 3 months, however a reason is needed and parliament can never be abolished twice for the same reason. The president also has veto power, when parliament passes a bill the president can veto it, in which case it goes back to parliament where if it passes again with a super majority it will become law. So in short, kind of. The president can gain absolute power at times and the system is flimsy without much oversight that I could find of the president itself. I'll put it this way if the US is a Demo-Republic then Syria is an Oligarch-Democracy. Also worth noting in the 2012 referendum the presidency was limited to two 7 year terms. Meaning that if they wish to prove any semblance of non-dictatorial rule that this should legally be Assads last term ending in 2021. One more thing, a state of emergency had been in place for over 30 years allowing governments to seize those that speak out openly against the government. Assad lifted this state of emergency in hopes of avoiding a civil war. Personal Thoughts The Syrian regime, under the founding Baath party, seemed to show a great deal of French influence with their political breakdown/separation of power, religious liberty, and the government giving to the people. These were not commonly found during that period with many still being under Shariah or totalitarian regimes. Not to say this is not a totalitarian regime. Syria had been in a State of Emergency for over 30 years now	1
The issue of weather modification - or 'environmental modification' (ENMOD) - has been coming back to my attention recently. In the past I have discussed the usually theories around HAARP etc, and even touched on chemtrails, yet with so much talk on global climate change and carbon emissions, with little or no mention of geo-engineering of climate, I again wonder... In the intervening years I have taken a consideration that the sun - our Solar Ra - has much to do with earth changes in our solar vicinity as well as on Earth, and have been looking into solar flares. No doubt more on this later. First, just a teaser - I came across this intriguing reference to the St. Louis Arch, a 636 ft. monument on the west bank of the Mississippi River, which has stood for nearly forty years. This short article titled ' Can We Control the Weather? ' says that It is a shining monument built to convey St. Louis's role as the Gateway to the West. Only now has the reason for its construction as well as its true purpose been revealed. It seems that some of the same scientists responsible for the doomsday weapon research in the deserts of the Southwest U.S. during the forties, were also interested in controlling the weather. They hoped to use weather control as a means to aid in troop movement and logistics for the Allies, as well as use it as a tactical weapon against the enemy. This, they hoped, would bring about a quick end to the war in Europe. Thus, the design for the arch was conceived. The stainless steel structure, while able to produce an ionic pulse, is impervious to any lingering affects. Each leg of the arch is able to push positive and negative ions into the air so as to create a positive or negatively charged field that can 'push' storms out of the way. During the day this national monument stands as the gateway to the west, but after hours this man-made marvel turns into one of the most powerful weather controlling devices ever conceived. It makes us wonder about some of the other modern architectural feats being erected around the world... -	1
The Devil's Evolution Catalog Chapter 45: The Arrogance of a Demon Child As the two spiked maces hurtled towards him, he jumped backwards, perfectly dodging them. With a quick kick of his two feet, he sprinted towards No.3 and Big 4. Before the pair could even recover from their missed swings, Chipped Horn was already within striking distance of No.3. With a forceful clench of his fist, the incandescent flames wrapped around his fists once more. *Bam* Before No.3 could even react, the flaming fist slammed into his chest and sent his entire body careening through the air. Next to him, Big 4 was able to recover his stance with the time bought by No.3. As No.3 was sent flying, he counter attacked with his spiked mace. However, this attack was immediately stopped by the steel-like palms of the Demon Child, who with a clench of his fist, immediately took control of the incoming mace. With a violent tug, the mace left the hands of Big 4 and was immediately tossed away by Chipped Horn. With a fiery punch to his body, Big 4 was sent flying as well, his injuries just as severe as No.3. The pair would probably be unable to get up for a while. In the short span of time it took for him to defeat No.3 and Big 4, I wasn't idling about either. As the familiar flames extended from my hands, I prepared my sneak attack. Flame Whip! The snake-like whip coiled around the left leg of Chipped Horn without much trouble. As the flames crackled, my heart fell. His leg was unharmed. "It's useless. Flames cannot harm me." With a light kick of his foot, the flames binding it dispersed harmlessly into the air. I was aware of his flame resistance, but this was the only option I had.  The darkness arrows were simply too weak. It was still effective against large imps, but against head imps, its effects were significantly weaker. The enemy in front was even stronger than a head imp, so casting them was merely a waste of mana. My nether flames were still sealed up, so I couldn't use them. As for the bone wall...he was already able to break through them when he was a head imp. That means only my flame whip had any chance of working. No matter how slim those chances were, I still wanted to take the gamble. Unfortunately, that gamble failed miserably. As expected, he was immune to my flames. "Err...let's sit down and talk, there's no need for all this violence." "I want you!" Chipped Horn wasn't in the mood to waste anymore time. He glared at me for a moment before instantly pouncing towards me. Damn it, don't just jump straight into action after saying so! Bone Wall! In this crucial moment, I ended up relying on my bone wall after all. Even though I knew it was useless, I still struggled. The creamy white wall immediately rose up from the ground, blocking the path between me and Chipped Horn. He wasn't able to react to the sudden obstacle in front of him and rammed headlong into it. *crash* The tank-like demon child rammed right through the bones as if they were merely paper. With that, the bone wall crumbled into a pile of broken shards. This was soon followed by the sound of a second bone wall being destroyed, and then a third...However, at this moment my eyes flickered to his feet, and a bone wall instantly rose at the point where his foot was about to land. My plan was to trip him with my bone wall as he landed. The unexpected landfall would cause him to lose his balance and fall. Unfortunately for me, having evolved into a demon child, Chipped Horn seemed to have gained inhuman reflexes as well. The moment he noticed the bone wall, he shifted his weight towards the front, regaining his balance. With a light kick of his feet, he made a tiny leap off the rising wall, as if it were stepping stone. While he wasted time on this tiny wall, I prepared a 4th bone wall in his path. If everything went according to plan, he wouldn't be able to change his course midair and would crash right into that wall. However, tactics were meaningless in front of such immense strength. Even with my mana strengthening this wall, the outcome was still as bleak as the other three. While he wasn't able to change course as expected, he instead clasped his hands together and raised them up high. His muscles bulged as he brought them down onto the wall	1
Source: mydaily, translated by @Spica_Tweets  I'm so mad that she had to wake up to this bullshit.. and wtf is B2M thinking? they need to protect their artists more and sue that news outlet for using her photo and damaging her rep like this. (will update with B2M's statement when they post it sometime in this millennium.) We have confirmed with Yang Jiwon and the other members. It is definitely not any one of them. People may misidentify the female as Jiwon when watching the video, but it is definitely not her. We were also left feeling speechless when the news was reported with Yang Jiwon's blurred photo. It's a horrifying world recently; people fail to distinguish right from wrong. However, we still have no specific plans of taking any legal action. Jiwon's tweet: http://www.twitlonger.com/show/n_1slb3rf Yesterday I was riding my bike and was eating something, then I got a call from the company. There was a 5-car pileup accident and it seemed like the passenger was me so they were going to release an article saying it's me. I was taken aback by the fact that they were going to release an article based on a video that could not confirm I was the passenger. Because it's not good news, fans would worry ㅜㅜBecause it wasn't confirmed that I was the passenger, my name would not go out in articles and the conversation finished there. I watched a friend's performance, went out to eat and went home.But early in the morning I got texts from people and when I confirmed with articles, my picture was used with a mosaic in an article about a drunk driver's passenger.. A fuzzy picture saying 'girl group member with initial J'..ㅜㅜ The company said they'll take action if an exact name is mentioned directly but fans keep worrying and they're probably frustrated so I'm writing a post before that happens!To the people involved in the accident, I hope your injuries aren't too severe.. It's early in the morning, everyone have a nice Sunday.. ^^	1
Four people were shot early Thursday in a home invasion in DeKalb County, police said. The shooting happened about 2 a.m. at a townhouse at the Terraces on Terrace Trail, which is off Snapfinger Woods Drive. "Five armed gunmen entered the location brandishing firearms, " DeKalb police Lt. Rod Bryant said. Two of them were shot. Two people who live at the townhome were wounded during the shooting, too. Another resident was injured after jumping through a window. All were taken to a local hospital. Of the four people shot, one was in serious condition, Bryant said. A 13-year-old child inside the home at the time of the shooting was not injured, Channel 2 Action News reported. The whereabouts of the others who allegedly forced their way inside the townhome were unknown. "The investigation is ongoing and this appears to be drug-related," DeKalb police spokeswoman Shiera Campbell said. — Please return to AJC.com for updates.	1

The sign. (Via @ryanjkelly) On one of the tensest nights in recent D.C. sports history, Washington fans took out their angst, energy, frustration, loathing, worry and agitation on the juiciest target of all: Metro. After weeks of concerns about the Nationals potentially playing a thrilling home playoff game with massive stakes while the mass-transit system shuttered early, the day finally arrived Thursday. Well, the night. Or Friday's early morning. Fans react to Metro's decision not to stay open late even though the Nationals-Dodgers Game 5 playoff matchup is likely to end after closing time. (TWP) Despite a busy day of last-minute pleas from local officials, WMATA stuck to its no-exceptions-for-late-hours SafeTrack promise, and the system closed at its regular time, with the announcement coming during that disastrous (for Washington) seventh inning. The response to that standard announcement? Boos. Chants. Boos and chants. Washingtonians united, as they are so rarely in these troubled times, coming together to support — or oppose, anyhow — one common cause.

by Paul Kay and Luisa Maffi cite 1. The World Color Survey The following four maps (132A, 133A, 134A, 135A) show the distribution of colour terms in some of the world's languages, based on the World Color Survey. This project, a collaboration of researchers at the University of California, Berkeley, and the Summer Institute of Linguistics (SIL), collected colour-naming data from 110 languages being studied by SIL linguist-translators in the late 1970s. For further details on methods and results of the World Color Survey see Kay et al. (1991), Kay and Berlin (1997), Kay et al. (1997), Hardin and Maffi (1997), Kay and Maffi (1999). 2. Basic colour term concepts In recent models of the universals and evolution theory of basic colour terms, stemming originally from Berlin and Kay (1969), three kinds of universal colour categories are recognized (Kay and McDaniel 1978, Kay et al. 1991, Kay et al. 1997, Kay and Maffi 1999): primary colour categories, composite (disjunctive) colour categories, and derived (intersective) colour categories. First, there are the six primary colours recognized in the widely accepted theory of colour opponency (Hering 1964 [1920], Jameson and Hurvich 1968; Hurvich 1982): Black White Red Yellow Green Blue These are the two pairs of fundamental opponent chromatic colours <Red, Green> and <Yellow, Blue> and the single pair of fundamental achromatic colours <Black, White>. Black and white are not opposed in the same sense as the chromatic pairs. For example, we can see a combination of black and white (gray) but there is no sensation consisting of the combination of red and green or of blue and yellow. (That blue and yellow pigments can be mixed to produce a green pigment is not relevant; there are no bluish yellow or yellowish blue sensations.) We will refer to the six colours black, white, red, yellow, green and blue as primaries. Secondly, there are composite categories consisting of fuzzy unions of the primaries. (Colour categories are modeled as fuzzy sets, that is, sets whose membership is a matter of more or less. For non-technical discussion of fuzzy sets, fuzzy intersection, fuzzy union, and related concepts in relation to colour categories, see Kay and McDaniel (1978); for technical discussion of fuzzy sets and fuzzy logic, see Zadeh (1996).) By far the most widespread composite in the ethnographic present is green-or-blue or "grue" (see Map 134A). Over half the languages in the World Color Survey contain a grue term. Other major composite terms documented in the World Color Survey are, using "/" for fuzzy union, Black/Green/Blue, White/Red/Yellow, Black/Blue, Red/Yellow, Yellow/Green/Blue, and Yellow/Green. (There is one, somewhat unclear, instance of a probable White/Yellow term in Waorani, an isolate of Ecuador.) There are also what we might call minor composites. For example, in systems that lack terms for purple and brown, these colours are often included in the black term. Similarly, in systems restricted to the primaries, non-primary shades such as brown, purple, pink, orange and gray are characteristically either split between two adjacent primaries or covered by a single adjacent primary. The third type of widespread colour category are the derived (intersective) categories, which are experienced as mixtures of the primaries. These are based formally on fuzzy intersections of primaries. Gray is experienced as a mixture of Black and White, pink of White and Red, orange of Yellow and Red, purple of Blue and Red, and brown (arguably) of Yellow and Black. 3. An evolutionary sequence of basic colour systems Figure 1 presents both a typology and an evolutionary sequence of basic colour systems covering 101 of the 110 World Color Survey languages. (The colour lexicons of the remaining nine languages are composed mostly of terms denoting categories appearing in Figure 1. Limits of space preclude further discussion here; see Kay and Maffi 1999.) Basic colour lexicon types are shown in square brackets and evolutionary stages are represented by columns, labeled with Roman numerals. For example, stage I contains a single type, consisting of two terms, one a composite of White, Red and Yellow and the other a composite of Black, Green, and Blue. (There are no stage I languages in the World Color Survey sample. Stage I is shown here for theoretical completeness.) Arrows indicate observed evolutionary transitions between types. Arabic numerals within brackets indicate the number of World Color Survey languages conforming to the corresponding colour lexicon type. Arabic numerals placed between basic colour lex	1
I like the concept and the stage sizes. Objectives aren't easy to find on the map. No gps type system. No control over the camera angle or zoom. Screen spins with every little twich of your thumb. Just try to kill an enemy with out going in a hundred circles, I dare you. Takes forever to find and complete objectives so you wont believe that there is more than one stage. Enemies become more spaced apart as you kill them off. No cheat codes (games this long need cheat codes). Don't believe me? Just look it up on YouTube. More	1
Seven Myths About the Iraq War: How BBC Newsnight failed journalism on the 10 year anniversary of the invasion by Nafeez Ahmed As a participant in BBC Newsnight special, "Iraq – 10 Years On", I found myself feeling slightly miffed at the lack of real debate on the crucial issues. On the one hand, Newsnight presented a number of narratives of the war and its aftermath as 'fact', which are deeply questionable. On the other, there were no serious, factually-grounded criticisms of the war, despite a diverse panel which included people who did not support it. As author of a major book on the war and its historical context, Behind the War on Terror: Western Secret Strategy and the Struggle for Iraq, as well as co-author of a new report, Executive Decisions: How British Intelligence was Hijacked for the Iraq War, I consider myself to be reasonably informed. Yet BBC Newsnight failed almost entirely to bring any of these issues to light. What follows is my Newsnight-inspired Iraq War Myth-Busting exercise, based on what was, and wasn't, discussed on the show. MYTH 1. Sectarian violence has increased in postwar Iraq because sectarianism has always existed in Iraq, and the removal of Saddam allowed it to erupt One of the first Newsnight bloopers started with a short introductory clip from John Simpson, the BBC's World Affairs Editor. Amongst other things, Simpson talked about the rise of sectarian Sunni-Shi'a violence in postwar Iraq, and argued that while Saddam's regime had clamped down on sectarian divisions, regime change effectively unleashed those previously suppressed divisions and allowed them to worsen. This was the first of many oversimplifications about the escalation of sectarian violence in Iraq. The reality, as pointed out on the show by my colleague in the audience, anthropologist Professor Nadje al-Ali, is that prior to the war, generic sectarian antagonism was unheard of in Iraqi society. Although Saddam's regime was unequivocally sectarian in its own violence against Shi'as and Kurds, as a mechanism of shoring up the Ba'athist regime, Iraqis did not largely identify in sectarian terms. As one Iraqi blogger living in Baghdad noted: "I always hear the Iraqi pro-war crowd interviewed on television from foreign capitals (they can only appear on television from the safety of foreign capitals because I defy anyone to be publicly pro-war in Iraq)… They go on and on about Iraq's history and how Sunnis and Shia were always in conflict and I hate that. I hate that a handful of expats who haven't been to the country in decades pretend to know more about it than people actually living there. I remember Baghdad before the war- one could live anywhere. We didn't know what our neighbors were- we didn't care. No one asked about religion or sect. No one bothered with what was considered a trivial topic: are you Sunni or Shia? You only asked something like that if you were uncouth and backward. Our lives revolve around it now. Our existence depends on hiding it or highlighting it- depending on the group of masked men who stop you or raid your home in the middle of the night." Missing from the BBC Newsnight discussion was the fact that the Bush administration planned from the outset to dominate Iraq by pursuing the de facto ethnic partition of the country into three autonomous cantons. The private US intelligence firm, Stratfor, reported that the US was "working on a plan to merge Iraq and Jordan into a unitary kingdom to be ruled by the Hashemite dynasty headed by King Abdullah of Jordan." The plan was "authored by US Vice President Dick Cheney" as well as "Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz", and was first discussed at "an unusual meeting between Crown Prince Hassan of Jordan and pro-US Iraqi Sunni opposition members in London in July" 2002. Under this plan, the central and largest part of Iraq populated largely by Sunnis would be joined with Jordan, and would include Baghdad, which would no longer be the capital. The Kurdish region of northern and northwestern Iraq, including Mosul and the vast Kirkuk oilfields, would become its own autonomous state. The Shi'a region in southwestern Iraq, including Basra, would make up the third canton, or more likely it would be joined with Kuwait.  Ultimately, of course, the specific detail of this plan did not come to fruition – but the 'divide-and-rule' imperial thinking behind the plan was implemented. As one US Joint Special Operations University report documented, "US elite forces in Iraq turned to fostering infighting among their Iraqi adversaries on the tactical and operational level." This included disseminating and propagating al-Qaeda jihadi activities by "US psychological warfare (PSYOP) specialists" to fuel "factional fighting" and "to set insurgents battling insurgents." Pakistani defence sources thus reported in early 2005 that the Pentagon	1

Text size: University Team Helps Real Benefits of Virtual Reality Come to Life Faculty, Students Work with Dallas-based Startup MyndVR to Create Content Aimed at Senior Citizens More than 250 senior living community residents in four states — Kansas, Florida, California and Texas — have participated in trials of the MyndVR virtual reality system, with encouraging results. For residents of senior living communities, a glance at the world beyond their walls can make a world of difference. A University of Texas at Dallas professor is working on technology that breaks down those walls, and a diverse team of UT Dallas faculty members and students is chipping in. Dr. Ryan McMahan of the Erik Jonsson School of Engineering and Computer Science has teamed with the innovators at Dallas-based startup MyndVR to provide virtual reality (VR) content aimed at senior citizens — a largely neglected audience within the primarily youth-targeted medium. "There are three ideas behind what these VR experiences allow these users," McMahan said. "Either they'll see something they've experienced before, which could bring about memories; experience a place they've never seen before, which engages the brain; or experience something that's completely impossible — the unique domain of virtual reality." McMahan first partnered with MyndVR in 2016, and recently joined its advisory board. Students in his graduate virtual reality course — from both the Jonsson School and the School of Arts, Technology, and Emerging Communication — created three distinct virtual environment prototypes for MyndVR's target audience. They include a nightclub complete with a live singer, an immersive sudoku game set above a koi pond, and a set of serene day and night environments ranging from mountains, lakes and beaches to the Taj Mahal. Three Tiers of Content Chris Brickler, co-founder and CEO of MyndVR, said his company's initial intention was to focus on a broad-spectrum, quality-of-life approach across a network of more than 50 long-term care and retirement facilities. "Our product road map envisions three tiers of content," Brickler said. "The first layer is recreational content — going to the Great Wall, swimming with dolphins and the like. Next would be therapeutic content — music, nature and brain exercises. "The top level, the uncharted water, is prescriptive digital therapy. MyndVR's goal is to provide virtual reality content customized to a user's diagnosis. That's why we're so excited about working with UTD on not only the development of the VR, but also the cognitive implications." For many students in McMahan's VR class, the MyndVR project was their first experience with an external stakeholder. UT Dallas graduate student Ariel Comstock and assistant professor Dr. Ryan McMahan (right) are playing key roles in the work of MyndVR co-founder and CEO Chris Brickler (left). Comstock coordinated four MyndVR trials at facilities around the country, and students in McMahan's VR class created content for the company's target audience. "Our partnership with MyndVR gave my students experience with a real company and real objectives," he said. "That collaboration was successful enough that MyndVR recruited one of those students as their first employee. She coordinated four MyndVR trials at facilities around the country." That employee — Ariel Comstock, a master's of fine arts student in ATEC — emphasized the role the VR experience can play in empowering MyndVR's audience. "MyndVR transports a viewer mentally away for the duration of the experience, and they finish feeling like they went somewhere," Comstock said. "For people who are not as agile as they once were, it can give them a sense of confidence, of agency — they choose where they want to go, and then go there." In conducting MyndVR's trials in Kansas, Florida, California and Texas — working with more than 250 seniors from ages 70 to 100 — Comstock has seen the extreme emotions that these programs can evoke. "I see wonder, awe and elation, but sometimes tears and sadness too," Comstock said. "I've also seen immersion to the extent that a senior who was experiencing 'MyMusic' — the 1950s nightclub — threw up her hands and sang along with 'New York, New York,' waving her arms as if she were performing herself." Brian Barnes, CFO/COO of The Legacy Senior Communities, observed similar effects during the trial at Willow Bend, a continuing care retirement community in Plano. "The MyndVR trial demonstrated a variety of benefits," Barnes said. "In one case, a resident living with Alzheimer's exhibited personality traits she had prior to the diagnosis, including dancing, smiling and singing. Another resident felt relief from symptoms of Parkinson's. The overall response has impressed everyone involved." 	1

A bill to create an athletic commission in South Dakota is going nowhere fast, largely thanks to the ignorance of Gov. Dennis Daugaard and state house Rep. Steve Hickey. Their primary objective is to ban sanctioned mixed martial arts in the state. In a blog post, Hickey writes that, "MMA Cage Fighting is the child porn of sports." The lack of knowledge and the lack of research both Daugaard and Hickey showed about MMA has to be frightening for persons who live in South Dakota. If they can't be bothered to do the minimal research required to learn that MMA is far safer than other "mainstream" sports, including football, it's scary to think about the laws they'll pass in the state regarding education, health care and budgets. The UFC is the largest MMA promoter in the world. No fighter has ever suffered traumatic brain injury, let alone died, in the UFC's 20-year history. A 2006 study done by researchers at Johns Hopkins University and which appeared in the Journal of Sports Science and Medicine found MMA has far less traumatic brain injury than other sports. Mixed Martial Arts competitions have changed dramatically since the first Ultimate Fighting Championship in 1993. The overall injury rate in MMA competitions is now similar to other combat sports, including boxing. Knockout rates are lower in MMA competitions than in boxing. This suggests a reduced risk of TBI [traumatic brain injury] in MMA competitions when compared to other events involving striking. MMA events must continue to be properly supervised by trained referees and ringside physicians, and the rules implemented by state sanctioning—including weight classes, limited rounds per match, proper safety gear, and banning of the most devastating attacks– must be strictly enforced. Further research is necessary to continue to improve safety in this developing new sport. A 2008 study released by the British Journal of Sports Medicine reached the same conclusions. After a five-year study, its authors wrote: Injury rates in regulated professional MMA competition are similar to other combat sports; the overall risk of critical sports-related injury appears low. Additional study is warranted to achieve a better understanding of injury trends and ways to further lower injury risk in MMA. The simple fact is that a random NFL player is at far greater risk of a serious brain injury than is a random MMA fighter. Sadly, neither Gov. Daugaard nor Rep. Hickey bothered to do much investigation or educate themselves before speaking out. South Dakota state house Rep. Mark Johnston introduced a bill to create an athletic commission in the state for the express purpose of making the sport safer. According to the Argus Leader, Johnston said his goal is to prevent unregulated events where tragedies could possibly occur. A state athletic commission's job is, at the core, to protect the fighters. It makes sure the proposed matches are fair and that promoters have doctors and an ambulance at all events. The commissions also require qualified referees, who stop fights when one fighter is in danger. It also requires fighters to undergo extensive medical examinations before fighting to make certain they are fit to compete. States such as Nevada, California and New York, with strong commissions, have discovered injuries fighters didn't know they had and prevented them from competing. That wouldn't be the case in South Dakota, with no commission to require those tests. Story Continues	1

Andrew Hoyle/CNET In August, drone manufacturer DJI announced the Phantom 3 Standard , an entry-level camera-toting quadcopter with autonomous flight modes that were oddly not available for its pricier linemates, the Advanced and Professional . That all changes on September 7 when a firmware update will add five of DJI's Intelligent Flight Modes to those models. These modes include waypoint navigation, point of interest (POI) flight planning and a Follow Me function. Waypoint navigation lets you set up a multipoint path for the drone to follow while you control the camera angle, and paths can be saved so you can recreate the flight again and again. POI flight planning allows you to set up an autonomous orbit around a subject at an altitude, distance and speed you select. The Phantom 3 will fly the path keeping the camera centered on your subject at all times. Follow Me uses the drone's transmitter and your phone or tablet to track your movements. This lets you use a Phantom 3 as a personal camera operator as it follows you at a fixed altitude and distance while you do whatever. Keep in mind, though, it won't avoid obstacles, so riding a bike trail through the woods probably won't end well. Joshua Goldman/CNET Also available are Course and Home Lock modes. The former makes all flight controls relative to your current position. That means moving the controller's stick left, right, forward or back will always move the Phantom 3 in those directions, regardless of where the camera is pointing. Similarly, enabling the Home Lock mode will make the orientation relative to yourself as the home point. This is helpful if you've flown beyond line of sight and want to return home but can't determine the orientation. Phantom 3 Advanced owners get a bonus, too: The firmware upgrade will add 2.7K (2,704x1,520-pixel) resolution movie capture at 30 frames per second. Lastly, a firmware update will also be available for the professional-level Inspire 1 that will add all of these Intelligent Flight Modes except for Follow Me.

It was a smashing weekend in Atlantic City, New Jersey for Royal Flush 2017, one of the premier tournaments and showcases for top Super Smash Bros. play. The tournament offered some of the best players in both Super Smash Bros. for Wii U (Smash 4) and Super Smash Bros. Melee (Melee). Editor's Picks Picking Coach of the Split an impossible task In a league where the role of League of Legends coach is still in development, how can anyone outside of an organization make an informed choice for Coach of the Split?

You'll find stats, standings, results, recaps and more, all in one place. 1 Related In Smash 4, it was the continuation of the ZeRo dynasty as Team SoloMid's Gonzalo "ZeRo" Barrios took down another major tournament. The king of Smash 4, with the coaching assist of Immortals' Jason "ANTi" Bates, walked out of Atlantic City as the victor of both the singles and doubles (with NRG eSports' Nairoby "Nairo" Quezada) tournaments. Although ZeRo took down the singles title, the journey was not easy or dominant. The competition, and some newer names, continued to creep up to contend with great finishes from Phoenix1's Gavin "Tweek" Dempsey, James "VoiD" Makekau-Tyson and Ramin "Mr.R" Delshad. Mr.R was the standout competitor from the field. The Sheik main used Cloud in the grand finals against ZeRo and was one scramble decision away from taking down the entire tournament. ZeRo needed a clutch ledge fight and multiple comeback decisions to overcome the relentless reads and pressure from Mr.R. It will be up to Mr.R to overcome the ZeRo hump (the pair played most recently at CEO Dreamland, another close affair) and take over the iron throne. The main event was Super Smash Bros. Melee and the top eight featured four of the best players in the world: Alliance's Adam "Armada" Lindgren, Team Liquid's Juan "Hungrybox" Debiedma, Cloud9's Joseph "Mango" Marquez and Team SoloMid's William "Leffen" Hjelte. Three of those listed were Evolution Fighting Game Championship winners and the other, Leffen, was routinely billed as the next legend in the game. Unfortunately for Leffen, his tournament was cut short by Hungrybox in a nail-biter set and a 3-0 drubbing by Sami "DruggedFox" Muhanna. In addition to eliminating Leffen, DruggedFox ran through Splyce's Michael "Nintendude" Brancato en route to a respectable fourth place finish. The storyline of the main event was once again centered around three of the game's most legendary competitors; Armada, Hungrybox, and Mango renewed their rivalries and took up the top three spots in the tournament. Hungrybox started in the winners bracket, but fell to rival Armada and Mango in winners finals and losers finals respectively. Mango, in signature fashion, fought through the losers bracket to enter the grand finals against Armada. In the grand finals, Armada shut down Mango's unorthodox offensive approaches. His defensive neutral air attacks, floats and ledge guards were so stout that Mango opted to use Marth on Final Destination for one game (he lost). It took unrelenting and fearless progression, but Mango created enough scramble situations to reset the bracket. In the final set, both players played to a fifth game stalemate. There, on Fountain of Dreams, Mango took his only decisive game. With the crowd behind him, and Armada seemingly out of steam, Mango lost only two stocks to finish the comeback victory.	1
Who are the Inuits? Who are the Inuits ? The Inuit are the aboriginal inhabitants of the North American Arctic, from Bering Strait to East Greenland, a distance of over 6000 kilometres. As well as Arctic Canada, Inuit also live in northern Alaska and Greenland, and have close relatives in Russia. They are united by a common cultural heritage and a common language. Until recently, outsiders called the Inuit "Eskimo." Now they prefer their own term, "Inuit," meaning simply "people." There are about 40,000 Inuit in Canada. Inuit Origins According to archaeological research, the origins of the Inuit lie in north-western Alaska. These first Alaskan Inuit lived on the seacoast and tundra, where they hunted seals, walrus, whales, and caribou. They lived in houses made of driftwood and sod, and almost certainly spoke an early version of the Inuit language, Inuktitut. They and their ancestors were the first Arctic people to become expert at hunting the larger sea mammals, such as the bowhead whale. The large volume of food that resulted from a successful hunt—even a small whale could weigh seven tonnes-meant that their way of life was richer and more secure than that of many other hunting people. The Inuit Move East Beginning about a thousand years ago, these early Inuit began to spread east into Arctic Canada. Within a few hundred years, they had replaced the earlier inhabitants of the region, a now-extinct people known to the Inuit as Tunit. This Inuit migration was not a single mass event, but probably involved dozens of small parties of perhaps 20 or 30 people moving east in search of a better life. A particular goal seems to have been the rich whaling grounds around Baffin and Somerset islands. Here they quickly replicated the large whaling villages and prosperous way of life they had left behind in Alaska. Other groups settled in coastal areas without rich whale resources, where they lived in smaller villages and depended primarily upon seals, caribou and fish. Everywhere they went, Inuit pioneers brought with them the heavy sod winter houses and elaborate hunting technology of their Alaskan ancestors. The Inuit and the Vikings By about AD1250, the first Inuit had entered Greenland through the Smith Sound area in the far northwest of the island. Here, possibly on the Canadian side, they first encountered medieval Norse ("Viking") hunters coming from the Norse colonies in southwest Greenland founded by Eric the Red. Eventually these Norse colonies disappeared, probably in the mid 1400s. There are different theories about their disappearance, but a deteriorating climate was one reason. Competition with the Inuit, who were far better adapted to Arctic life than the Norse, might also have been a factor. By the time of later European exploration in the 16th century, the Inuit were in sole possession of the entire North American Arctic. A Colder Climate The same worsening climate that spelled the end of the Norse colonies in Greenland also put severe strains on the Inuit economy. After about 1300, temperatures became progressively colder culminating in a so-called Little Ice Age around 1500. Rich and important whaling areas in the High Arctic were abandoned and people shifted southward. Bowhead whaling as the focus of Inuit life disappeared from most of Canada and Greenland (although not Alaska). Life generally became harder and more hand-to-mouth. People moved their camps and villages more frequently, and, in many areas, the old sod and whalebone winter house was abandoned in favour of houses made of blocks of snow. They were easier to build as they could be put up anywhere, even on the sea ice, and required only an hour or two to construct. Contact with Explorers Contact with European explorers also brought changes. Between the voyages of Martin Frobisher in the 1570s and the search for the missing Franklin expedition in the 1850s, dozens of expeditions to the Arctic set sail, usually from England. Most of them were in search of a Northwest Passage from the Atlantic to the Pacific. At first, Europeans did not see the Arctic as a place of value in itself, but as an obstacle blocking their way to the fortunes beyond. During their journeys through the North, European explorers often met Inuit. Few Europeans were unprejudiced enough to think they had anything to learn from the Inuit, but they did trade and exchange gifts. The Inuit began to learn about the outside world and to appreciate what it had to offer. The Europeans brought them iron, which they valued for making tools such as harpoon points and knife blades. The Whalers In the 1850s, Europeans and Americans began to appreciate the commercial value of the Arctic's animal resources. The North Atlantic commercial whaling industry, operating out of Britain and New England, began large-scale operations in what are	1

(Justin Sullivan/Getty) Why should a union representing workers who are not employees of McDonald's be empowered to squeeze concessions out of McDonald's? Why did Willie Sutton rob banks? In a party-line decision, the Democrat-dominated National Labor Relations Board has decided that employees of contractors can be treated as employees of other companies when . . . well, when it is convenient for Democratic constituencies that they be so treated. The underlying case involved an operator of recycling centers, Browning-Ferris Industries of California, which uses subcontractors to staff some of its facilities. Firms have many reasons for using subcontracted labor, one of which is avoiding entanglement with the NLRB. Tut-tut, say the feds. Advertisement Advertisement But in the more relevant cases, contracting is built into the business model, as it is with franchise restaurants and similar businesses, which are what this case really is about. Most people who work for McDonald's do not actually work for McDonald's Corporation, which operates only a small number of the burger joints bearing its name. The overwhelming majority of McDonald's restaurants are franchises, independent businesses ranging from one-shop outfits to very large operations, the owners of which pay a fee to McDonald's for the use of its name, business model, and supply chain. Your local fry-guy was not hired by McDonald's, cannot be fired by McDonald's, is not paid by McDonald's, and is not supervised by McDonald's. His terms of employment are not set by McDonald's but by his employer, the franchise operator. He is not an employee of McDonald's in any meaningful sense, but the Democrats on the NLRB are not interested in sense — they are interested in power. Union membership, particularly in the private sector, has been declining for decades. There are fewer than 8 million private-sector workers in unions, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. By way of comparison, there already are more than 2 million American workers employed in the so-called gig economy, working mainly as private contractors and individual entrepreneurs through firms such as Uber and AirBnB. It is very likely that within a few years there will be more Lyft drivers than Teamsters. Advertisement Advertisement Get Free Exclusive NR Content The political fallout of declining union membership presents a mortal threat to the Left's operating coalition. It's not just because of the money-laundering that converts union dues into Democratic campaign contributions, though that's not nothing; rather, it is that if fewer firms and economic sectors are under political discipline, then the value of being the party of government declines. When fewer firms are covered by, say, NLRB rules, then the political premium attached to being the rule-maker is diminished. Thus, the Left is scrambling to keep unionized firms under the federal thumb — consider the NLRB's improper attack on Boeing — while laboring to open up new avenues of union membership. Illinois insisted that privately employed home-health-care workers were "public employees" required to pay dues to the SEIU simply because their clients were Medicare recipients, a risible claim rightly thrown out by the Supreme Court (5–4, of course; liberal jurists are liberals first, jurists second if at all). The NLRB's ruling empowers the federal government to designate companies as "joint employers" on the flimsiest of grounds. For example, a corporation that requires all its franchisee owners to use the same scheduling software could be considered a joint employer for that reason alone. This is about enabling labor activists to exercise power over large businesses that are, for the moment, largely beyond their grasp. The NLRB and labor activists say that this ruling is necessary because in recent decades practices such as subcontracting and franchising have allowed many businesses to insulate themselves from direct NLRB oversight. This is true, and in many cases the avoidance of federal micromanagement almost certainly was an animating force. If the NLRB expects that businesses will sit still after this ruling, it is engaged in self-delusion: One of the few reliable effects of centralized regulation is that businesses will invest, and sometimes invest heavily, in regulation avoidance. There is probably no set of sustainable economic arrangements that will allow a single-parent fast-food employee to raise two children in the same comfort and security that might be provided by, say, a couple of married professionals. But the employees are incidental: This is about enabling labor activists to exercise power over large businesses that are, for the moment, largely beyond their grasp. Congress, happily, has the power to set aside this implausible overreach, which is exactly what it should do.	1
Inside the Paris apartment untouched for 70 years: Treasure trove finally revealed after owner locked up and fled at outbreak of WWII Caked in dust and full of turn-of-the century treasures, this Paris apartment is like going back in time.  Having lain untouched for seven decades the abandoned home was discovered three years ago after its owner died aged 91. The woman who owned the flat, a Mrs De Florian , had fled for the south of France before the outbreak of the Second World War. She never returned and in the 70 years since, it looks like no-one had set foot inside. Back in time: The flat near the Trinité church in Paris between the Pigalle red light district and Opera The property was found near a church in the French capital's 9th arrondissement, between Pigalle red light district and Opera. E xperts were tasked with drawing up an inventory of her possessions which included a painting by the 19th century Italian artist Giovanni Boldini. One expert said it was like stumbling into the castle of Sleeping Beauty, where time had stood still since 1900. 'There was a smell of old dust,' said Olivier Choppin-Janvry, who made the discovery.

The painting was by Boldini and the subject a beautiful Frenchwoman who turned out to be the artist's former muse and Mrs de Florian's grandmother, Marthe de Florian, a beautiful French actress and socialite of the Belle Époque.  Under a thick layer of dusk lay a treasure trove of turn-of-the-century objects including a painting by the 19th century Italian artist Giovanni Boldini Untouched: The cobweb-filled flat was discovered in the 9th arrondissement of Paris Treasure trove: Behind the door, under a thick layer of dusk lay a treasure trove of turn-of-the-century objects, including the Boldini painting that sold for £1.78million When the owner died died aged 91, experts were tasked with drawing up an inventory of her possessions Mrs de Florian fled Paris before the outbreak of war in 1939, which saw the Nazis invade France and reach Paris on June 14. Pictured here, German officers and Parisians mingle near a sidewalk cafe on the Champs Elysees on Bastille Day in 1940 Marthe de Florian was an actress with a long list of ardent admirers whose fervent love letters she kept wrapped neatly in ribbon and were still on the premises. Among the admirers was the 72nd prime minister of France, George Clemenceau, but also Boldini. The expert had a hunch the painting was by Boldini, but could find no record of the painting. 'No reference book dedicated to Boldini mentioned the tableau, which was never exhibited,' said Marc Ottavi, the art specialist he consulted about the work. When Mr Choppin-Janvry found a visiting card with a scribbled love note from Boldini, he knew he had struck gold. 'We had the link and I was sure at that moment that it was indeed a very fine Boldini'. He finally found a reference to the work in a book by the artist's widow, which said it was painted in 1898 when Miss de Florian was 24. The starting price for the painting was £253,000 but it rocketed as ten bidders vyed for the historic work. Finally it went under the hammer for £1.78million, a world record for the artist. 'It was a magic moment. One could see that the buyer loved the painting; he paid the price of passion,' said Mr Ottavi.

The Manstein Plan, as it became known, included a attack through southern Belgium that avoided the Maginot Line. The ultimate objective was to reach the Channel coast and to force the French government to surrender. Adolf Hitler gave his approval to the Manstein Plan on February 17, 1940, but it was not activated until the May 10.

Season three of Orphan Black is about to debut. The highly acclaimed BBC America TV show has been licensed this year by AMC, making it more widely available. Still, the two channels may not be in everyone's menu. For you, Amazon has a solution, though you may need a bit of caffeine to capitalize on this one. While seasons one and two have been available for some time to Prime subscribers, those who don't pay Amazon $99 per year can now catch up on season one -- providing you do so this Friday. "Orphan Black has been extremely popular with Prime members since the series became available exclusively in Prime Instant Video -- that's why we're excited to make season one available to all customers for free, for a day," says Michael Paull, Vice President of Digital Video at Amazon. "We saw an incredible response when we made our Golden Globe-winning original series Transparent available to everyone, so we're giving customers an opportunity to try out another great series that Prime members already love". We won't give too much away, it's something you have to watch for yourself and season one is the place to start if you don't want to be completely lost. Amazon claims that this approach helped propel its original series Transparent to a Golden Globe award by allowing more people to view the show. Tatiana Maslany gives an epic performance in the role (roles), so take this Friday off from work (you owe it to yourself, right?) and spend some time as a couch potato. You can grab the show here.	1
During a sophomore season that saw Tyler Seguin come up a goal shy of 30 and three points shy of 70, he finally turned 20. He had become a Stanley Cup champion the year before, in 2011, and seemed on the verge of making the leap from good to great. When that didn't happen the following season - he put up 32 points in 48 games, followed by an uninspiring eight points in 22 playoff games - the Bruins sent him packing to Dallas. This is what's known in hockey circles as an "organizational oopsie." Fast forward a year, and I feel comfortable floating out a few questions: could Tyler Seguin lead the NHL in scoring one season? If so, how soon? Could it be this season? You likely noticed that the young center had a nice year with Dallas, but "nice year" doesn't really do it justice. He finished alone in fourth in the NHL with 84 points, and helped make up one of the most dynamic duos in hockey alongside Jamie Benn. He took 294 shots (fourth-most in the league), leading to 37 goals on a wholly sustainable 12.6% shooting percentage (sustainable for an elite shooter like Seguin, that is). He got a step faster and noticeably stronger; it wasn't luck. His possession stats were also shiny, for those so inclined. He saw a 52.3% share of the shot attempts while he was on the ice, and pushed that to 61.8% in playoffs - a time when he undeniably would have been the focal point of the opposition. Pushing through and improving on his already great regular season performance implies he's a player with the drive the Bruins implied he wasn't. Seguin is going to have even more help this season. Occupying the spot largely filled by Rich Peverley and then-rookie Valeri Nichushkin last season will likely be Ales Hemsky, a skilled disher whose likely to maximize the output of two pure shooters. Benn himself will be 25 and fully into his scoring prime while coming off a season that saw him represent Team Canada and set career highs in [fill in a category of your choice]. That won't hurt much, nor will Dallas having some young D-men that look poised to take a step in the right direction. Statistics show that elite scorers peak earlier than most fans think, but that tends to mean somewhere around 24-25, not 27-28. At 22, Seguin is just on the verge of sliding into his prime - a crazy concept for a guy who just finished with more points than names like Alex Ovechkin, Corey Perry and Jonathan Toews. Clearing the obvious hurdle Oh, right. Reigning "World's Best Hockey Human" Sidney Crosby still exists. That's a bit more than a speed bump. I'm not naive enough to believe that Seguin is going to suddenly make up the 20 points Crosby beat him by this past season, but there are some reasons to believe he could substantially close that gap, and hope for a little luck. For starters, Crosby's linemates are only getting older, which means they ain't getting better - and might be getting worse. Chris Kunitz will be 35 this year, which is well into the years of statistical decline for scorers. Kunitz was above a point per game in the lockout shortened year, and he was 10 points under it last season; his fall-off might be underway as we speak. Pascal Dupuis is 35 with a huge career games played total as a guy who's only topped 50 points once. Unless Sid is tied to Evgeni Malkin he won't have a ton of help, and if the Pens hope to present themselves as a team with real depth, they're probably best keeping their two elite centers separated. The other factor here, is that Crosby's had some well publicized injury trouble in his career. You hope it never befalls Sid again, but Seguin has only missed 11 career games over four NHL seasons. If the Pens captain runs into any more trouble, the league leaders list will be there for the taking - and ol' Ty-Ty has proven pretty durable. Obviously Seguin wouldn't be alone in the chase for the Art Ross. Taylor Hall is at an almost identical place in his career, though playing on a worse team probably makes topping the league scorers list harder (as does his more reckless style, in terms of games played). Malkin and Patrick Kane both missed substantial playing time last year, with the former being a legit threat for the league's top spot when healthy. If Claude Giroux gets off to anything other than an atrocious start like last year, he showed he can be better than a point-per-game guy. But there's little doubt that Seguin now warrants mention with the guys listed	1
EUGENE, OR—Arriving back at work after a two-week winter vacation, local marketing assistant Matthew Bueso told reporters Monday he was happy to return to the office with a fresh and rejuvenated loathing for his job. "It's always nice to get away for a few weeks, clear my head, and come back invigorated with a newfound disgust for my place of employment and the various responsibilities of my thoroughly depressing job," said Bueso, 38, noting that his time away had inspired him to complete mind-numbing administrative tasks, engage in idle discussions with his aggravating coworkers, and listen to bullshit inspirational speeches from his boss with a rekindled sense of anger and despair. "I'm rested, my batteries are recharged, and I'm ready to despise my entire professional life more intensely than ever before!" At press time, a revitalized Bueso was furiously balling his fists at the sound of a nearby coworker's loud typing. Advertisement	1
The narrow Kerch Strait, which ranges from 4.5 to 15 kilometres wide and connects the Black Sea and the Azov Sea, is known as a convenient place for offshore ship-to-ship transshipment. Every year more than 15 million tons of cargo – predominantly oil, grains and fertilisers – are processed through the anchorage areas in the strait. More than 95% of this volume comprises Russian-origin commodities shipped from ports on the Volga and Don Rivers and the Caspian Basin by coaster ships, which is then transshipped onto large ocean-going vessels. Transshipment in the Kerch Strait has faced a number of natural, political and legal issues over the years. The relatively shallow waters of the strait do not allow for safe passage of Panamax and Capesize vessels when fully laden. Moreover, a tangle of legal conflicts and loopholes has turned the strait into a 'grey zone', with the biggest problem being the strait's lack of clear legal status. In accordance with Article 15 of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea 1982, where the coasts of two states are opposite or adjacent to one another, neither state is entitled (failing agreement between them to the contrary) to extend its territorial sea beyond the median line, every point of which is equidistant from the nearest points on the baselines from which the breadth of both states' territorial seas are measured. This provision does not apply where it is necessary, by reason of historic title or other special circumstances, to delimit the territorial seas of the two states in a way that is at odds with the convention. The Kerch Strait is a special case, as it is impossible to delimit the territorial waters at the median line. Therefore, the status of the strait has been determined by special agreements between Ukraine and Russia. The Treaty between Ukraine and the Russian Federation on Cooperation in the Use of the Azov Sea and Kerch Strait stipulates that the ​​Azov Sea and the Kerch Strait have historically been the internal waters of both Ukraine and Russia, and that the settlement of all issues related to the Kerch Strait is to be carried out by agreement between the two countries. The border between Ukraine and Russia has not yet been officially demarcated. In practice, this means that neither Ukraine nor Russia has full jurisdiction and control over the strait. This lacuna has led to the development of ship-to-ship transshipment and bunkering on anchorage places in the strait. Some of these anchorage areas are located within the Ukrainian zone of responsibility, while others are in zones controlled by Russia. Although Ukrainian authorities have control over anchorages in respect of vessel traffic and navigational safety, they do not have territorial jurisdiction over the areas defined as 'transit anchorage places'. Anchorage areas are not included in the water areas of Ukrainian ports, so no state control procedures govern them. These anchorage areas are not a part of Ukrainian customs or state territory. Thus, technically all operations are arranged outside Ukrainian borders. The obvious advantage for shipowners and cargo shippers is that transshipment and bunkering operations are undertaken under a 'transit' regime, thus avoiding customs clearance, border control and other types of government surveillance. This also allows for bunkering and transshipment without formally calling the vessels at port – therefore avoiding both payment of port charges and the need to obtain free practice for vessels. However, the Ukrainian authorities have recently attempted to take control over transshipment on transit anchorages. In June 2013 the Cabinet of Ministers passed a decree that the anchorage areas within the Ukrainian zone of responsibility be included in the official water area of the port of Kerch. In view of international law and the bilateral treaties between Ukraine and Russia, the validity of this decree may be dubious. Following the decree, the State Customs Service required that thorough customs control be exerted over all transshipment operations undertaken by vessels in anchorage areas. The customs authorities insist that the anchorage areas in the Kerch Strait fall within Ukrainian customs territory. However, considering the legal status of the strait as the 'internal waters of Ukraine and Russia', and in the absence of demarcated borders in the strait, this requirement is questionable in terms of territorial jurisdiction. Despite the fact that there are neither legal grounds nor effective fulfilment mechanisms for this requirement, the authorities are likely to continue attempts to expand their jurisdiction over the anchorages. In practice, this implies the abolition of the existing transit regime and the loss of all incentives for ship-to-ship transshipment in Ukrainian anchorage areas. The Ukrainian Sea Ports Authority recently initiated a series of lawsuits against shipping agents in an attempt to recover unpaid port charges for the vessels which operated in anchorage transshipment zones after the decree of the Cabinet of Ministers came into force. The reasoning given was that all anchorages fall within the remit of port waters, and are thus subject to port charges.	1

Psychiatric service dogs are allowed in most public places, while emotional support animals are not. Service dogs play an essential role in the lives of many individuals with disabilities. Federal law grants certain rights and protections to people with disabilities who use guide dogs or service dogs. Access to Public Places and the ADA Different laws govern the use of service animals in different contexts. The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) governs the use of service dogs in public places. The ADA guarantees people with disabilities who use service dogs equal access to public places such as restaurants, hospitals, hotels, theaters, shops, and government buildings. This means that these places must allow service dogs, and the ADA requires them to modify their practices to accommodate the dogs, if necessary. However, these protections only apply to dogs that satisfy the ADA's definition of "service animal." The ADA defines a service animal as a dog that is "individually trained" to "perform tasks for the benefit of an individual with a disability." The tasks a dog has been trained to provide must be directly related to the person's disability. A "helper monkey" or a cat cannot be considered a service animal under the ADA; the ADA limits the definition of service animals to dogs. In some limited circumstances, the ADA provides that public places should also accomodate persons with disabilities who use miniature horses to perform tasks. The best-known example of service dogs are guide dogs that help blind people navigate safely around obstacles. Service dogs can also be trained to assist deaf individuals, wheelchair-users and other people with mobility impairments, as well as people who have psychiatric, intellectual, or other mental disabilities. Psychiatric Service Dogs "Psychiatric service dogs" are service dogs that provide assistance to people with psychiatric disabilities, such as severe depression, anxiety disorders, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Examples of work or tasks that psychiatric service dogs perform include: providing safety checks or room searches for individuals with PTSD blocking persons in dissociative episodes from wandering into danger (for example, traffic), and preventing or interrupting impulsive or destructive behaviors, such as self-mutilation. Emotional Support Animals Many individuals—both with and without disabilities—derive emotional support and comfort from dogs and other animals that are not specially trained to perform specific tasks directly related to a psychiatric disability. The ADA considers such "emotional support animals" to be distinct from psychiatric service dogs, and treats them differently. The ADA does not grant emotional support dog owners the same right of access to public places that it gives to individuals who use psychiatric service dogs. That means that under the ADA, a movie theater, for example, must allow psychiatric service dogs to accompany their owners into the movie auditorium but can refuse to admit individuals with emotional support dogs. The Difference Between a Psychiatric Service Dog and an Emotional Support Dog It is not always clear—to staff at public places, and even to some people with disabilities—whether an animal accompanying an individual with a psychiatric disability or impairment is performing a psychiatric service or "merely" providing emotional support. Confusion may result in unlawful and discriminatory treatment of people with disabilities. The key distinction to remember is that a psychiatric service animal is actually trained to perform certain tasks that are directly related to an individual's psychiatric disability. The dog's primary role is not to provide emotional support. It is to assist the owner with the accomplishment of vital tasks they otherwise would not be able to perform independently. In addition, a psychiatric service dog must not only respond to an owner's need for help, the dog must also be trained to recognize the need for help in the first place. A dog must be able to respond and recognize to be a service dog. By contrast, an emotional support dog is a pet that is not trained to perform specific acts directly related to an individual's psychiatric disability. Instead, the pet's owner simply derives a sense of well-being, safety, or calm from the dog's companionship and physical presence. The animal companionship of an emotional support dog can have genuine therapeutic benefits for individuals with psychiatric disabilities and less severe mental impairments. But unless the dog is also trained to work—to independently recognize and respond to its owner's psychiatric disability—the dog does not qualify as a psychiatric service dog and does not receive the protections of the ADA. For example, people with social phobia might only feel safe enough to leave their home for food or medication if their dog accompanies them. Such a dog would be considered an emotional support animal. If, however, the same person is prone to dissociative episodes when they leave home, and their dog is trained to recognize and respond to the onset of such an episode by nudging, barking, or removing the individual to a safe location, then the dog would be considered a psychiatric service dog.

Team, Over the past few weeks, I've shared with you our mission, strategy, structure and culture. Today, I want to discuss our plans to focus our talent and investments in areas where we have differentiation and potential for growth, as well as how we'll partner to drive better scale and results. In all we do, we will take a long-term view and build deep technical capability that allows us to innovate in the future. With that context, I want to update you on decisions impacting our phone business and share more on last week's mapping and display advertising announcements. We anticipate that these changes, in addition to other headcount alignment changes, will result in the reduction of up to 7,800 positions globally, primarily in our phone business. We expect that the reductions will take place over the next several months. I don't take changes in plans like these lightly, given that they affect the lives of people who have made an impact at Microsoft. We are deeply committed to helping our team members through these transitions. Phones. Today, we announced a fundamental restructuring of our phone business. As a result, the company will take an impairment charge of approximately $7.6 billion related to assets associated with the acquisition of the Nokia Devices and Services business in addition to a restructuring charge of approximately $750 million to $850 million. I am committed to our first-party devices including phones. However, we need to focus our phone efforts in the near term while driving reinvention. We are moving from a strategy to grow a standalone phone business to a strategy to grow and create a vibrant Windows ecosystem that includes our first-party device family. In the near term, we will run a more effective phone portfolio, with better products and speed to market given the recently formed Windows and Devices Group. We plan to narrow our focus to three customer segments where we can make unique contributions and where we can differentiate through the combination of our hardware and software. We'll bring business customers the best management, security and productivity experiences they need; value phone buyers the communications services they want; and Windows fans the flagship devices they'll love. In the longer term, Microsoft devices will spark innovation, create new categories and generate opportunity for the Windows ecosystem more broadly. Our reinvention will be centered on creating mobility of experiences across the entire device family including phones. Mapping. Last week, we announced changes to our mapping business and transferred some of our imagery acquisition operations to Uber. We will continue to source base mapping data and imagery from partners. This allows us to focus our efforts on delivering great map products such as Bing Maps, Maps app for Windows and our Bing Maps for Enterprise APIs. Advertising. We also announced our decision to sharpen our focus in advertising platform technology and concentrate on search, while we partner with AOL and AppNexus for display. Bing will now power search and search advertising across the AOL portfolio of sites, in addition to the partnerships we already have with Yahoo!, Amazon and Apple. Concentrating on search will help us further accelerate the progress we've been making over the past six years. Last year Bing grew to 20 percent query share in the U.S. while growing our search advertising revenue 28 percent over the past 12 months. We view search technology as core to our efforts spanning Bing.com, Cortana, Office 365, Windows 10 and Azure services. I deeply appreciate all of the ideas and hard work of everyone involved in these businesses, and I want to reiterate my commitment to helping each individual impacted. I know many of you have questions about these changes. I will host an employee Q&A tomorrow to share more, and I hope you can join me. Satya	1
When lasers cut something, they're only cutting in the sense that they're making atoms be not as attracted as they once were to each other. When you get down to the nitty-gritty details, it is not really the same as mechanical cutting. Remember that lasers shoot photons, and when photons hit atoms, they excite electrons. If you excite these electrons enough, they'll have enough energy to disassociate from the atoms they formerly "belonged" to. This makes individual atoms disassociate with whatever other atoms they were once bonded to, and in the mad scramble to go to a lower energy state, they very likely do not go into the same configuration they were before. Some atoms, like the ones directly hit by the laser beam, go to a vapor and float away. Others "choose" one side of the material to go to. Any bonds the material had with itself is then dissolved, so it is effectively cut. This is different than, say, taking shears or scissors to the material. The methods of those things cutting are purely mechanical, and you don't have to worry about vapors as much as when cutting with a laser. (You also don't have to worry about reflections from materials, either!)	1
"IS" is and interactive experience where you should answer questions having only three answers. This was a study of GameMaker:Studio text manipulation made on 15 hours and part of making a game a week. I've made "IS" to talk to people, as a theme served on a plate, as a topic to say "hello! I think this and that", so if you look at it, and then play it, leave something, i want to argue, i love to argue with someone.  You will only need the Z X C keys to play it, i really recommend using headphones.  ---------------------------------------------------------------- Thanks to the awesome cactus for the music!

"I do not believe that there is any credible scenario in which Japanese government debt can be repaid in the normal sense of the word repay," said Adair Turner, chairman of the Institute for New Economic Thinking and a former head of Britain's financial regulator. "It would therefore be useful to make clear to the Japanese people that the public debt does not all have to be repaid, since some of it can be permanently monetized by the Bank of Japan."	1
MSPaint is actually a very powerful image editor. Here's all the things about MSPaint you probably didn't know. Chapter 1 - Brush Scaling This is pretty much the most basic thing here. You may think that the standard brush sizes in MSPaint only come in the three sizes, right? Wrong. Open up a new document in paint, select the paintbrush tool, hold Ctrl and press the + button on the numpad. The brush size will grow as big as you need! Amazing, huh? This technique also works with the line tool, the spraypaint tool, and the eraser tool. Chapter 2 - Custom Brushes This is the one that NOBODY knows - You can make your own custom brushes in paint! Select the pencil tool and draw yourself a small textured brush in X color. Here's what I did: Now, select that little image, turn transparency on, hold shift, and drag it around! Cool, huh? You can draw ANYTHING and do this. Here's another one I did. Chapter 2 1/2 - The 'Stamp' Tool This is something I improvised. It's the 'Stamp' tool. I didn't put it in its own chapter because technically it's part of chapter 2, but moreso different. So, I have this image of an old lady: And I want to put these leaves in her hair. Now, I could copy and paste all day, but there is an easy way around this. Select the leaf, turn transparency on, and drag the leaf to wherever you want it. Whenever it's there, while it's still selected, hold shift, click once, release shift, and drag the image away. :O! It stamped! Repeat as necessary ( I rotated too. ) Chapter 3 - Image Scaling So say you scanned something and the image is WAY too big and you want it smaller. How do you go about that? Well, open up paint and paste your image in. I didn't have anything massive to scan so I used this picture of a Dr Pepper. Now, say you want it smaller. You probably try to highlight it and scale it, right? It ends up looking compressed and improportioned. Well, there's an easier way. All it takes is a single keystroke! Ctrl+Plus(Numpad) to make it larger or Ctrl+Minus(Numpad) to make it smaller. This is especially useful for scaling sprites, as it keeps their pixels proportional. Chapter 4 - Color Replacement Say you have drawn something with an absolutely crazy pixel border, and all of a sudden you don't like the border color. Like this box I drew. Now, I want to re-color the border yellow but I have absolutely 0 time and 0 energy. What do I do? I use the COLOR REPLACEMENT FUNCTION! Select the eraser tool. In the primary color box, select the color that you don't like that you want to erase. In the secondary color box, select the color you want to replace said exiled color with. Then hold right click and sweep with the eraser tool over the ugly color. If your drawing is large, scale the eraser brush as needed. Ta-da! Chapter 5 - The Grid Say that you're trying to edit a piece of pixel art that you drew, and, even though you're zoomed in all the way, you're having trouble fine tuning - you're having trouble positioning the crusor where you want. This is where the grid comes in. MSPaint comes with a built-in grid feature, accessable by hotkeys. To view the grid, simply zoom in to either 6x or 8x, and hit Ctrl+G. Chapter 6 - Other Things Another feature of paint that is more commonly known about is the 'quick undo' feature. It doesn't really have that much use, and, more often than not, is accidentally toggled by the user. This ends up in frustration. So let's say that you're drawing a smiley face, and you get the eyes down good. So then you move onto the mouth, you start drawing, and it's going good. But just then, suddenly, you launch into an epileptic seizure. Your body flails around wildly, and, unfortunately, your hand is not an exception to the flailing. That seizure just done gone and [messed] up your artwork! But, for whatever reason, your finger is still pressed down on the mouse. 	1
The minimization procedures… have been so frequently and systemically violated that it can fairly be said that this critical element of the overall BR regime has never functioned effectively. ...the government acknowledges that NSA exceeded the scope of authorized acquisition continuously during the more than [redacted] years of acquisition under these orders. There may well be explanations for each of the compliance incidents documented in the Walton and Bates opinions; that's not the point. Instead, the larger message that comes through these newly disclosed opinions is the pervasiveness of compliance incidents, and the extent to which careful supervision by the FISA Court, while apparently able to produce some accountability in response to such incidents (as in the opinions released yesterday), simply does not seem to have mooted these concerns. That is to say, with every new FISA Court opinion responding to new compliance incidents, it becomes that much harder to trust that compliance concerns are ancient history. Throughout this process of discussing the NSA's surveillance efforts, thanks to Ed Snowden and his whistleblowing, defenders have continued to insist (1) that the NSA isn't abusing its powers and (2) that there's tremendous oversight of the NSA's activities, mainly by FISC. Yet, with this week's declassification of a second FISC ruling in which a judge detailedby the NSA, with no consequences, does anyone actually believe the NSA has stopped abusing its powers to violate everyone's privacy?As a reminder, back in September it was revealed that FISC judge Reggie Walton was pretty angry about abuses by the NSA:Then there was Judge John Bates' ruling just revealed this week:These are different violations. And, yet, in both cases, they seemed to indicate rather systematic abuses by the NSA, and very little concern on the part of the NSA to get it right. After all, these problems appeared to go on for years, and were either unreported or not clearly reported to the FISC, which could do little about it.And that raises a key question, pointed out by Steve Vladeck -- Given these two relatively recent rulings, detailing systematic, widespread and long-term abuses by the NSA in violation of the law, how can any NSA defender claim with a straight face that the NSA is now in compliance Of course, when there's no real "cost" for being non-compliant, why would the NSA care that much about being compliant?	1
MIAMI — On January 31, 2013 American Airlines launched their first Boeing 777-300ER into service with attention that rivaled any airline's launch of a new type in recent memory. On the face of it, even though American became the first operator of the 777-300 in America, this event would almost seem overkill if for that reason alone. After all, American began 777-200 flights back in 1999 and On January 31, 2013 American Airlines launched their first Boeing 777-300ER into service with attention that rivaled any airline's launch of a new type in recent memory. On the face of it, even though American became the first operator of the 777-300 in America, this event would almost seem overkill if for that reason alone. After all, American began 777-200 flights back in 1999 and the first 777-300 was first delivered to an airline, Cathay Pacific back in May, 1998 . The first 777-300ER entered service nearly 10 years ago with Air France. Boeing's two stretch variants of their venerable cash cow, the 777, easily have become the type's most popular versions with over 680 orders and deliveries between them out of the entire 777 program's 1,380 orders and deliveries. (as of December, 2012). In an era of smaller airliners, American inaugurated the 777-300, the largest new airliner by a U.S. carrier since the last Boeing 747-400s entered service with U.S. airliners in the late 1990s. This inaugural, flight 963, from Dallas/Ft. Worth to São Paulo, Brazil in the author's view is one of the most significant in the airline industry in years because it is about something much bigger than just the launch of a new airliner, it's about the re-birth of a proud American institution that happens to bear the name of our country – American Airlines. American Airlines problems are well known. After becoming the world's largest airline with its 2000 acquisition of TWA, the 2000s were not kind at all to the Silver Bird. TWA and American merged during an economic downturn and by most accounts, the merger was anything but an unqualified success. American shed most of TWA's assets, routes, staff, and many of its aircraft. On September 11th, 2 of American's airliners, their crew, and passengers were forever lost in the atrocities of this horrible day. As if things couldn't get any worse, the world's airline industry hemorrhaged with the U.S. legacy carriers losing more money during this time then they had profited in their entire history. All of them declared Chapter 11, with the exception of American. Under the category of "no good deed goes unpunished", this decision would come back to haunt American for years. The competitors were able to re-organize, upgrade service, rebrand their images, get their costs under control, renew their fleets, expand their route structure, and finally in the case of Continental/United and Delta/Northwest consolidate into mega-carriers that dwarfed American. American was left with a barrage of serious problems: a revolving door in the executive ranks, fractious management and labor relations, dwindling market share, increasingly massive financial losses as their competitors recorded profits, devastating operational problems of which many were self-inflicted, an aging fleet, outdated and stripped down in-flight passenger service, soaring operating expenses, declining bookings, and a very unsympathetic press that at times almost seemed on a witch hunt. Like Pan Am and other failed airlines there were a few bright spots: the extremely profitable Latin American hub, the North Atlantic / London Heathrow joint-venture with British Airways, the strong and dominant hubs particularly at DFW and Miami, strength on the highly profitable trans-continental services particular JFK-LAX, and many proud employees across all positions who still believed their company could once again live up to American's 1980s advertising claim that they were "Something Special in the Air". But the headwinds seemed to far outweigh the tailwinds and finally on November 29, 2011 American filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy becoming the last U.S. legacy carrier to do so. On top of that, US Airways began aggressively pursuing a merger, securing an agreement with the pilots unions. Then came the 2012 "Summer of Discontent" with flight cancellations and operations disruptions that sent customers into the arms of their competitors and who can forget the seats onboard a few 757s becoming unbolted during flights. It would have been understandable for the once proud Eagle to fold its wings. If the one unthinkable collapses of majors like Pan Am and Eastern occurred, could American meet the same fate? It may be hard to remember, but since the beginning of commercial aviation: American was an innovating pace setter in the industry, and generally a profitable one at that. In many ways, American virtually wrote the history of the airline industry: American introduced the airliner that changed aviation, the Douglas DC-3. The first	1

The Role of Belgian Colonization After WWI, the Treaty of Versailles was signed and it affected Germany in many ways. One way was the colony of Rwanda-Urundi was taken away from Germany and made a League of Nations protectorate that was put under Belgian rule. The Belgians reinforced the class system that the Germans had imposed, further separating the Tutsies and the Hutus. The Belgians favored the Tutsies (even though they only made up 14% of Rwanda, whereas the Hutus made up 85% of the country. The Tutsies were given many privileges that the Hutu were not fortunate enough to receive, including western-style education and political power. The Belgians used the Tutsi to rule the country, having these people enforce what the Belgians believed and what the Belgians wanted done. Therefore the Tutsies were essentially puppets and the Belgians were the puppet masters. The Belgians insisted that Rwanda start to grow coffee, the corvee was introduced (this is form of labor in which each worker is whipped eight times before work each morning). The onerous corvee was not popular and many people fled to Uganda. I would have left Rwanda if I was a slave because being beaten before I started my day would make me not want to work and it would enrage me everyday. The Belgians began to focus more and more on race and they did studies that proved, in there eyes, that the Tutsies were superior. Scientists were brought into the country to measure skulls sizes (to see which group of people had a bigger skull and therefore a bigger brain-now we know that brain size is irrelevant to intelligence). Tutsies were also taller and lighter skinned so the Belgians believed they were of Caucasian decent, therefore making them "better" than the Hutus. Racial identification cards were also distributed which identified if the citizens of Rwanda were Hutu or Tutsi. As time went on, the idea that the Tutsies were superior to the Hutu became so ingrained in the minds of the Tutsies that they started to believe this idea and exploited their power over the Hutu. Resentment, anger, and confusion flooded the hearts and minds of the Hutu. These emotions started to build up over time and as the people entered the 1990's, these emotions were about to explode.

The Marine Corps has suddenly dropped criminal charges against an officer in the infamous Taliban urination video case, heading off what promised to be an embarrassing pretrial hearing for the Corps' commandant Wednesday. Defense attorneys for Capt. James V. Clement had won a judge's order, over objections from Marine prosecutors, for two staff attorneys to testify in open court about how senior commanders interfered in the case to get a guilty verdict. The attorneys also were seeking to question Gen. James F. Amos, the commandant, and wanted access to his private emails. But the criminal case ended Friday when Lt. Gen. Kenneth J. Glueck, who heads Marine Corps Combat Development Command in Quantico, Va., and was overseeing the prosecution, filed a brief court paper withdrawing the charges. John Dowd, Capt. Clement's principal defense counsel, accused the commandant of engineering the largest case of unlawful command influence in the Corps' history. "The withdrawal of the charges was another act of cowardice by the commandant, his counsel and the Judge Advocate Division of [Marine Corps headquarters] to cover up the worst case of unlawful command influence in the history of the Marine Corps, which was beginning next Wednesday to be uncovered in a hearing before the chief judge … on several motions to compel discovery," Mr. Dowd said Saturday. The defense attorney said he wanted to see email traffic among the commandant, his counsel and his legal division. "That email traffic would have revealed that [the commandant] and his lawyers had engaged in a secret, corrupt effort to rig and control the investigations and dispositions of the so-called desecration cases until Capt. Clement refused to submit to a corrupt process [of being] charged with crimes he did not commit," Mr. Dowd said. Capt. Clement's defense counsel obtained a sworn statement from Lt. Gen. Thomas D. Waldhauser who, as convening authority, was overseeing all cases in the urination incident. The general told of a one-on-one meeting in 2012 with Gen. Amos in which the commandant said he wanted Marine defendants "crushed" via courts-martial. Gen. Waldhauser went on to become Defense Secretary's Chuck Hagel's senior military adviser. Citing that conversation, Capt. Clement's attorneys accused the commandant of blatant unlawful command influence that denied their client a fair court-martial. They filed a motion to dismiss the charges, thus setting up a series of public pretrial hearings on Gen. Amos' conduct scheduled to begin Wednesday. Capt. Clement was charged with dereliction of duty for not properly supervising Marines who urinated on Taliban corpses. A video of the act went viral on YouTube last year, drawing harsh criticism from the White House. The captain denies any misconduct. Maj. James Weirick, a staff attorney at Quantico who was to testify Wednesday, filed a complaint with the Pentagon inspector general over Gen. Amos' actions. An investigation is underway. Gen. Amos, through an aide, later told Gen. Waldhauser that he regretted his orders and decided to replace him. "The commandant immediately realized that he had compromised the situation and took immediate action to ensure that the investigation and cases were given to an appropriate new convening authority who could exercise independent and unfettered discretion to take action in those cases," a Marine spokesman said this summer. The Washington Times was not able to get a comment from the Corps. Gen. Glueck's order did not explain why he was dropping the charges. He ordered that Capt. Clement undergo an administrative board of inquiry, which will determine whether he committed misconduct. The board can decide whether he should be retained or separated under less-than-honorable conditions.  Copyright © 2018 The Washington Times, LLC. Click here for reprint permission.	1
KITIGAN ZIBI ANISHINABEG FIRST NATION, Quebec — Jay Odjick's affinity for comics started early. He bought his first Spider-Man comic book for 20 cents at the age of four. And it wasn't long before he felt the pull to write stories of his own. "My mother says I started writing my own comic stories when I was around five," Odjick said. "But the caveat I always add is that my mother doesn't say I started writing good stories." Odjick has steadily improved his skills over the years. Now 39, he's the creator of "Kagagi," a graphic novel that's professionally published and distributed across North America. Like many graphic novels, "Kagagi" includes evil villains and superhuman powers. But what makes this comic book unique is that the characters and the storyline are deeply rooted in Algonquin culture. Odjick, who is from the Kitigan Zibi Anishnabeg Algonquin First Nation in Quebec, is one of a growing number of indigenous writers and artists who are jumping into the billion-dollar comics industry. Many bring their own life experiences and cultural traditions to their stories. And critics say their work is starting to reshape the way indigenous people are portrayed in this popular medium. I thought it was really important that I create heroes that young Natives could relate to. Jon Proudstar, comic book artist In "Kagagi," Odjick's culture plays a central role from the very beginning, as the storyline springboards off of the Algonquin legend of Windigo, the story of an evil creature with the power to possess humans and turn them into cannibals. The victims become "kind of like zombies," Odjick said. And the only person who can stop the Windigo? A 16-year old Anishnabe boy with superhuman strength and the ability to fly. An animated version of "Kagagi" currently airs on the Aboriginal Peoples Television Network, a cable channel whose programming reaches about 10 million households throughout Canada. Each episode is broadcast in both English and Algonquin. In a world where many indigenous tribes struggle to maintain their language, Odjick says he is excited about the opportunity to help preserve part of his culture "I'm not an educator," he says, "but we can present language in a way that's entertaining to [kids]." Finding new heroes According to Michael Sheyahshe, author of "Native Americans In Comic Books," Odjick's celebration of Native culture is a long way from how Native Americans were portrayed in comics when the medium first rose to popularity. Sheyahshe, who is a member of the Caddo Nation in Oklahoma, says when comic books first began seeing major commercial success in the 1940s, Native Americans were only written as diminutive one-dimensional characters and often portrayed as a threat to white protagonists. By the 1960s and 1970s, though, Native characters began to play a more centralized role in storylines as various civil rights movements took hold throughout the United States. Sheyahshe cites Marvel's Red Wolf, a nine-issue series that featured the publishing house's first Native American superhero, as an example. Cover of Jon Proudstar's "Tribal Force" Jon Proudstar Still, Sheyahshe says that in that time period, almost none of the Native characters were the main heroes. "They're the helpers. They did what they were supposed to," he said. "[The heroes] couldn't have gotten the job done without them, but [Native characters] didn't have series of their own." Sheyahshe says it has only been in recent years that he's begun to notice Native artists producing comic books starring Native characters. One of the first on the scene was Jon Proudstar's 1996 series "Tribal Force," a story about five young people granted supernatural powers in order to protect their land from being destroyed by the government. Proudstar said he also takes great pride in his attention to detail. He didn't just stick with characters from his own community near Tucson, Arizona. Each of his characters comes from a different tribe, and he spent a lot of time making sure their cultures were accurately and respectfully depicted. "I knew very little about the Hunkpapa Sioux," he says, "So I went to a couple of people who are Hunkpapa and asked them about their communities, what's important to them." His White Calf Buffalo Woman is one result of this research. After Proudstar learned that depictions of the White Calf Buffalo Woman are among the culture's most sacred images, he adapted her character to appear in the book as only a silhouette. Proudstar said seeing Native American stereotypes and inaccuracies continue to show up in comic books was a big motivation for his work. But Proudstar also wanted to create a universe in which heroes face the same challenges that many Native kids face today, like living with the effects of fetal alcohol syndrome and child molestation,	1
Neill Blomkamp is embarking on an experimental filmmaking venture that he's calling Oats Studios. The District 9 and Elysium director released a trailer for some of the studio's upcoming projects, which will be released to Steam in the next couple of months. The trailer opens with a shot of an overgrown Eiffel Tower, as a voiceover explains that aliens have come to exterminate humanity. The trailer then shows off quite a bit more: a woman shooting an alien in a red-lit corridor, American soldiers flying over Vietnam, trucks flying Texas flags driving through the desert, a whole bunch of cool-looking aliens and quite a bit more. The trailer explains that what's coming soon is a series of short, experimental films called Oats: Volume 1. Blomkamp has been teasing hints about Oats Studios for the last year, asking if fans would be interested in buying films off of Steam, and posted some intriguing images to Twitter, showing off one of the aliens seen in the trailer, as well as a Vietnam-era soldier. Earlier this month, he showed off a 15 second teaser showing off a soldier shooting down... something. If I sold experimental short films on @steam_games as tests for potential full feature films, would people watch them? — NΞill Blomkamp (@NeillBlomkamp) April 9, 2017 While Blomkamp earned considerable acclaim for his debut feature District 9, he got his start with short films, such as Alive in Joburg (which became District 9), Landfall, a short Halo film (his debut film was originally supposed to be an adaptation of the Bungie franchise), and more recently, an entry in BMW's The Hire series, featuring Clive Owen. From the looks of it, these upcoming short films will be a set of really exciting science fiction films. The trailer simply says that Oats: Volume 1 will be streaming soon. Whenever it hits, Oats Studios has our attention, and we already can't wait to see what Blomkamp has up his sleeve.	1
As of December 19 Brampton-bound travellers will have to pay careful attention to what platforms at Union Station they need to board. For Brampton commuters who are used to arriving and departing from platform 7, 8, 9, and/or 10, your new platform is now 11 and 12. The change will affect departures on December 19, starting with the 3:35 p.m. westbound trip. The change will be permanent until further notice. GO Transit is encouraging people to leave extra time to learn the new platforms, and to avoid crowding situations. In readying for the next phase of rebuilding the Union Station train roof, four platforms will be closed and three will be re-opened. This process is expected to repeat until the entire train shed is restored in two years. Comments comments	1

Amy Schumer uses her upcoming Netflix premiere The Leather Special to mock "gun nuts" for opposing her gun control efforts. Schumer began to speak publicly for gun control after John Russell Houser allegedly shot and killed two persons during an airing of Schumer's Trainwreck in a gun-free theater in Lafayette, Louisiana. According to The Daily Beast, Schumer talks about gun control in her new special, then hedges her statements by saying "What I learned was, no matter what you say, as soon as you say the word 'gun,' what gun nuts hear is, 'She wants to take all our guns!'" What Schumer misses is that she has worked with her cousin Senator Chuck Schumer (D-NY) to push expanded background checks because of the shooting, although the shooter passed a background check to get his gun. "Gun nuts" fail to see the sense in pushing to expand what already failed. But Schumer tries to explain her calls for more background checks by pointing to the mental condition of the Lafayette shooter. She suggests that "even someone who is mentally ill and has been convicted of domestic violence can still obtain a firearm due to various background-check loopholes." To be fair, this is not true. Individuals who are involuntarily committed for mental illness treatment are barred from buying guns–involuntarily commitment is a threshold that must be crossed. But the judge who handled John Russell Houser's mental oversight– Carroll County Probate Judge Betty Cason–said she never ordered him involuntarily committed. So, there already is a mechanism for keeping the mentally ill from obtaining guns, but they have to meet a certain threshold before being barred from gun purchases. Instead of admitting this, Schumer just mocks the system. She points to blind people and people on the terror watch list buying guns, then says, ""I'm all about equal rights for the disabled, but if Stevie Wonder calls me and he's like, 'Do you want to go shooting today?' I'm going to be like, 'Hard pass!'" Schumer does not mention the fact that neither the terror attack in San Bernadino (December 2, 2015) nor Orlando (June 12, 2o16) would have been stopped by adding the terror watch list to background checks because none of the attackers in either case were on the list.

You may have heard that Ubisoft have a new Tom Clancy game coming out this year called The Division. If you've played literally any other Tom Clancy game before, you probably have a pretty good idea on what The Division is like. Wait, no. That's not right at all. The Division is unlike any Tom Clancy game you've played before. That's because it's a big open-world RPG. Yeah, like those games with dragons, but this time it's bio-terrorism instead. That may sound strange, but The Division is actually really good at being a role-playing game. Here's ten reasons why The Division is the next big thing in PC RPGs. 1 – It's genuinely an RPG Let's get one thing straight: The Division is an RPG. And I don't mean it's a third-person shooter with some upgrade stats: this is a full-out, numbers-led RPG to stand in the stables next to Diablo III and Borderlands. Both you and enemies have hit points, you can increase your weapon DPS by bolting on mods, and you level up by gaining XP for kills and quest completion. It's even got a character creator. The only way it could be any more RPG is if Chris Avellone was writing it. "From the beginning when we set out to do an RPG," explains creative director Magnus Jansén. "We wanted to do something where your investment and your tactics matter." Because it's an RPG, The Division's combat is nothing like the one-hit-kill firefights of other Tom Clancy games. "To honour your [weapon and skill] choices, and doing tactical combat in the RPG setting, we've made some concessions to the absolute reality," says Jansén. As such, enemies must be fired upon until their HP depletes, rather than simply double-tapped in the head. "We keep you immersed with the fact that enemies have body armour and various things to explain why some people take a lot more damage than others," explains Jansén in regards to the more bullet sponge-y enemies. 2 – It's not competing with the MMO crowd MMO's have their definition in the title: massive, multiplayer, and online. While The Division is online and multiplayer, it's certainly not massive in terms of players. In the questing zones of its Midtown Manhattan, you'll be with just three other co-op players at most. Head into the Dark Zone – the highly contaminated PvP area at the centre of the map – and things get busier, but not by much. "It's not a crowded place," reveals Jansén. "We want to keep encounters something interesting, so the Dark Zone is not crowded." The technical numbers behind the Dark Zone is support for about 20 – 24 players, but you'll likely never see that many all in one area. "There are lots and lots of square miles, so we tried to fill that up with people to reach a certain density," says Jansén. "You'll walk a couple of blocks and you're likely to maybe see one person. If you make a lot of noise, like during an extraction, then you're likely to attract a handful of people, maybe one or two groups." Basically, your immersion in the world won't be ruined by a server of 200 people teabagging corpses. 3 – It's proper Tom Clancy Did you know that The Division is real? Well, sort of. It's based on Operation Dark Winter, a simulation carried out in 2001 by the American government to see how well the country would cope with a smallpox epidemic. The answer was pretty simple: we're doomed. Society and infrastructure would collapse, leading to disaster in the streets. That's scary for us in real life, but it's the perfect start to a Tom Clancy novel. Since Tom himself is no longer with us, it's left to Ubisoft to tell the tale. For The Division, the epidemic all starts on Black Friday, with the virus being passed around on banknotes. Get it? It's the downfall of capitalism thanks to rampant consumerism. Clever, eh? Saving us all from anarchy are the agents of The Division themselves: men and women with access to tons and tons of military hardware, ready to shoot the heck out of those who would try and destroy America by looting the abandoned buildings of New York. Yup, this is a Clancy story alright. 4 – It's an open world that feels real It's mandatory to have an open world in RPGs these days, and The Division certainly has one. It's a close-enough 1:1 recreation of Midtown Manhattan, complete with major spots like Madison Square Garden, Times Square, and the Lincoln Tunnel. Because of the strive for accuracy, you won't find a single copy-paste street corner in The Division. And thanks to being a	1

The world's largest asset managers have held secret summit meetings to hammer out proposals for improving public company governance to encourage longer-term investment and reduce friction with shareholders. Jamie Dimon, chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, and Warren Buffett convened the sessions with the heads of BlackRock, Fidelity, Vanguard and Capital Group to work on a new statement of best practice that would cover the relationship between US companies and their investors. The unusual collaboration comes at a time of rising shareholder activism and a raging debate about whether public markets demand short-term profits at the expense of long-term investment. Andrew Hill Lasting lessons for smug CEOs and somnolent shareholders Directors must call out poor managers before they destroy the companies they run In recent years, some private companies have shunned early public listings, and technology bosses such as Michael Dell have argued that equity markets are too focused on short-term gains. Some large technology groups have also gone public with dual-class share structures that limit shareholder rights in an effort to minimise the influence of activist hedge funds. The asset management bosses, including Abby Johnson of Fidelity, Larry Fink of BlackRock and Tim Armour of Capital Group, met most recently at JPMorgan's New York headquarters in December, the Financial Times has learnt, following a first meeting in August. The group is discussing a statement of best practice on corporate governance. Discussions have focused on issues such as the role of board directors, executive compensation, board tenure and shareholder rights, all of which have been flashpoints at US annual meetings. Mr Dimon, in particular, has reason to hope for a rapprochement between boards and long-term shareholders. He has faced personal criticism for combining the role of chairman and chief executive at JPMorgan, and at the company's last two annual meetings, more than a third of its shareholders voted that he should split the roles. As well as being a major player in capital markets, JPMorgan also has an asset management arm that is one of the US equity market's largest investors, with $1.7tn in assets. Mr Buffett, a long-time friend of Mr Dimon, has eschewed many corporate governance norms at his company, Berkshire Hathaway. Other contributors to the initiative are understood to include Mark Wiseman of the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and Jeff Ubben of ValueAct, an activist hedge fund manager. Podcast Alphachat: How short-termism is misunderstood Credit Suisse's Michael Mauboussin discusses corporate short-termism with host Cardiff Garcia No participants agreed to be quoted on the initiative, which is not expected to come to fruition for several months. The asset managers hope to come up with a list of best practices that they will support at the companies they invest in. The move comes amid a debate on shareholder rights and responsibilities and on the balance of power between investors, boards and management. Activist hedge funds with more than $100bn in assets have used their muscle to demand board changes and push companies to increase returns to shareholders, often through share buybacks. The largest companies typically face a half-dozen or more votes from dissident shareholders at each annual meeting, on topics ranging from executive compensation to environmental policies and political lobbying. An increasing number of US companies have also agreed this year to offer long-term shareholders the right to nominate their own candidates for board directors. The volume of initial public offerings tumbled 42 per cent in the US last year despite the growing economy, as companies sought investors — including some traditional public markets investors — who were willing to buy shares even while they remained private.

How to Preload Images "Preloading" loads an image file into the users' computer memory so that it can be instantly accessed when needed. This is useful, for example, if you have a mouseover event and an image needs to change without any delay. Option 1: Nice and Simple To preload an image into your web page, paste the code below into the document head (replace the red image file name with your own): <script type="text/javascript"> if (document.images) { img1 = new Image(); img1.src = " image.jpg "; } </script> You can add more images by duplicating the image lines, e.g.: <script type="text/javascript"> if (document.images) { img1 = new Image(); img1.src = " image.jpg "; img2 = new Image(); img2.src = " image2.jpg "; } </script> Option 2: A Flexible Array This method can be used if you have an external JavaScript file that is used by multiple pages. Use the same function to easily preload any number of images on different pages. Firstly, add the following function to your main JavaScript file: function preload(images) { if (document.images) { var i = 0; var imageArray = new Array(); imageArray = images.split(','); var imageObj = new Image(); for(i=0; i<=imageArray.length-1; i++) { //document.write('<img src="' + imageArray[i] + '" />');// Write to page (uncomment to check images) imageObj.src=imageArray[i]; } } } Then in the <head> of each web page, add the following code after you've called the main JavaScript file: <script type="text/javascript"> preload(' image1.jpg , image2.jpg , image3.jpg '); </script> Replace the file names in red with your own files. You can have as many as you like, just make sure that they are separated by a comma. Option 3: No JavaScript You can also preload an image without JavaScript by creating a 1 pixel square version of the file and hiding it somewhere on the page, like so: <image src="picture.jpg" width="1" height="1" border="0">	1
Taking Stock Next session, I shared the list of problems I was able to compile. Problem #1: Logistics. I have the asset sheet, but don't know how to quit my job and convert my net worth into income I can live on. Problem #2: What comes next? I have absolutely no idea what to do with the next phase of my life. I just know I don't want to be in my industry anymore. It isn't that I hate it. I don't. It's just that it no longer provides significant challenges or pleasure. I'm suddenly unsure if it ever did. My role is mostly mechanical: I go through the motions. I'm an expert. I receive work and I do it and I don't think twice about whether or not I'm enjoying it. It just happens – it's part of me. How do I get rid of this? Problem #3: What happens to my previous life? What will I tell people? Will I lose friends? What will I do with the loss of structure? Problem #4: What will I do to make me feel like I'm giving back? I don't think that what I currently do is all that important, but at the very least, I perform my function well and folks are happy with my contributions. This gives me some small sense of value and esteem. What will replace this? Problem #5: Purposelessness at work. Although I produce some amount of valuable work for my employer every week, most of the hours are spent idling. I'm stuck there, cannot leave, cannot work-from-home, and cannot stand this aspect of the job now that I'm FI. It was tolerable in the past, when I had a slow stint at a previous employer, but that's because I still really needed the salary, which filled me with a sense of purpose and made the idleness seem like a useful activity by the fact that it was driving me toward completion of a long-standing goal. Problem #6: The Bucket of Fear. I have all sorts of concerns about moving from FI to RE status, most of which I articulated in this post. At the time of these issues, back in 2013, the biggest one was the idea that I'd do nothing — absolutely nothing — after retiring. Maybe I'd become like Peggy Bundy on Married… With Children, watching soap operas during the day and eating bon-bons. Or, worse, I'd return to my old drinking problem. Problem #7: I Feel Older. With age, most people feel a decreased sense of possibility in life. Fewer paths are available to follow. Many of your choices have already been made. You have launched. There is no returning to Earth for another unique blastoff in a totally different direction; your primary trajectory has been defined, for better or worse. This isn't to say that there aren't plenty of paths still open to you, but the fact remains that some are closed. For example, you will not, at age 35, become an Olympic-calibre swimmer. (You could, however, still become a good one.) Problem #8: My Significant Other is Not Totally Cool With All Of This. Enough said. I added that some of these problems I think about frequently — like the finances, and feeling purposeless — while others I do my best to ignore. After I dumped all of this stuff on him, Dr. Katz told me to start working on logistics first. My suggestion? Tackle the finances immediately. It'll be the easiest to resolve because it's strictly a numbers game and it'll be good to cross something quickly off your list. You think you have enough to retire? Well, you don't have to prove it to me. You have to prove it to yourself. Break things down and get comfortable with your own plans. Only you can assert that you're fully covered on this. Do the research that needs to be done. Crunch numbers. Create spreadsheets. Find Jesus. Whatever it takes. He also immediately commented on #4, Giving back, telling me that this is all in my head. I don't have to give back to anyone, ever. I know, it's just one man's opinion, but he was very clear and passionate on this point. I wondered briefly if he was a Libertarian. And to be honest, this completely shocked me. The last thing I expected was for a goddamned therapist to tell me something is quote all in my head. I thought these people (read: analysts) were, as a rule, paid to indulge their clients — to say precisely the opposite. Something along the lines of: Oh, well you think that way because of your upbringing. But let's examine the substrate of these mental patterns: Tell me about your mother. Still, his point was clear: I needed to stop worrying about the expectations of others, the	1
EA's press conference may not have revealed a ton of new info about Mass Effect: Andromeda, but it offered a brief glimpse of the return of the Mako. That's right, the bouncing, rubbery, ice skate with wheels is back. But don't groan just yet. BioWare has been doing some interesting work to make sure that the Mako is more universally liked this time around - and that involves getting a little help from a team that knows its stuff about racers.  Both Mac Walters (Creative Director on Mass Effect: Andromeda) and Aaron Flynn (general manager at BioWare) were very forthcoming that the Mako wasn't just awkward to drive, but that you couldn't do a lot of interesting stuff with it. "So that's all going to get fixed," Flynn tells me. "When we thought about bringing the Mako back, we said: 'We can't bring the Mako back as an iteration of the Mako. It has to be a high quality experience that compares well to any driving simulation by doing that.'" So what do you do when you need to overhaul your vehicles, and you're part of a huge corporation with teams working on multiple different kinds of projects? You bring on the Need for Speed team to help out. "One really fortuitous thing is that, because so many other teams are on Frostbite now, the Need for Speed folks had done a couple of games on Frostbite at that point," Flynn explains. "They were more than happy to lend a hand and offer advice and guidance to our developers to make sure that the Mako, when we actually get it all done, drives and plays great. It doesn't feel like you have those many, many edge cases the Mako in [the first Mass Effect] had where you could do crazy stuff with it. So that won't be there, knock on wood."  Making the Mako control well, and making it take advantage of the newer open spaces all goes back to a single point: that the team wants to make the Mako actually fun to play. "I think we've approached pretty much everything with Mass Effect: Andromeda that we shouldn't have assumptions about the way we've done things in the past," Walters tells me. "Some things have worked very well, other things haven't, so we looked at the Mako, we said 'Is it fun?' That had to be the question we wanted to answer first. And then, 'is it serving the purpose of exploration that we wanted it to?' We put a lot of effort into it early on to sort of answer those questions."	1

Is climbing ruining your posture? Climbing is great exercise for your arms and back, but is it also affecting your spine in a negative way? Climbing uses a constant rowing motion, or a downward pulling motion. These types of motions utilize muscles in your back like: the latissimus, rhomboids, middle and lower trapezius. These muscles often play a role in good posture, they keep your shoulders back and your spine upright. So, how might climbing be making your posture worse? It is the simple resting posture on the wall. Climbers do this naturally to be more efficient in their muscle use. Do you tend to rest; how often and for how long on each climb? Most climbers will tell you to take rest brakes on the wall and let everything "hang loose" and relax the muscles in your back and even in your arms. This is done to use your body in the most efficient way and expend the least amount of energy. This is where the problem lies because normal resting posture puts your spine in a position called kyphosis.There is a natural kyphosis in your mid back but we are putting that to the extreme when we climb. Our normal population and especially the younger generations are already increasing this kyphosis with electronics use and regular sitting/standing posture. So, for us climbers, we need to prevent our physical activities from increase this kyphosis even further! Why is this bad? A limitation in the thoracic spine, or mid back, can often lead to back pain, shoulder pain, and neck pain. When one segment in the body is limited it affects everything else above and below that segment. What can you do to change this? The answer is simple! You need to work on extension in the mid back as well as opening the front of your body. Then train the muscles in your chest to equalize your strength ratio from front to back. Below are some examples of exercises and soft tissue releases that can help protect your back, neck, and shoulders to keep you reaching new heights!

BY: Follow @BillGertz  Sunni extremists are infiltrating the United States with the help of alien smugglers in South America and are crossing U.S. borders with ease, according to a U.S. South Command intelligence report. The Command's J-2 intelligence directorate reported recently in internal channels that "special interest aliens" are working with a known alien smuggling network in Latin America to reach the United States. The smuggling network was not identified. Army Col. Lisa A. Garcia, a Southcom spokeswoman, did not address the intelligence report directly but said Sunni terrorist infiltration is a security concern. "Networks that specialize in smuggling individuals from regions of terrorist concern, mainly from the Afghanistan-Pakistan region, the Middle East, and East Africa, are indeed a concern for Southcom and other interagency security partners who support our country's national security," Garcia told the Washington Free Beacon. "There are major hubs that serve as entry points into the region for migrants from those areas of concern attempting to enter the U.S. along our border with Mexico," she said. The infiltrators from terrorist states and unstable regions exploit vulnerabilities in commercial transportation systems and immigration enforcement agencies in some of the countries used for transit, Garcia said. "In 2015, we saw a total of 331,000 migrants enter the southwestern border between the U.S. and Mexico, of that we estimate more than 30,000 of those were from countries of terrorist concern," she said. Another problem in dealing with migrants from the Middle East, North Africa, and South Asia is a lack of information among the governments of the countries used by potential terrorists for transit. The exploitation of alien smuggling networks by terrorists until recently had been dismissed by both American security officials and private security experts as largely an urban myth. However, the Southcom intelligence report revealed that the threat of Islamist terror infiltration is no longer theoretical. "This makes the case for Trump's wall," said one American security official of the Southcom report. "These guys are doing whatever they want to get in the country." Adm. Kurt Tidd, Southcom's commander, said last week that the lack of information is hampering security efforts against alien smuggling. "An element that has been long recognized is that our ability to track people moving through transportation systems is an area that we must continue to devote efforts on, and the ease with which human traffickers are able to use our transportation systems to move people through the networks relatively undetected should give us all concern," Tidd said. Special interest aliens are described by the U.S. government as aliens who pose a potential terrorism threat coming from 34 nations in the Middle East, Africa, Southwest Asia, Central Asia, and East Asia. The list of states of concern includes Afghanistan, Iran, Kuwait, Iraq, Lebanon, Syria, Eritrea, Libya, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, Indonesia, and Malaysia. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump last week called for stepped up counterterrorism measures that he said would involve "extreme vetting" of immigrants in a bid to better screen out potential terrorists. Trump also has made a campaign theme the construction of a wall across the United States' southern border as part of efforts to better control the flood of illegal immigrants. Joel Vargas, head of Contingent Security Services and a consultant to law enforcement agencies, said there is no evidence Sunni extremists are creating new relationships with alien smugglers. However, he said in an email that "existing smuggling networks from Central America are increasing their access." "We have intercepted immigrants coming from Asia but we have been unable to determine if they are extremists," Vargas said. "Our Sunni illegal migration coming from [Latin America] is very small. On the other hand, they can use the networks set up by the Shia." A report produced by Vargas for the International Airport, Seaport and Transport Police states that the Iran-backed Shiite terror group Hezbollah mainly has ties to Latin American through overseas Lebanese expatriates. Hezbollah recently increased support in transnational crime in the region by supply arms and training to various groups. "Hezbollah's current goals appear to be focused on accruing resources rather than conducting offensive operations, however the group's growing capabilities are still a clear threat to regional U.S. interests," the report said. "Iran's involvement in Latin America is also increasing, and Hezbollah will likely be able to use these budding political and economic ties as cover for its operations." Vargas said Hezbollah's networks in Latin America could be used by Sunni extremists to get to the United States. "That is a workable situation," he said. "If they disclose they are ISIL or any other group, I doubt that even the Shias will help out. Even [drug] cartels are killing anyone who appears extremist. It is bad for their business." According to Vargas, Guatemala remains a weak link	1
Photo It seemed quixotic at first, but maybe the idea of turning the Tappan Zee Bridge into a walkway after a new bridge is built is not so far fetched after all. State officials said Wednesday that they were exploring the possibility of turning the three-mile-long bridge into a route for pedestrians and bicyclists along the lines of the High Line on the West Side of Manhattan, or the equally successful Walkway Over the Hudson linking Poughkeepsie and Highland. Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and aides said at a cabinet meeting in Albany that it would cost $150 million to demolish the existing bridge, which carries the New York State Thruway, so turning it into a walkway connecting Rockland and Westchester Counties was worth exploring. "Could you leave it up, and what are the economics and the practicalities of that?" Mr. Cuomo said at the meeting. "It's an exciting option." Advertisement Continue reading the main story After more than 10 years of study, building a new bridge finally seemed to reach critical mass last fall when it was one of 14 projects chosen by the Obama administration for expedited federal review and approval — possibly allowing work on a new $5 billion bridge to begin as early as spring 2013. The bridge is 56 years old — 6 years past its anticipated life span — and needs $50 million in maintenance and repairs annually.	1

Phoniks 12 Super Funky Remixes of Classic Wu-Tang Hits – "Shaolin Summer: The Remixes" The Wu-Tang Clan is one of the most respected hip-hop groups in music history. This is no secret. If one was reworking music from their extensive and rather notable discography extreme caution must be used. One of Phonik's first songs that got a lot of steam of Soundcloud and beyond was his remix of "C.R.E.A.M."(dolla dolla bill y'all). Just this week Phoniks released a new mix-tape full of a bunch of uptempo funk and disco style remixes. These include heaters like "Criminology" and "3 Bricks". As Phoniks gears up to release "Knowledge Of Self" with Awon this fall he first surprises us with this funky mid-summer offering. A 12-track remix tape featuring jazz-funk and disco based flips on classic Wu-Tang material including songs such as "C.R.E.A.M.", "Gravel Pit", and "Criminology". Phoniks takes performances that were originally spit over RZA's dark, chilling instrumentals and turns them into upbeat, funk-driven summer jams. The high tempo disco breaks's take the listener up past the mid-way point in the album where they succumb to more traditional jazz and soul style instrumentals that will keep the head nodding until the finish line. Altogether a very enjoyable listen on a nice summer day and what should become a staple in hip-hop head's summer playlists. This embed is invalid About Phoniks Phoniks is a hip-hop producer from Portland, Maine known for his vintage-90's boom bap production style and melodic jazz and soul samples.

Ugh. I seriously hate my life. Everything's just so messed up right now. I just need a minute to vent about it or something. Maybe that'll help me feel better. So, I tried talking to Tante Joce the other day about moving out… And she just shut me down! She wouldn't even listen to what I had to say! She just kept saying all this shit about how I can't afford it – even though I have tens of thousands of euros sitting in a bank account waiting for me! Actually more like hundreds of thousands, I bet. Papa and Onkel Florian's band never really hit it as big as other bands out there, but I'm not an idiot. I know they did pretty damn well for themselves. And I know Papa left me more than enough to be able to live on my own! But of course Tante Joce said no. And when I even said I'd get a job to pay for rent instead (which I'd totally be willing to do!) she still shot me down! This is exactly what I'm talking about when I say she babies me – she won't listen. She won't give me a chance! It made me so mad… And then I kinda made things worse, I guess. I ended up calling her a bitch. And I've never called her that before. Ever. I still feel like shit for saying it. I mean, no matter how ridiculous or unfair she was being, Tante Joce didn't deserve that. I know she didn't. Me and my big mouth. Dom says I totally blew it. He thinks she'll probably never understand what I was trying to say, because she'll be too caught up being mad that I called her a bitch. And I kinda can't help worrying that he might be right. But Remi made me feel a little better, at least. He says River's called Tante Clara a bitch a bunch of times, but it always blows over. "Mama knows she doesn't mean it," he told me. "I'm sure this'll be the same." And I really, really hope he's right. Because I know I can't apologize now, no matter how bad I feel. It's too late. It's been too long. And it'll make it look like I'm saying she was right or something. And she wasn't. She was being ridiculous and overprotective, just like she always is. Anyway, I think Remi maybe had a point. I mean, it's been like three days, and Tante Joce still hasn't mentioned it. So maybe she's over it? Of course, she hasn't really said much to me at all, to be honest. Neither has grandpa. Or Oma and Opa. It almost feels like Tante Joce asked them not to. I mean, grandpa's been giving me these… 'looks', y'know? Like he really wants to say something. But he never does. I guess they've all kinda been looking at me a little weird though. Sometimes it's like they're mad. But other times it's like they're… nervous? Waiting for something to happen, I guess? It's kinda hard to explain. Even the girls noticed something was up. The three of them cornered me after dinner last night and asked me what happened… They could tell there was something weird going on. So I told them about it (minus the part where I called their mom a bitch… Something told me that wouldn't be the best idea). Tony got all nervous and started spewing all the same garbage Tante Joce was saying about why moving out's a bad idea and how Tante Joce is just worried about me and blah blah blah. Typical Tony. I get that she's trying to help, but… Ugh. And I couldn't believe it, but Alex actually laughed at me. She told me I'm being an idiot, and says everyone's probably acting funny because they're waiting for me to blow up and start "throwing a temper tantrum" again. Yeah, whatever. I'm starting to think I should have reserved the "bitch" title for her instead of Tante Joce… Charlie was the only one who was at least a little helpful. Or at least not mean. Or annoying. She did roll her eyes at me though… But anyway, she thinks they're afraid I'm gonna try to run away or do something stupid like that. "If you do, it's over." That's what she told me. She says if I'm serious about this thing, I need to give it some time, then try asking again another way. And in the meantime I should try to "earn some brownie points". Sounds like the best option, I guess — Play nice	1
The ferry lies on its side just the way it was when it sank on April 16, 2014. The hull shows clear signs of deterioration after being trapped at the bottom of the ocean for three years, with the letters "Sewol" largely erased by to the elements. The ferry Sewol was finally raised above the surface of the ocean on Thursday, 1,073 days after it sank off the southwest coast of Korea with over 300 mostly teenage passengers on board. As salvage efforts picked up speed, a portion of the hull rose 10 m above the surface later in the morning. But then salvage workers encountered an unexpected problem. A 10 m ramp at the rear of the vessel used to load and offload vehicles was discovered to be open. The locking mechanism that holds it closed apparently broke when the ship hit the seafloor. That makes it impossible to move the ferry into the cargo bay of a semi-submersible structure that will transport it to dry dock. Salvage workers struggled all night to remove the ramp before the notoriously rough waters off Jindo grow dangerously choppy again at noon on Friday. It finally came loose at around 6:45 a.m. The ferry is now being hoisted to 13 m above the surface and five towboats and two barges will tow it 1.7 km away to a point where the current is much slower. It will then be transported upright on to the semi-submersible structure and taken to Mokpo. If all goes well, it should be able to reach the dock in 11 to 12 days, and another 15 days will be required to search the inside of the vessel on dry land.	1
[soliloquy id="18443″] Wyrmwood is a movie about the zombie apocalypse (as many movies are these days). It follows two main plot threads. First off, we have Barry (Jay Gallagher) who teams up with various travelers trying to survive in this new world. All the while Barry feels profound remorse and guilt over having had to put a few nails in the heads of his newly-undead wife and child. The story goes in a very Mad Max–esque direction and that os what immediately drew me into this picture. The cast gears up in sporting equipment and makeshift armor and piles into a modded out truck that uses zombies as its' fuel source (just go with it). While this is all going on, Barry's sister Brooke (Bianca Bradey) has been captured by some kind of military experiment involving zombies and a crazy scientist in a hazmat suit. As she is chained to a wall she slowly begins to develop the ability to control zombies through some sort of telepathy or telekinesis or something (again, just go with it). Here is where I take a bit of an issue. This movie seems like it's at odds with itself and confused as to what it wants to be. It feels like screenwriters Kiah Roache-Turner and Tristan Roache-Turner had two ideas for a zombie movie and instead of choosing one and running with it they tried to do both at the same time. Either story is interesting enough to carry the film, but I wish they had picked one or the other, because both of them are underdeveloped. Characters in Barry's story often get killed off before we learn anything about them and a lot of the details of the zombie fuel thing are left unexplained. Why did all of the regular gas stop working? Why are the zombies suddenly breathing and bleeding fuel? It's the same way with Brooke's story. There are vague allusions to a higher purpose, but we never really know what the military experiment was meant to accomplish. The plot raises too many questions to which we never get answers. Script issues aside, the core cast of Wyrmwood is great. Jay Gallagher steals the show as Barry, going to some real extremes over the course of the movie. He's a blast to watch as guilt turns to anger and he starts to take out his frustrations on the unsuspecting zombie population. Seriously, there are moments where he just runs right up to them and punches them in the face. Having started the movie off in a very dark place it's great to see him just let loose. Leon Bruchill's Benny plays off of Barry really well and they have some nice banter at times. Bianca Bradley as Brooke is tough as nails even before the zombie superpowers kick in. She's badass and always engaging to watch, which is impressive considering how much of the movie she spends with a muzzle on her face while she's tied to a wall. I would be remiss if I didn't mention Berryn Schwerdt as the doctor. I have no idea what his character was doing but oh man is he entertaining. This doctor is dancing to music while sticking syringes in zombies and chewing up the scenery all over his laboratory. He's an over-the-top caricature, but it really works. Kiah Roache-Turner shows some real promise in the director's chair as well. Wyrmwood can be a little rough around the edges at times, but for the most part it's a really good looking movie. There's some of the dreaded "shaky cam," but it's never done to an obnoxious degree and always serves to accent the chaos of the situation. There's definitely an eye for color here, too. Some scenes are lit in a saturated and exaggerated way while others are void of color entirely. All of this sets an interesting mood throughout the picture. Ultimately, I liked this movie. It's definitely in that "style over substance" camp, but sometimes that's enough. The script is all over the place throwing everything but the kitchen sink at you, and while that can be a little off-putting in certain regards it also makes for a hell of an experience. If they had ironed out some of the plot issues this could have been a great movie, but as it stands it's a good one. Wyrmwood is a fun and humorous adventure that doesn't take itself incredibly seriously but still manages to squeeze in some really dark and emotional moments. It's left open for a sequel so who knows… maybe we'll get the answers to those questions some day. You can check it out for yourself in select theaters and VOD February 13, 2015!

One thing I hate about being an atheist is some people would call me the devil. Yes. Me. Get a good look at the devil reincarnated people. Little old me is the devil…the minimum wage part-time cart pusher at walmart that does stand-up comedy on the side. Not the guy creating laws that doesnt' allow people of certain sexualitys to marry each other. No it's me a guy who tries his best to put other people's needs over his own. Not the corporation that cuts the funds for a program that'll feed the homeless so they can go on a vacation with the homies then later write it off as a "business trip". No it's me the guy who "awww"'s at kitten videos. Not the people who start wars because someone didn't want to share. Im going to break the logic of the people who call me the devil….I'm an atheist, I don't believe in any higher power. The devil in a way knew GOD personally…I technically can't be the devil. small rant Advertisements	1
The burned Doctors Without Borders hospital is seen after explosions in the northern Afghan city of Kunduz, on Saturday, Oct. 3, 2015. (Médecins Sans Frontières via AP) After nearly an hour of bombing on its hospital in the Afghan city of Kunduz, a Doctors Without Borders representative in Kabul received a text message from a U.S. military official in response to the group's pleas to stop the attack: "I'll do my best," said the text message from the American, who was also in Kabul. "Praying for you all." The 2:59 a.m. message is included in a log released by Doctors Without Borders on Thursday in a report on the Oct. 3 bombing of its Kunduz medical facility by the U.S. military. The first bombs from a U.S. AC-130 gunship fell between 2 a.m. and 2:08 a.m., prompting a flurry of calls from the medical organization, also known as Médecins Sans Frontières Global (MSF), for the airstrikes to stop. [Pentagon faces question: Should it make condolence payments for Taliban killed in hospital bombing?] The report was released by MSF to be transparent and counter speculation that the hospital was being used as a Taliban military base, the medical organization said. The hospital was treating Afghan civilians, Taliban fighters and civilians the night of the airstrikes, it said. The bombing came as the U.S. and Afghan militaries fought to take back the city of Kunduz, which had fallen to the Taliban a few days before. Some 30 medical staff members and patients were killed, with some burned beyond recognition. "The question remains as to whether our hospital lost protected status in the eyes of the military forces engaged in this attack — and if so, why," said Joanne Liu, MSF's international president, in a letter included with the report. "This answer does not lie within the MSF hospital. Those responsible for requesting, ordering and approving the airstrikes hold these answers." A Pentagon spokesman, Navy Capt. Jeff Davis, said Thursday that MSF shared its report with the military ahead of releasing it. Gen. John Campbell, the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan, also met with MSF leaders in Afghanistan on Wednesday, Davis added. "We continue to work closely with MSF in identifying the victims killed and wounded so we can conclude our investigations and proceed with follow-on actions, to include condolence payments. We're also committed to working with MSF to determine the full extent of the damage on the hospital so that it can be repaired in full." MSF began making calls about the airstrikes, which remain under investigation by the U.S. military, no more than 11 minutes after the first airstrikes hit the hospital, the report said. At 2:19 a.m., an MSF official called the top U.S. military headquarters in Afghanistan to say that the hospital had been hit with an airstrike, but the bombs continued to fall. [In northern Afghanistan, a mix of Taliban, foreign fighters and soldiers spread thin] MSF followed up with a 2:20 a.m. phone call to the International Committee of the Red Cross, and calls at 2:32 a.m. to a Defense Department official in Washington and a United Nations liaison in Afghanistan, the report said. As the airstrikes continued, a military official at the U.S. military headquarters in Kabul apologized in a text message at 2:52 a.m. "I'm sorry to hear that, I still do not know what happened," the text message said, according to the MSF report. The message exchange as it appears in the report follows. Resolute Support is shorthand for the headquarters by the same name, which leads U.S. military operations in Afghanistan and is near the U.S. Embassy in Kabul. OCHA CivMil is short for the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs' civil-military liaison in Afghanistan.  The humanitarian group assured the U.S. military its hospital in northern Afghanistan was not under Taliban threat just days before a deadly airstrike on the compound last month, the organization said Thursday. The group continued to push for an independent investigation into one of the deadliest civilian casualty incidents stemming from a coalition action in the Afghan conflict. The U.S. military and others are currently conducting parallel reviews into the chain of events leading to the more than hour-long attack. Campbell told The Washington Post in an interview in Kabul on Friday that the military is obligated by law to do what is known in military parlance as a 15-6 investigation, after the Army regulation that lays out the rules for investigating officers. He expects to have the initial results of that soon, but declined to be more specific with a time table. Campbell added that he does not	1
I noted earlier that Sen. John McCain has taken a strange position on the Libyan conflict: He's been calling for the ouster of Moammar Gadhafi not only on humanitarian grounds, but also because Gadhafi has "American blood on his hands" from the 1988 Lockerbie bombing. However, just 18 months ago, McCain himself traveled to Tripoli to talk to Gadhafi about a transfer of American military equipment. He also praised the "remarkable and positive turn" in U.S.-Libya relations. It turns out one of the diplomatic cables released by WikiLeaks describes in detail the friendly meeting between McCain and Gadhafi. It was also attended by fellow hawks Joe Lieberman and Lindsey Graham as well as Gadhafi's son, Muatassim. (See video of the meeting here.) Keep in mind the context for the meeting was several years of increasingly warm relations between the U.S. and Libya. In the private talks, Muatassim Gadhafi "emphasized Libya's interest in the purchase of U.S. lethal and non-lethal military equipment." McCain was receptive to that request: Muatassim requested the "highest level of help possible" to obtain military supplies, including mobile hospitals and uniforms. He also requested assistance with upgrading Libya's equipment, including helicopters. "We can get [equipment] from Russia or China, but we want to get it from you as a symbol of faith from the United States," he said. He described the security threats that Libya could possibly face as a result of its geography - "There are 60 million Algerians to the West, 80 million Egyptians to the East, we have Europe in front of us, and we face Sub-Saharan Africa with its problems to the South." ... Senator McCain assured Muatassim that the United States wanted to provide Libya with the equipment it needs for its TRIPOLI 00000677 002.2 OF 002 security. He stated that he understood Libya's requests regarding the rehabilitation of its eight C130s (ref D) and pledged to see what he could do to move things forward in Congress. He encouraged Muatassim to keep in mind the long-term perspective of bilateral security engagement and to remember that small obstacles will emerge from time to time that can be overcome. Bucky Turco at Animal New York points out that the Pentagon apparently has an expansive definition of "non-lethal equipment." The term encompasses items like shotguns, tear gas canisters and stun grenades. McCain sent out this memorable tweet after his Gadhafi meeting: There's nothing contradictory about previously advocating for normalization of relations with Gadhafi and then shifting, in the face of Gadhafi's attacks on rebels, to supporting a bombing campaign. That's not what McCain is doing. He is arguing that Ghadafi needs to be ousted because he has American blood on his hands (from 1988), when the senator himself was meeting with and praising the Libyan regime a mere 18 months ago.	1
Growing up, you read me the Ugly Duckling. And for years I believed that was me. I am a woman—that ugly duckling among men. For so long you taught me I was nothing more than a bad copy of the standard. I couldn't run as fast or lift as much. I didn't make the same money and I cried too often. I grew up in a man's world where I didn't belong. And when I couldn't be him, I wanted only to please him. I put on your makeup and wore your short skirts. I gave my life, my body, my dignity, for the cause of being pretty. I knew that no matter what I did, I was worthy only to the degree that I could please and be beautiful for my master. And so I spent my life on the cover of Cosmo and gave my body for you to sell. I was a slave, but you taught me I was free. I was your object, but you swore it was success. You taught me that my purpose in life was to be on display, to attract and be beautiful for men. You had me believe that my body was created to market your cars. And you raised me to think I was an ugly duckling. But you lied. Islam tells me I'm a swan. I'm different—it's meant to be that way. And my body, my soul, were created for something more. God says in the Qur'an: {O mankind, We created you from a single (pair) of a male and a female and made you into nations and tribes, that you may know one another (not that you may despise each other). Verily, the most honored of you in the sight of God is the one who is most righteous} (49:13) So I am honored. But it is not by my relationship to men. My value as a woman is not measured by the size of my waist or the number of men who like me. My worth as a human being is measured on a higher scale: a scale of righteousness and piety. And my purpose in life—despite what the fashion magazines say—is something more sublime than just looking good for men. And so God tells me to cover myself, to hide my beauty, and to tell the world that I'm not here to please men with my body; I'm here to please God. God elevates the dignity of a woman's body by commanding that it be respected and covered, shown only to the deserving—only to the man I marry. So to those who wish to "liberate" me, I have only one thing to say: Thanks, but no thanks. I'm not here to be on display. And my body is not for public consumption. I will not be reduced to an object or a pair of legs to sell shoes. I'm a soul, a mind, a servant of God. My worth is defined by the beauty of my soul, my heart, my moral character. So I won't worship your beauty standards, and I don't submit to your fashion sense. My submission is to something higher. With my veil I put my faith on display—rather than my beauty. My value as a human is defined by my relationship with God, not by my looks. So I cover the irrelevant. And when you look at me, you don't see a body. You view me only for what I am: a servant of my Creator. So you see, as a Muslim woman, I've been liberated from a silent kind of bondage. I don't answer to the slaves of God on earth. I answer to their King.	1
Attention owners of unmanned aerial vehicles (aka, drones) interested in filming orcas off the coast of Washington: keep your distance. That's the message being sent by officials from the state's Department of Fish and Wildlife after ticketing two drone pilots $1,025 each for getting too close to a pod of killer whales. According to KIROTV in Seattle, the two pilots were fined in separate incidents on Aug. 16 involving an aerial drone within 10 yards of a pod of orcas. Under Washington state law, no vessel or object of any manner is permitted within 200 yards " of a southern resident orca whale." Exceptions are made for authorized scientific research, federal vessels and rescue operations. One of the men fined, Douglas Shih of Aerial Photography Seattle, told the station that he never intended to "hurt or distract" the orcas. He later uploaded a video of the offense to YouTube. In a first-of-its-kind study released earlier this month, scientists flew drones to within 33 feet of bears tagged with heart sensors. While the bears didn't act bothered by the drones, their heart rates went up significantly — with one bear's heart rate leaping from 39 to 162 beats a minute. The news comes as conservation organizations all over the world are leveraging drones to help monitor and protect endangered species. "I don't doubt that these bears, that many species, could habituate to UAVs," study leader Mark Ditmer told NatGeo. "But if you have an endangered species or animals sensitive to human interference, we could push them beyond a threshold. If in the future there are lots of UAVs out there, acute stress could become more chronic. And that can lead to a lot of problems." Drone pilots filming orcas fined $1K each for flying too close Fish and Wildlife officers hand out the stiff penalties based on federal protections for killer whales.	1
Due to the fierce competition in the online shopping world, one of the common questions we're asked by clients, is how they can keep control of product pricing. After all, when you sell to a distributor or to a retailer you're selling at a discounted rate. The price resellers pay is determined mostly by your MSRP (Manufacturer Suggest Retail Price). But once they've paid, they can then sell at whatever price they deem profitable to them. So if your MSRP is $50.00 and you sell to a retailer at 50% discount, they have the potential to make $25.00 profit. But if they're willing to make less they can undercut the competition. When this happens, and the price war kicks in, your MSRP goes out the window and your phone starts to ring off the hook with complaints from resellers. Usually it's the brick and mortar stores complaining about the cutthroat pricing the online players are offering. But it can be other online resellers complaining too. The solution (or rather prevention) is MAP When we're working with new companies and we're discussing pricing strategy and sales channels - we always bring up their reseller agreements. It can be a dicey conversation, since many eager entrepreneurs will take any order, and don't want to potentially complicate sales with legal agreements. However, the smartest will listen and can understand how implementing reseller agreements from the start will circumvent problems (such as price wars and reseller disputes) later. Reseller agreements can be complicated things and its definitely a document you'll need legal counsel to do right. But virtually all of them should stipulate that the reseller agrees to a minimum advertised price. So what exactly is MAP? A minimum advertised price is just that - it's the agreed price a reseller agrees to advertise a brand or product at. There may be some wiggle room, but generally, when a reseller accepts the agreement, they're stuck. They can't advertise a product for sale any less than the agreed price. This means in print, online, or any where. Of course, this doesn't mean they can't sell the product cheaper, they simply can't display a cheaper price. And well, if the lower price isn't shown, it's hard to discover it. MAP does not equal price fixing While collusion to maintain a fixed price or profit margin is illegal in most circumstances MAP policies are legitimate and valid - if done correctly. First, and here's the big differentiator - MAP pricing does not limit the actual selling price. It simply sets the minimum price a product can be advertised at - whether that's in print or online. Apple computer is a perfect example of this policy. It's rare that you'll see any sale or larger discounting on Apple products - regardless of the size of the reseller. Apple controls their displayed pricing in two ways. First, their reseller agreements certainly dictate MAP price points - and secondly, they offer slimmer than normal margins to their channels - the later reduces the incentive to discount heavily. They also strictly control the inventory levels dolled out to resellers - to prevent steep discounting or clearance pricing. In fact, one of the few times you'll ever see bargain pricing on Apple products is when a retailer has decided to discontinue selling Apple. But because they're usually not sitting on a large stock pile of inventory, this rarely happens. Why would a reseller accept MAP? Resellers are adverse to risk. They certainly don't want to take on new brands and products that they'll be undercut on by other resellers. They want to have some cost control and profit assurances. MAP affords them some protection. They know that if they buy your product to sell, they won't necessarily see it online tomorrow advertised for way less. Likewise, generally, by accepting MAP the reseller will gain something in return. And this is the important motivator. It may be co-op advertising dollars. It may be exclusivity or specific territories. Or it could simply be better wholesale pricing. What about eBay and Amazon? Of course, the "right of first sale doctrine" and the abundance of steep discount offers means you'll always find "deals" online. Steeply discounted products that don't adhere to your MAP - and probably don't have to. For instance, if you or a reseller, offer a promotional discount, perhaps buy one get one free (BOGO) - you'll get savvy shoppers that scoop up these deals and then resell the products at a discount. And since they're working with virtually no overhead, they may be willing to live on a few dollars of profit. Our advice to clients in this area is usually two-fold. First, limit or at least monitor these types of sales and promotional offers. If you make such an offer and a customer suddenly orders dozens of them, there's a good chance they'll be on eBay in the	1
Even as Congress has begun the process to repeal Obamacare, Americans continue to seek coverage through its insurance exchanges. More than 11.5 million people have signed up for coverage through the federal marketplace, healthcare.gov, and the 12 state-based exchanges, as of Dec. 24, according to federal data released Tuesday. That's 286,000 more than the comparable time a year ago. The number of people opting for Obamacare is under more scrutiny than usual this year, since President-elect Trump and Congressional Republicans have vowed to repeal it soon after he takes office on Jan. 20. Initial efforts, however, are already running into resistance, with some GOP members wanting to wait until a replacement plan is ready before voting to repeal. Though the Trump administration takes control late next week, current Health & Human Services officials laid out a plan to further boost sign ups through Jan. 31, which marks the end of open enrollment. The agency is airing television and radio ads, sending targeted emails to potential customers and reaching out via YouTube and other social media channels -- continuing outreach efforts that have been underway during this enrollment season. The Internal Revenue Service is also contacting those who paid a penalty for remaining uninsured. The agency recently announced that about 6.5 million Americans had to pay the penalty, typically $330, in 2015. That's less than the roughly 8 million who were penalized in 2014. High on the list of targets is younger Americans, who typically are healthier and have lower health care expenses. However, they still make up only 26% of those signing up on the federal exchange to date, the same as last year. It's unclear whether the marketing efforts will continue under Trump, who has vowed to repeal President Obama's signature health reform law. Still, Obama and his officials continue to make a case for Obamacare. "In access, quality and affordability, the Affordable Care Act has helped us make real progress for families across the nation," said Health Secretary Sylvia Burwell on Monday. The Obama administration expects a total of 13.8 million people to sign up for plans by the end of the enrollment period, which began Nov. 1. However, it's common for people to drop their policies during the course of the year because they find coverage elsewhere, either through a job or a spouse. So, an average of 11.4 million people are expected to be in Obamacare policies during 2017. Consumers aren't officially enrolled until they pay their first month's premium. Related: GOP worried about Obamacare plan Even before the election, there were concerns that prospective enrollees would be deterred by price hikes -- the average premium for the benchmark silver plan soared 22% for 2017 -- and the fact that some insurers had pulled out of the exchanges. Most enrollees, however, are shielded from those increases by federal subsidies. Some 82% of people who have signed up for 2017 plans are eligible for subsidies, according to Health & Human Services Department officials. The average subsidy for those enrolling on the federal exchange is $4,600 a year. Consumers are also shopping around for coverage. Some 56% of returning customers actively selected plan, up from 51% a year ago. Those who opt not to shop are automatically re-enrolled in their existing policy.	1
LendingClub, a company that provides an online loan marketplace, has filed an S-1 document to raise up to $500 million in its initial public offering. The San Francisco-based LendingClub, as with many technology companies currently seeking the public markets, has quickly growing revenues but isn't profitable. The company had net revenue of $86.94 million in the first half of 2014, up from $37.09 million in the year-ago period. The cost of that revenue growth swung LendingClub from profit to loss. In The first half of 2013, LendingClub had net income of $1.74 million. In the same period this year, the company lost $16.49 million. The company's sales and marketing costs jumped from $16.12 million to $39.81 million when comparing the first half of 2013 and the first half of 2014. LendingClub doesn't loan out its own capital and collects fees of loans that are originated on its platform from both individuals and more sophisticated investors alike. The more loans that pass through its network, the more money that LendingClub nets without putting more immediate risk onto its books — a neat mechanism. According to the S-1, LendingClub receives between 1 percent and 6 percent of the principal amount of loaned monies. Also, LendingClub charges investors a small percent — around 1, but variable — management fee, and takes a roughly 1 percent servicing fee on transacted payments. According to CrunchBase, LendingClub has previously raised $392.9 million in venture capital over the course of 12 rounds — the company's most recent capital infusion, $65 million, touched down in April of this year. LendingClub reported cash of just under $67 million in its S-1 document. LendingClub's loan volume has quickly grown. The company indicates that it has "facilitated" over $5 billion in loans since its birth in 2007. $1 billion of that tally occurred in the second quarter of 2014, implying rapid expansion of demand for its services. According to the filing, loan volume increased by 125 percent from the first half of 2013 to the first half of 2014. The company's preliminary S-1 doesn't indicate what its ticker symbol will be, or what exchange it will list on. The document does indicate that the company intends to execute its offering this year. LendingClub's IPO could set a benchmark for other companies that have growing revenues and cost structures that lead to GAAP losses.	1
A Chinese man growing poppies on the roof garden of his home to produce opium for making drugs for his own use was caught by police after he posted videos of the white flowers on his social media account, mainland media reports. The unnamed man from Mojiang county in the southwestern province of Yunnan, uploaded videos of 163 poppy plants he was growing using his smartphone, the China News Service reported. However, planting and cultivating the plant is prohibited on the mainland without a licence. A policeman checking posts on the internet spotted the videos last week, which led to officers visiting the man's home. All 163 poppy plants have been removed. After being questioned by police, the man said he had been ill for a long time and had been growing the poppies for the seeds to produce opium, for making drugs for his own use. Opium is used in creating morphine, which is used in medicines and as a recreational drug. The man said he was unaware that growing these plants was illegal. Mainland law states that a person that has unlawfully planted fewer than 500 poppy plants, but which does not lead to a serious crime, can be fined up to 500 yuan (HK$600), or placed in detention for up to five days. The report did not give details about the man's likely punishment.	1
Is Harley-Davidson's venerable Panhead the best looking motorcycle engine of all time? It's certainly up there with the Triumph and Moto Guzzi twins. It's nearly half a century since the last Panhead rolled off the production line, but its appeal has never waned. It's a hit with both customizers and restorers, so we're spoilt for choice with this Top 5. The 'Pan' was the mainstay of Milwaukee's production from 1948 until the mid 60s. It fixed many of the problems that afflicted its predecessor, the Knuckle, with oil-tight aluminum heads and chrome-plated rocker covers. For some folks, the Pan has never been bettered. You can even buy a lookalike motor from S&S: It's designed to slot into a post-1970 Harley chassis and will cost you a cool $8,000. For this round-up, though, we're focusing on custom Panheads that keep the retro vibe but crank up the style. The kind of bike you might want to take out early on a Sunday morning for a leisurely ride, letting the torque do the talking.  WRECKED METALS Matt Whitlock builds hot rods as well as motorcycles. An eye for a line seems to come with that territory, and Matt's 1959 Panhead is super-clean. It's running a rebuilt motor boosted to 93 ci and a 4-speed 'box with suicide shift. The heavy-set looks of a stock Pan have gone, thanks to a rigid frame, a Springer front end and straight-shootin' custom pipes. Matt fabricated the narrow bars, foot controls and rear fender himself, giving the Harley a timeless, classic look. [More about this bike | Wrecked Metals] Image (and top image] by Dylan and Sara.  MATT MACHINE Australian Matt Darwon has a double life. By day he's an award-winning architect, and by night (okay, by weekend) he's a world-class bike builder. He focuses on twins, whether Moto Guzzi, Ducati or Harley, and rides his bikes hard along the highways and backroads of New South Wales. He built this 1950 Pan for a friend, meticulously re-welding the frame and then grafting on a Kawasaki tank and Yamaha rear fender. An S&S Super E carb gives the engine a useful power boost and Matt made the pipes himself. Believe it or not, he also applied the intricate paint job. Is there no end to this guy's talents? [More about this bike | Matt Machine]  NOISE CYCLES Scott Jones is a true original, and this is one of the most original custom Panheads out there. It's an 88ci 1952 EL model that won 'Best In Show' at Born Free, thanks to offbeat styling and remarkable craftsmanship. Jones cut his teeth working for Jesse James and then Ian Barry of Falcon Motorcycles, so he knows his stuff. In this case, that stuff includes a hand-fabricated aluminum tank, a drum brake from a Yamaha racebike, and a smattering of custom-machined components, including the triple trees. Fine work from a builder at the top of his game. [More about this bike | Noise Cycles] Image by Jose Gallina.  CUSTOMS FROM JAMESVILLE There's more to the Danish custom scene than the Wrenchmonkees. Denmark is also home to James Roper-Caldbeck, an Englishman who specializes in rebuilding vintage Harleys. In Europe, word has spread far and wide about his skills, and this 1948 Pan was commissioned by a Romanian enthusiast living in Germany. The need to pass strict German legislation resulted in a low-key build, but it still oozes style—from the Springer front end to the rear fender, which was crafted from a 1930 Ford spare wheel carrier. In between is a thoroughly overhauled and reconfigured machine, with neat touches like cloth-covered wiring and a subtly cut-and-shut tank. [More about this bike | Customs From Jamesville]  LOWBROW CUSTOMS Tyler Malinky of Lowbrow Customs is usually associated with the Brit chopper scene, but he can turn out a killer Harley when he wants to. This 'garage-built' Panhead caught the attention of virtually every custom magazine in the States last year; it's not a radical build, but it's beautifully proportioned and finished. Tyler cleaned up the frame, TIG welded any blemishes, and fitted a rigid rear section, a stretched neck and Triumph forks. After installing Amal carbs (yes, really), Malinky used a modified Bates taillight to supply the finishing touch. This Panhead is one of those bikes that just looks 'right.'

When you think of Elder Scrolls and questing you immediately go into the exploration mode. Turn and run off in a random direction and you are guaranteed to find some lost ruin or dungeon. However, even the great RPG behemoth known as Skyrim has directions and quests to move the player through multiple story lines. Elder Scrolls Online has a similar approach. The team wanted to add in exploration to the zones and the game, but hey also have quests in to guide players through the zone pick up some valuable loot at low levels and to tell an overall story. We wanted to talk a little about how questing works in the game and what players can expect. advertisement advertisement We got to play Daggerfall with the demo this past week. The opening zone has a quest line where you are helping some pirates put together a crew to get off this island under the thumb of an evil warlord. I don't want to give the story away, so that is all you get in terms of spoilers. There is a main quest line to find three crew members around the island and reunite them with the captain. Quests begin with cutaways to the character talking directly to you on screen. It is easy to get through and you can talk as much or as little as you want. Like any Elder Scrolls game you are given dialogue choices. You can get the main theme of the quest and say goodbye, or you can continue with more information during the conversation. I will admit that I am not a huge fan of cut scenes, however in Elder Scrolls Online they are not intrusive. The game does not center around the dialogue and you can still get the quest information and move on quickly. You can also get more information on the quests if you want to continue chatting through all of the options. As you move through the zones there are a lot of quest areas that open up to you. Everything is very clearly marked on your map so it is easy to navigate. As you enter one of the areas in the main quest you will see other quests pop up in the zone to finish if you want. One of the journalists at the demo only did the main quest line and quickly moved to the next zone. I continued to find smaller quests that I wanted to do and pursued those instead. It took me longer to get through the zone, but I am also the completionist sort of player. So the big question is what happens if you do not really "pick up" quests? There are fail safes built into the zones so that you will move through the content and get to the next areas. This is not as big a deal once you get out of the starter zone. The other important thing I noticed is that there are no "kill ten rats" quests at all, at least not in the starting zone. The quest lines are more centered around story and not about grinding some arbitrary number. Overall, it has more of an RPG feel than many MMOs do. There is another very important element in Elder Scrolls Online questing: how you accomplish your goals. The team feels very strongly about giving you multiple ways to achieve your quest objectives. On one hand you are given a disguise to wear and travel through a pirate camp. This allows you to avoid all of the fights along the way. If you are more of a bash 'em style player you can just charge in and fight your way through the camp. You can also sneak around the NPCs to reach your objectives. There were multiple ways to get the quests done throughout the entire opening zone. I know the team is all about this dynamic and it is great for the players. At one point I was fighting everything I saw in the camp. Then I had to run back through to complete a quest and I did not want to have to fight so I put on the disguise. It made it much easier to move quickly. Having multiple options to complete your goals is definitely one of the best parts of questing in ESO. At MMORPG.com we have talked a lot about quest design. I think one thing that Elder Scrolls gets right is that you do not feel like you're just grinding quests, at least not early on. It really does capture the RPG feeling of games like Skyrim where you can pick multiple paths, go on different adventures and you never feel like you are in a hamster wheel. The question will be how it plays out at higher levels, and whether the developers will run out of ways to keep things interesting for the PVE adventurers among us.	1
You need the Real Audio player to hear this which you can download for free . If it still doesn't work try this link . Most people have heard of Murphy's Law. But most people, when they're referring to Murphy's Law, are actually referring to the rather pessimistic Finagle's Law, which is "Anything that can go wrong, will go wrong." Murphy's Law is quite different, and is actually a message of hope. Not only does it warn you about what things can go wrong, it'll even tell you how you can work around them, so as to make it impossible for Murphy's Law to actually happen. Now the AeroSpace industry, where things move very rapidly under very harsh and extreme conditions, is an unforgiving environment. And that's where Murphy's Law was first invented. In 1949, the US Air Force was running a test series (Project MX981) to see what sort of acceleration (or G-forces) a human being could withstand. They were using a volunteer strapped into a rocket sled at what is now called Edward's Air Force Base, in California. The sled would accelerate up to about 1,000 kilometres per hour, and then stop suddenly. One of the volunteer human torpedoes was Colonel Stapp, who was also a medical doctor. Now our hero, Air Force Captain Edward A. Murphy Jnr., had designed a harness which strapped onto the volunteer. This harness held 16 sensors to measure the acceleration, or the G-forces, on different parts of the poor volunteer. As luck would have it, there were two ways that each sensor could be installed. The rocket sled took off, and stopped suddenly, generating 40 Gs. Under 1 G, the average person weighs about 70 kg, but under 40 Gs, they weigh 40 times more - about 2.8 tonnes. 40 Gs is an enormous amount of acceleration - enough to push your ears onto the front of your head. At the end of the experiment Colonel Stapp staggered off the rocket sled with blood-shot eyes and bleeds from a number of bodily orifices. When he looked at the results, he wasn't very happy - all the sensors registered zero! He called for Captain Murphy, who examined the sled - and found that every single one of those 16 sensors had been installed the wrong way round. Colonel Stapp had been strained in vain. In a voice like thunder, Edward A. Murphy Jnr. proclaimed, "If there are two or more ways to do something and one of those results in a catastrophe, then someone will do it that way". This is the true and original form of Murphy's Law. Of course, you have to notice that little word, "If" in "If there are two or more ways......". Suppose that there's only one way. For example, if you design something that can be installed only one way, then it can't be put in the wrong way. Consider 240 V electrical power. You definitely don't want the full 240V power to jump directly to any of the other wires. So look at your standard 3-pin 240V electrical power plug. It's not symmetrical. There's only one way to insert it into a 240V electrical power socket. But sometimes, it doesn't matter which way a thing goes in, so long as it goes in. So another way around Murphy's Law is to design something so that it doesn't matter which way it goes in. Consider the key. Your average car key has equal bumps on both sides, so it doesn't matter whether you put it in one way or the other - it always works. But your house key has bumps only on one side - this means that half the time, you'll put it in the wrong way. I guess it's an example of Murphy's Law that after half a century after Murphy's Law was first discovered, the house key manufacturers still haven't heard of it. So once he had realised the message of Murphy's Law, Murphy himself redesigned the G-force sensors so that they could be installed only one way - and that particular problem was solved. The next day Murphy's Law was officially declared at a Press Conference about the rocket sled test. A few months later Murphy's Law began to be mentioned in AeroSpace manufacturer's advertisements, and finally by the Flight Safety Foundation. As Murphy's Law spread across the planet, two things happened - people forgot that there was a real person called Murphy, and the Law got modified into the pessimistic form of "If anything can go wrong, it will go wrong". The fact that many people confuse the optimistic Murphy's Law for the pessimistic Finagle's Law, is proof that Murphy's Law can even act upon itself.	1

Persona 4: Dancing All Night Producer Shares The Latest Details By Sato . February 16, 2015 . 4:09am Recently, Persona 4: Dancing All Night's official website was updated, and producer Kazuhisa Wada answered some fan questions in a Q&A session on the game's blog. Here are some of the details Game Jouhou put together from his answers. There are plans for a downloadable version. No plans for a demo, but there are plans for an event where the game will be demoed. The gameplay is basically the kind where you have notes appear from the middle of the screen, and go towards one of the six areas, and you time your button or D-pad presses accordingly. Similar to other rhythm games, there are multiple presses, long holds, and "scratch" elements. The game is also compatible to touch functions. A tutorial and play demonstration video is expected to be revealed soon. The difficulties are Easy, Normal, Hard, and All Night. In story mode, you'll get to make it even easier. Persona 4: Dancing All Night is a rhythm game with a story. It takes place several days after the very end of Persona 4 Golden.More details on that will be revealed later on. Each character has multiple costumes, a part that Atlus put a lot of effort into. There are plans for costume and song DLCs. Things will be put in motion after seeing how fans react. There will be a mode to look at character models. There's a main dance mode called "Free Dance" that will unlock more songs as you play along. There are rewards for achieving full-combos for the tracks. Nanako plays a big role in the game's story, and will dance, but she won't participate in the battles we'll see in the story. Persona 4: Dancing All Night will be compatible with the PlayStation TV. Hanako Ohtani won't dance. Persona 4: Dancing All Night releases in Japan on June 25, 2015 for PlayStation Vita.	1
Could they have gotten into an argument over religion? Police wouldn't say if the Bible was found open or closed, but its presence so close to the body leaves one to wonder. A local detective refused to fill in any of the many blank holes in the story of Freddy Akoa's death. "I can't go into any of the details," Detective Rich Vogel of the Portland Police Department told WND. "I'm just not at liberty to give out any information about a case that's subject to an ongoing investigation. Eventually the whole story will come out. It always does."	1
American Gods has added more old gods to its cast. EW has learned exclusively that Orlando Jones and Demore Barnes have joined the ensemble of Starz's hotly-anticipated fantasy series American Gods, based on the cult classic novel by Neil Gaiman. Bryan Fuller and Michael Green are adapting the book into series and serving as showrunners. Jones (Sleepy Hollow) will play Mr. Nancy on the show, one of the gods Shadow meets — and, arguably, befriends — during his visit to the House on the Rock, a.k.a. the American landmark where the gods assemble. Nancy is the human form of the West African trickster god Anansi, who is classically depicted as a spider and has a penchant for telling stories. (He's got a great one about a Tiger and a Monkey, if you ever need him to warm up a crowd.) Mr. Nancy is also the eponymous character in Gaiman's American Gods spin-off follow-up, Anansi Boys, which follows his two sons. As for Barnes, who previously starred on 12 Monkeys, he's set to play Mr. Ibis, "the keeper of stories, past and present, and he recounts them with great relish." Mr. Ibis runs a funeral parlor, is fascinated with death, and briefly takes Shadow under his wing. American Gods tells the story of an ex-con named Shadow (Ricky Whittle) who gets released from prison and, thanks to the mysterious Mr. Wednesday (Ian McShane), finds himself caught up in a war of worship between old, immigrant gods whose power has diminished over generations and America's new deities of technology and consumerism. As the show enters its fourth episode of production, the ensemble has shaped up incredibly well, given fan reaction already. Jones and Barnes join a cast that includes recently announced Gillian Anderson as Media; Emily Browning as Laura Moon; Pablo Schreiber as Mad Sweeney; Yetide Badaki as Bilquis; Cloris Leachman as Zorya Vechernyaya; Peter Stormare as Czernobog; Bruce Langley and Crispin Glover as the Technical Boy and Mr. World, respectively; Mousa Kraish as the Jinn; Chris Obi as Mr. Jacquel; and Jonathan Tucker as Low Key Lyesmith. The series premieres on Starz in 2017, with David Slade directing the pilot, written by Fuller and Green.	1
Your first name Former New Hampshire Gov. John Sununu had some strong words about the recent Russia investigation for CNN on Tuesday. Sununu appeared on "New Day" where he and Alisyn Camerota got into it right away. WATCH: Camerota said that Sununu should be gravely concerned if there was any collusion between the Trump administration and Russian government officials. "I don't see any evidence of collusion, do you?" asked Sununu. He followed up by saying that the lack of evidence should end the media's reporting on the subject. Sununu also believes that anything that would have been found against Trump or his staff, would have already been uncovered. "You're seven months into the investigation," Sununu said. Camerota came back and said that the governor's point was unfair and that the real investigation was just beginning. To which the governor replied frankly, "How much crow are you going to eat?"

Review: Neon Indian, 'VEGA INTL. Night School' Note: NPR's audio for First Listens comes down after the album is released. However, you can still listen with the band's full-album video at the bottom of the page. Enlarge this image Courtesy of the artist Courtesy of the artist "Hey there, sexy," a saucy voice says on a hotline set up to promote Neon Indian's new album, in a sort of send-up of phone-sex festivity. Dial the number (512-643-VEGA) and, after sitting through a few lascivious intimations, a link gets sent by way of text to hear the new single from VEGA INTL. Night School. It's very Neon Indian: old and new technologies coming together in a sly but seemingly sincere way, with throwback results that keep the prospect of a party in mind. "Slumlord," the song triggered by the phone call, is big and bright in a manner that peers back to Neon Indian's chillwave roots but with a newer — and bigger and brighter — sense of scale. The beat is thwacking and spacious, its disco ambiance aided by a bulbous bassline and a gaggle of synthesizers in arpeggiated action. There's a lot going on, and its antic metabolism carries over to much of the album, Neon Indian's third since breaking out in 2009 and its first since 2011's Era Extraña. After a brief, roiling electronic intro, "Annie" kicks off the album in earnest with a laid-back quasi-reggae vibe that evokes contemporaries like Peaking Lights as well as throwbacks from The English Beat to Men At Work. The sleek, colorful electronic tinge of it all makes for a sound far better than the notion of "quasi-reggae" might suggest, and it introduces '80s-mining inclinations that are never too distant in the mix. "Street Level" follows in the style of a strange, sloshing pop song that seems to have more sounds clamoring within it than any one song could contain, before "Smut!" clears out a bit in favor of an airier, more leisurely groove. The vocals of Neon Indian chief Alan Palomo sound smeary and diaphanous throughout, with occasional falsetto rises that tip toward Prince but more often strike a wandering tone that favors suggestive impressions of feelings more than clear words. ("Neoprene" and "magazine" figure in "Smut!" in a way that seems significant.) Within the mix of so many other animated sounds at play, the voice takes its place as just another presence at a party worth crashing. Neon Indian has also created a psychedelic video for the entire album. The visuals were created by Sabrina Ratté:	1
There are two ways to support Buddhism. One is known as amisapuja, supporting through material offerings. These are the four supports of food, clothing, shelter and medicine. The act of amisapuja supports Buddhism by giving material offerings to the sangha of monks and nuns, enabling them to live in reasonable comfort for the practice of dhamma. This fosters the direct realization of the Buddha's teaching, in turn bringing continued prosperity to the Buddhist religion. Buddhism can be likened to a tree. A tree has roots, a trunk, branches, twigs, and leaves. The leaves and branches depend on the roots to absorb nutriment from the soil. The words we speak are like branches and leaves, which depend on a root—the mind—to absorb nutriment and send it out to them. These limbs in turn carry the fruit as our speech and actions. Whatever state the mind is in, skillful or unskillful, it expresses that quality outwardly through our actions and speech. Therefore the support of Buddhism through the practical application of the teachings is the most important kind of support. For example, in the ceremony of taking the precepts on observance days, the teacher describes those unskillful actions that should be avoided. But if you simply go through the ceremony of taking the precepts without reflecting on their meaning, progress is difficult. You will be unable to find the true practice. The real support of Buddhism must therefore be done through patipattipuja, the "offering" of practice, cultivating true restraint, concentration and wisdom. Then you will know what Buddhism is all about. If you don't understand through practice, you'll never know, even if you learn the whole Tipitaka. In the time of the Buddha there was a monk known as Tuccho Pothila. This monk was one of the Buddha's most learned disciples, thoroughly versed in the scriptures and texts. He was so famous that he was revered by people everywhere and had eighteen monasteries under his care. When people heard the name " Tuccho Pothila" they were awestruck, and nobody would dare question anything he taught, so much did they revere his command of the teachings. One day he went to pay respects to the Buddha. As he was paying his respects, the Buddha said, "Ah, hello, Venerable Empty Scripture!" Just like that! They conversed for a while until it was time to go, and then, as he was taking leave of the Buddha, the Buddha said, "Oh, leaving now, Venerable Empty Scripture?" That was what the Buddha said. On arriving, "Oh, hello, Venerable Empty Scripture." When it was time to go, "Ah, leaving now, Venerable Empty Scripture?" That was the teaching the Buddha gave. Tuccho Pothila was puzzled, "Why did the Buddha say that? What did he mean?" He thought and thought, turning over everything he had learned, until eventually he realized, "It's true ! 'Venerable Empty Scripture'—that's me, a monk who studies but doesn't practice." When he looked into his heart he saw that really he was no different from lay people. Whatever they aspired to, he also aspired to; whatever they enjoyed, he also enjoyed. There was no real samana within him, no truly profound quality capable of firmly establishing him in the Noble Way and providing true peace. So he decided to practice. But there was nowhere for him to go to. All the teachers around were his own students. No one would dare accept him. Usually when people meet their teacher they become timid and deferential, and so no one would dare to become his teacher. Finally he went to see a certain young novice who was enlightened and asked to practice under him. The novice said, "Yes, sure you can practice with me, but only if you're sincere. If you're not sincere then I won't accept you." Tuccho Pothila pledged himself as a student of the novice. The novice then told him to put on all his robes. Now there happened to be a muddy bog nearby. When Tuccho Pothila had carefully put on all his robes—expensive ones they were, too—the novice said, "Okay, now run down into that bog. If I don't tell you to stop, don't stop. If I don't tell you to come out, don't come out. Okay…run!" Tuccho Pothila, neatly robed, plunged into the bog. The novice didn't tell him to stop until he was completely covered in mud. Finally the novice said, "You can stop now." So he stopped. "Okay, come on up!" And he came out. Clearly Tuccho Pothila had given up his pride. He was ready to accept the teaching. If	1

The science of Santa: Mr Claus will eat 150 BILLION calories and visit 5,556 houses per SECOND this Christmas Eve  Fun infographic attempts to explain the science behind Santa and his elves Based on population figures, Santa will deliver gifts to 1.6 billion children This requires visiting 5,556 homes a second and eating 150 billion calories Each child needs 80cm of wrapping, which would stretch 1.5 million miles  the total number of presents would set Santa back £279.27 billion With young children inevitably set to ask a barrage of questions about Santa this Christmas, a team of scientists have created a fun guide that attempts to at least answer a selection of them. It was created by the founders of The Big Bang UK Young Scientists and Engineers Fair who teamed up with economists from the Centre for Economics and Business Research (CEBR). They worked out that, based on official population figures, there are 1.6 billion children worldwide set to be visited by Santa this year.  Using official global population figures, the Big Bang UK Young Scientists and Engineers Fair and the Centre for Economics and Business Research have attempted to calculate the science of Santa, pictured left. They worked out that 1.6 billion children will need presents globally this year THE SCIENCE OF SANTA CLAUS Based on population figures, Santa will deliver gifts to 1.6 billion children. This requires visiting 5,556 homes a second and eating 150 billion calories in milk and mince pies. With an average of 2.5 children per household, Santa will need to make 640 million stops on Christmas Eve. Each child needs 80cm of wrapping, which would stretch 1.5 million miles. The total number of presents would set Santa back £279.27 billion. Prior to the big night, Santa needs to store all these presents in a warehouse. Assuming each present average out at 0.008 m3, the warehouse would need to cover the same space as 240,000 double-decker buses. But thanks to the different time zones and the rotation of the Earth, Santa does have 32 hours to work with.  The researchers estimated that Santa will therefore have to visit 5,556 homes every second on Christmas Eve to make sure every child gets a gift.  With an average of 2.5 children per household, Santa will need to make 640 million stops on Christmas Eve.  If he eats milk and mince pies at each of these addresses, he will consume a total of 150 billion calories in just one night - 60,000 times his daily recommended intake. Assuming each of the 640 homes he visits gives him a 200ml glass of semi-skimmed milk and one mince pie, Santa will have drunk almost 130 million litres of milk by the time he's finished his deliveries - enough to fill over 50 Olympic swimming pools. He will also have eaten nearly 40,000 metric tonnes worth of mince pies. To work off this extra weight, Santa would need to walk 1.3 billion miles, which is 54,000 times around the circumference of the earth. According to the Big Bang Fair, Santa's elves will use 80cm of wrapping paper for each child, which would stretch 1.5 million miles and the total number of presents would set Santa back £279.27 billion. He would also need to store these presents in a warehouse that covers the same space as 240,000 double-decker busses The Big Bang experts assume each elf can wrap a present in exactly 10 seconds and at that speed wrapping two presents for every child would require 3,000 elves to work eight hours every day for an entire year to get the job done. Furthermore, if Santa gave two presents to each child the elves would need to use an average of 80cm of wrapping paper for each gift – which works out at a staggering 1.6 million miles of paper. If two metres of wrapping paper costs Santa 99p, this will cost a total of £1.27 billion.  Based on these calculations, Christmas gifts will cost Santa £279.27 billion this year - £30 billion more than the GDP of his home country of Finland. That would be enough to go around the world 60 times and is more than six times the distance between the Earth and the Moon. The researchers estimated that Santa will have to visit 5,556 homes every second this Christmas Eve to make sure every child gets a gift. If he eats milk and mince pies at each of these addresses, he will consume a total of 150 billion calories in just one night - 60,000 times his daily recommended intake Prior to the big night, Santa would need to store all these presents in a warehouse, and assuming each present averages out at 0.008 m3, the warehouse would need to cover the same space as 240,000 double-decker busses.

CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuelan police crushed and chopped up nearly 2,000 shotguns and pistols in a Caracas city square on Wednesday, as the new interior minister relaunched a long-stalled gun control campaign in one of the world's most crime-ridden countries. Venezuelan National Guard destroy a weapon during an exercise to disable seized weapons in Caracas, Venezuela, August 17, 2016. REUTERS/Marco Bello Interior Minister Nestor Reverol said the event marked the renewal of efforts to disarm Venezuelans, through a combination of seizures and a voluntary program to swap guns for electrical goods. A police officer hammers a pistol during an exercise to destroy seized weapons in Caracas, Venezuela August 17, 2016. REUTERS/Marco Bello Venezuela has the world's second highest murder rate and the street gangs that plague its poor neighborhoods have become increasingly heavily armed in recent years, at a time when a deep recession has reduced resources available to police. Gangs often get weapons from the police, either by stealing them or buying them from corrupt officers, experts say. With inflation of 185 percent in 2015 and a currency collapse, police salaries have fallen far behind rising prices creating more incentives for corruption. Slideshow (5 Images) President Nicolas Maduro promoted Reverol this month, days after the United States accused the former anti-drugs tsar of taking bribes from cocaine traffickers. "We are going to bring disarmament and peace," Reverol told reporters, while police officers drilled and sawed at rusty shotguns, home made pistols and some newer weapons. Other guns were crushed in truck-mounted presses. Some members of the public watched, although more danced to a nearby sound system playing salsa music. Venezuela has also bought laser technology to mark ammunition, Reverol said, in an attempt to keep a registry of the bullets given out to the South American nation's many state and municipal police forces. Experts say that much of the ammunition used in crimes in Venezuela is made at the country's government munitions factory and sold on by corrupt police.	1
Earlier today, President Obama held a press conference to address the growing public concern over the National Security Agency's surveillance practices. We are glad to see that the Administration has been forced to address the matter publicly as a result of the sustained public pressure from concerned voters as well as the ongoing press coverage of this issue. Obama acknowledged that Americans were uncomfortable with the surveillance that has been leaked to the media (and noted that he would be as well, if he weren't in the government). He made four commitments to transparency and reform during the press conference, and also published a whitepaper describing the legal interpretation of the PATRIOT Act that is used to attempt to justify bulk surveillance. While we're glad Obama is responding to the public's concerns, we take Obama's promises today with a healthy dose of skepticism. He may be paying lip service to accountability and transparency, but the devil will be in the details when it comes to whether his proposals will be effective. Other promises aside, President Obama did not commit to reducing the surveillance of Americans' communications or the communications of individuals abroad who are not suspected of any crime. Obama's 4 Commitments – And What's Missing Obama made 4 specific commitments around NSA surveillance. Here's an overview of what he did – and did not – promise to do. 1. Obama will work with Congress to "pursue appropriate reforms to Section 215 of the Patriot Act." This is the subsection of law used to justify the bulk collection of telephone records. Several bills have been introduced this Congress that attempt to tighten up this law, and we're glad to see Obama will be supportive of such efforts. However, Obama pointedly did not address Sec. 702, the other statute that the government has cited as supporting its broader surveillance, including the content of communications. And as we've explained, to return Americans to the rule of law and privacy and free speech rights that they deserve, we'll need changes well beyond Section 215 of the PATRIOT Act. And even as to 215, Obama failed to explain what "appropriate reforms" might look like. Read what EFF thinks should be in NSA reform legislation. 2. Obama will work with Congress to improve public confidence in the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) by creating a public advocate that can defend privacy in the court. We were pleased that Obama specifically promised "to make sure civil liberties concerns have an independent voice, in appropriate cases, by ensuring that the government's position is challenged by an adversary" in the extremely secretive FISC. This could be a powerful reform, and one we would wholeheartedly support (especially, for example, if organizations like EFF can serve as the adversary on occasion). However, whether this is actually implemented in a meaningful way remains to be seen. A public advocate in the FISC should be involved in every proceeding, not just "in appropriate cases." Furthermore, that advocate would need full access to the materials the government will be using in presenting its case to the judge. And finally, we remain concerned that this position will be subject to capture unless it has at least the sort of independence and protections that public defenders enjoy. 3. Obama has directed the intelligence community "to make public as much information about these programs as possible." First, "these programs" must include "all surveillance programs," not just those that have been leaked so far. The NSA is supposed to put in place a full time civil liberties and privacy officer and create a website that details its surveillance practices. This should have happened long ago, though we think this is a step in the right direction. However, any such website must actually provide real answers about surveillance rather than obfuscations and word games. 4. Obama is creating a "high level group of outside experts to review our entire intelligence and communications technologies." This group will be tasked with creating an interim report in 60 days and a final report by the end of the year that should address the impact of surveillance technologies, including potential abuses as well as the impact on foreign policy. We're not certain whether Obama is planning on having the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board fulfill this role or whether he is planning on creating a new board, but it is very clear that any group of experts will struggle to have independence, adequate subpoena power, resources and staff time, as well as the political clout necessary to have a meaningful impact on our current surveillance regime. We hope that Obama ensures that this expert board has the information it needs to do its job. While we were skeptical about other aspects of the press conference, we were pleased to see Obama acknowledge the benefits of privacy enhancing technology. He stated that "[T]echnology itself may provide us some additional safeguards. So for example, if people don't have confidence that the law, the checks and balances of the court and Congress, are sufficient to give us confidence that government's not snooping, well, maybe we can embed technologies in there that prevent the snooping regardless of what government wants to do. I mean, there may be some technological	1

Every year careless hackers, cyberstalkers and others are undone by the digital trails they leave behind for law enforcement to collect and trace back to them. But who would have thought the nation's top spy chief would be undone so easily by digital footprints left behind in e-mail? In the irony of ironies, thedistinguished career of CIA Director and former Afghanistan war commander David Petraeusappears to have come unhinged after authorities traced the location of the sender of threatening e-mails that were written from an anonymous e-mail account and sent to a woman in Florida. Authorities say the location data connected to the e-mails and the e-mail account from which they were sent, helped them identify the sender as Petraeus' biographer, Paula Broadwell. This helped them search other e-mail accounts owned by Broadwell, including a Gmail account she used, which led them to the affair with Petraeus, according to The Wall Street Journal. The case shows just how easy it is to discover the personal connections that can unmask anonymous parties. But the Petraeus affair is as much an outlier as an exemplar. The FBI rarely, if ever, gets involved when one person is harassing another online. "I'm not aware of any case when the FBI has gotten involved in a case of online harassment," Justin Patchin, an associate professor of criminal justice at the University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire, said. "The FBI definitely wouldn't get involved in your Joe Schmoe love triangle." The affair began to unravel after the Florida woman, Jill Kelley, contacted an FBI friend after receiving threatening and harassing e-mails from an anonymous person who accused her of flirting with a man who was not identified in the e-mails. Kelley is a volunteer social planner for events at MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa, Florida, which is home to the military's Central Command. Petraeus was commander of CENTCOM from 2008 to 2010, when he left to take his position as head of the CIA.The e-mails, between 5 and 10 of them, began arriving last May, and reportedly told Kelley to "back off" and "stay away" from the unnamed man. Kelley's FBI friend launched an investigation to determine if the threatening e-mails constituted a cybercrime. FBI investigators determined that the anonymous account from which the e-mails were sent belonged to Broadwell and her husband, who live in North Carolina. Reports are unclear about how they did this, but, according to the New York Times investigators were able to determine what other e-mail accounts had been accessed from the same computer address as the one that sent the harassing e-mails, which may have led them to Broadwell or her husband. The information contained in the metadata of e-mail headers varies. It's unclear if the anonymous account was a Gmail account or came from another e-mail service provider. In Gmail, the header generally only includes the IP address and domains of the servers through which the e-mail was sent, as well as ones it passed through in transit to the recipient's inbox. Authorities would have had to contact Google to obtain information about the IP address that was used to log into the anonymous account and any other accounts that were accessed from the same address. But other e-mail providers, such as Yahoo, do include the sender IP address in the metadata. Agents considered that the anonymous e-mail account used to send the harassing e-mails might have been hacked by someone else who was sending the e-mails to Kelley. But they eventually were able to match the locations from which the e-mails were sent to the same locations, including hotels, where Broadwell was known to have been during the times the correspondence was set to Kelley, according to the Journal. Based on these connections, investigators obtained a warrant to monitor other e-mail accounts Broadwell used, including a Gmail account. In examining these other accounts, agents uncovered sexually explicit e-mails that Broadwell exchanged with another party who also used a Gmail account. Investigators were not able to immediately identify Petraeus as the other party, however, because he'd set up his Gmail account using a pseudonym. Investigators determined sometime during mid-summer that it belonged to Petraeus and that the two were having an affair. The reports do not say how investigators made that connection. According to the New York Times it's not known if the FBI gained access to Petraeus' personal e-mail account, or if its investigation relied solely on e-mails found in Broadwell's account. Broadwell's affair with Petraeus reportedly began two months after he took over the CIA and ended about four months ago, around the same time the FBI discovered the affair, according to Col. Steven Boylan, who spoke to ABC News. After the FBI contacted Broadwell the week of Oct. 21, she acknowledged the affair and provided authorities with her computer. The agents discovered several classified	1
Although some Quakers were slaveholders, members of that religious group were among the earliest to protest the African slave trade, the perpetual bondage of its captives, and the practice of separating enslaved family members by sale to different masters. As the nineteenth century progressed, many abolitionists united to form numerous antislavery societies. These groups sent petitions with thousands of signatures to Congress, held abolition meetings and conferences, boycotted products made with slave labor, printed mountains of literature, and gave innumerable speeches for their cause. Individual abolitionists sometimes advocated violent means for bringing slavery to an end. Although black and white abolitionists often worked together, by the 1840s they differed in philosophy and method. While many white abolitionists focused only on slavery, black Americans tended to couple anti-slavery activities with demands for racial equality and justice.	1

The beginning of wrestling from the arms. [96v] Der anfall vsz den Armen zu ringen. They have peasant-clinched with one arm below and the other above and lie in the striving. In the striving, so he slips his head through his arm and pulls him up. [97r] Die habent birlichs gefasst ain Arm vnden den anndern oben vnd ligend In dem streb. In dem Streb So schlefft er sin hopt durch sin Arm vnd zuckt In vff. As he has clinched from the arms. So he thrusts with his right elbow on his right arm and with the thrust so he grips him below his right foot and pulls him up and throws him over. He has it not good. He will throw him over the shank. [97v] Als der gefaszt hatt vsz den Armen So stoszt der mit sinem Rechten Elbogen vff sinen Rechten arm vnd mit dem stosz So gryfft er Im vnder sinen rechten fusz vnd zuckt In vff vnd wirfft In über vssz. Der hutt es nit gutt. Der wyl den werffen vber den schenckel. Here he will bring him into trapping if he might break the arm. Here he has brought his arm on the shoulder and will break it off. [98r] Hie wyl der den bringen In Trapen ob er Im möcht Brechen den Arm. Hie hatt der Im den arm Bracht vff die achsel vnd wöllen Im den abbrechen. From the clinch, so he throws him over the shank. Here he has stepped behind and thrust him over the shank. [98v] Vsz dem Fasen So würfft er In vber den Schenckel. Hie hatt er In hinder Tretten vnd Stosst In über den schenckel. Yet an equal peasant clinch. From the peasant clinch, so he pulls the lower arm and grips him by the head and swings him from him. [99r] Aber ain glichs Byrlichs Fasen.

(Amy King/The Washington Post; iStock) Melinda Gates, the philanthropist and mother of three, gathered from listening to her kids and their friends that the next generation of American spouses expects to evenly split the household chores. "I'm sorry to say this, but if you think that, you're wrong," she wrote to high schoolers Monday in her annual open letter, co-penned with her husband Bill Gates. "Unless things change, girls today will spend hundreds of thousands more hours than boys doing unpaid work simply because society assumes it's their responsibility." She backed her case with global data. Women worldwide devote an average of 4.5 hours each day to unpaid work — cooking, cleaning, changing the baby's diaper. Men contribute less than half that much time, according to the OECD. The domestic division of labor remains staggeringly unbalanced in the United States, where female breadwinners now support 40 percent of homes. Women here typically spend two hours and 12 minutes daily on housework, while men spend one hour and 21 minutes. [The best age to get married if you don't want to get divorced] A 2015 survey by Working Mom, furthermore, found that female breadwinners who lived with male partners still reported handling the bulk of grocery shopping, meal preparation, bill-paying and cleaning. "This isn't a global plot by men to oppress women," Melinda wrote. "It's more subtle than that. The division of work depends on cultural norms, and we call them norms because they seem normal — so normal that many of us don't notice the assumptions we're making. But your generation can notice them — and keep pointing them out until the world pays attention." (Bill, it should be noted, drives their kids to school every other day.) Melinda is right about cultural norms in America and beyond. Even after moms could vote and become chief executives and run for president, dads maintained their status as primary provider status in popular culture. Consider Fusion's new breakdown of the Oscar-winning actresses through the years: Most have played wives. The wife penalty Of course, that's a highly simplified explanation for why one sex shoulders more unpaid work. And it's not to say all women feel trapped in motherhood and the associated duties. But, as Gates points out, for women who want to excel in their careers, the disproportionate load can create an unfair penalty. Men, it turns out, might be holding their partners back when they don't share non-work tasks. Mothers in the United States who work full time, year round, make an average of $40,000, compared to $56,999 paid to fathers, according to the National Women's Law Center. That's 70 cents to the dollar. Economists say this disparity probably comes from a blend of factors: Women are sometimes "mommy tracked," or passed over for high-profile projects or promotions, when employers assume motherhood (but not fatherhood) zaps productivity. A 2015 study from the University of Georgia found that, for this reason, expectant mothers are often afraid to tell their bosses they're pregnant. Women do take more time off to tend to family, but that's not always a choice. Sometimes, as the data shows, husbands just don't pull their domestic weight. They also tend to prioritize their careers over their wives', while wives tend to equally prioritize both partners' careers, according to a 2014 study of 25,000 Harvard Business School graduates. The lesbian wage premium Evidence for the wife (or husband) penalty shows up in what researchers call the "lesbian wage premium." Across years of research, women who have never lived with a male partner make more money than women who have. Last year, Marieka Klawitter, professor of public policy at the University of Washington, examined 29 studies across the Western Hemisphere on wages and sexual orientation and found a 9 percent earnings premium for lesbians over heterosexual women. (Gay men, meanwhile, faced an 11 percent penalty, compared to straight men.) She controlled for parenthood and concluded lesbians simply had more education and work experience than the general female population. [The U.S. is still divided on what causes homosexuality] But another study from the University of Nevada, which used national data from the year 2000, adds a stunning asterisk to Klawitter's findings: Lesbians who had previously lived with male partners made 9.5 percent less than those who'd never cohabitated with a husband figure. Were men actually the drags on women's earnings? After controlling for characteristics like education and experience, the authors found a 6.6 percent premium for cohabiting lesbians over cohabiting heterosexual women, with the premium falling to 5.2 percent if the lesbians had ever been married to a man. (Still, two-women	1
I got chatting with a bloke on Waikiki Beach recently. A Collingwood supporter who wanted to talk about the state of the game. 'Roosy,' he said, 'what do you see as the biggest problems facing footy, and how would you fix them?' I didn't go to Hawaii to talk about footy. But this got me thinking. About all the meetings I'd been in with AFL executives like Adrian Anderson, Andrew Demetriou and Gillon McLachlan during my years as a coach. About so many conversations focused on the integrity of the competition. What I believed then I'm even more convinced of now: that footy's integrity is compromised. The first thing we need to do is to leave the rules alone. There's been too much tinkering and too much change. So let's just take a deep breath, let the rules settle, and leave the game as is for the next year four or five years, until the next broadcast deal starts in 2023. The game itself is in really good shape. It's even, because the equalisation mechanisms are kicking in after years of compromised drafts. It's good to watch, and thankfully no-one's talking about flooding now, or stoppages. So leave it be – and, while we're at it, keep the interchange system as it is and the Grand Final on Saturday afternoon, too. But there are problems. There are five issues compromising the AFL that have been bubbling for years, some for decades, and there's also a relative newcomer to the debate: the need to deal with concussion and its ramifications so that the game's welfare keeps pace with the players. DRAW EQUALITY The draw's not fair. We all know it. You could be playing the five bottom teams twice. You could be playing the five top teams twice. I don't subscribe to the 17-5 model that's been mooted, I think it's ridiculous, so what is the fairest draw model for the integrity of the competition? What's fairest is that you play everyone twice, home and away, but you're never going to have a 34-week season. So what's the next best option? The players obviously want to spend less time at clubs, and I actually spoke to a high-profile player last year when I was coaching Melbourne and I said, 'Would you take less money if there was only 17 rounds?' He said, 'Yeah, I would'. So, 17 rounds. Play each other once: home one year and away the other. Two byes stretch it to 19 weeks, and instead of the pre-finals week off I would have a 'wildcard' play-off round where it's seven-versus-ten and eight-versus-nine. So the bottom eight are finished, teams one to six get the week off, and then, bang, you go into the finals series of eight as we know it. But there are problems. There are five issues compromising the AFL that have been bubbling for years, some for decades. That stretches the season for the broadcasters, gives the players the two byes they want, gives the top six an extra bye, but also gives the 10th placed team a sneaky chance to play finals. There will be issues with broadcasters and that's why it needs to happen at the end of the current TV rights deal – clearly there's obstacles around how you'd get it done. But one of the biggest impediments to our game now is it started off as 12 teams playing each other twice, so 22 rounds. In an 18-team competition, there are soft draws and hard draws and we need a fairer, more equitable system. How resistant will the AFL's broadcast partners be, given that they're tipping in more than $2 billion over six years for what they get now? If they're paying what they're paying now, then they're going to want 23 rounds, but if they're saying, 'Well, we'll pay less', and the players say, 'Well, we'll take less', who knows? Clearly there's some issues around it, but I'd love to think that the powers-that-be can sit down and work it out, because the fixture won't be fair until they do. RAISE THE DRAFT AGE This is one I've been very strong about, for multiple reasons. Probably the main one is when kids are doing Year 12 we shouldn't be asking them to do under 18 championships, TAC Cup, club football, school football, and their final year of school all at the same time. Then suddenly you might be on the plane to Perth when you've lived in Ballarat and your Mum and Dad have looked after you and your whole life's been relocated. I think the minimum draft age needs to be at least a year older. As it is, the gap that	1
Disclaimer Before I start, let me make a few things very clear. I believe hitting a woman is a despicable act, as a husband, I can't imagine a situation where I would do so, and as a father, I would absolutely destroy any "man" who put his hands on my 4-year-old daughter, or my son if he ever even had the thought of doing so to any woman. I believe that our justice system was designed around a single premise: that everyone is "innocent until proven guilty" ... however, that through time, there are certain acts, like domestic violence, where our societal views have begun to default immediately to guilt, and place the burden of proof, unfairly, on the accused. We view many of these types of cases as black-and-white, open-and-shut. ... Casting these individuals as horrible human beings who don't deserve to breathe, and the only picture of "justice" involves them paying mightily for their actions. I believe that there are certain situations in which those feelings inevitably influence the actions of those in law enforcement as well as the judicial system. ... Thus bringing about the importance of a trial by jury, and unanimous verdicts. Certain people, including Dallas' own Dale Hansen of WFAA Channel 8 have adopted the view that Hardy is without a doubt, guilty, and Mr. Hansen declared so in his statements regarding the Dallas Cowboys this week. ( Our complete coverage of Hardy/Cowboys angles is collected here.)  Hansen's "unplugged'' piece from Wednesday is seen above. His Thursday roundtable featuring our own Mike Fisher is here.  The purpose of this piece is not to declare Greg Hardy to be innocent or guilty of the actions of which he was accused; it is simply to provide as true a picture as possible of the events that took place, their context, and their aftermath, to allow you (the reader) to come to your own conclusion. Background Hardy came into the NFL with questions about his off-field behavior, after being suspended for two games by the University of Mississippi for missing meetings and breaking team rules, and even kicked off the team before being reinstated. However, Tyrone Nix, Hardy's defensive coordinator at Ole Miss told the Charlotte Observer that Hardy never had any incidence involving violence towards women in his time there, and that he "has always been a guy of high character, as far as respect to others." Prior to the incident in question, Hardy's criminal record consisted only of traffic violations, including speeding, on operator's license (waived), window-tinting violation (waived), and driving without registration (waived). Hardy and the alleged victim, Nicole Holder, entered a romantic relationship in September 2013, the start of Hardy's finest year of professional football, while Holder was employed as a waitress at a Charlotte nightclub. They remained in a relationship which a friend of Holder described as "really good, really bad, with nothing in between" until they broke up in February 2014, although they did stay in contact and occasionally engage intimately. After the couple split, Holder entered a brief relationship with the rapper Nelly, which had upset Hardy, but by the time of the incident in question, they were trying to "reconcile the relationship." On May 10, 2014, two nights before the incident in question, Holder was seen following Hardy out of her place of employment, The Epicenter nightclub in Charlotte, crying and blocking his car from leaving. Security guards involved the police after Holder kicked the door of Hardy's car. The night of the incident The night of May 12, 2014, Hardy, and Holder, along with Hardy's assistant and other friends, went out drinking. Holder later admitted to snorting cocaine that night, although a co-worker enacted her Fifth Amendment rights when asked about taking cocaine with Holder that night. After a night of partying, including Hardy getting upset when a Nelly song was played in one of the clubs they visited, they returned to Hardy's apartment and continued to party. The 9-1-1 Calls: At approximately 4:18 a.m., Hardy made a call to 9-1-1, in which he stated the following: That Holder had hit him in the face twice, and wouldn't leave the apartment, and that she told him to break her arm when he asked her to leave. Hardy's assistant was trying to retain her but she was attempting to his Hardy with a shoe. Hardy stated that she wouldn't let him close the door to the apartment and that he "can't touch her to get her out". That he was trying to stay away from her, and that he was behind the bar, and wasn't touching her, but that she had broken some glass and he couldn't walk through his kitchen. Additionally he repeatedly asked "What do I do?" When asked if he needed a medic he stated that he was "a little swollen" but didn't notice	1

F1 driver penalty points: Who has picked up most sanctions in 2016? Stewards' investigations into incidents between drivers on track and other misdemeanours have become increasingly commonplace in F1, with different totting-up procedures in place to deter repeat offenders. With the 2016 season entering its final races, we take a look at how the tables for driver penalty points and reprimands stands… Driver penalty points Since 2014, F1 has had a penalty points system in place akin to the one used on roads to punish driving offences. Any driver who accrues 12 points on their superlicence over a rolling 12-month period receives a one-race ban. Points are wiped when the year anniversary of the respective offence is reached. No driver has yet reached the 12-point limit. Haas driver Esteban Gutierrez leads the table after the Japanese GP with seven points, five of which were collected in the space of just three races either side of the summer break. The Mexican picked up three at Spa for blocking Pascal Wehrlein on the 200mph Kemmel Straight. Sebastian Vettel runs into Nico Rosberg at the start of the Malaysia GP. Sebastian Vettel runs into Nico Rosberg at the start of the Malaysia GP. Championship leader Nico Rosberg is next up with six after being found at fault for collisions with Lewis Hamilton (Austria), Max Verstappen (Germany) and Kimi Raikkonen (Malaysia). Despite not having a reputation as one of the sport's more aggressive drivers, Valtteri Bottas also has collected six points, as has Sauber's Felipe Nasr. The F1 drivers' half-term report Lewis Hamilton is one of five drivers with a clean licence, while Max Verstappen has not added any extra points to his record in 2016 despite a string of high-profile wheel-to-wheel battles. Verstappen accrued a record eight points in his debut F1 campaign last season, but just three now remain on his licence from Abu Dhabi last November with the Red Bull driver successfully steering clear of trouble with the stewards so far in 2016. F1 driver penalty points (after 2016 Japanese GP) Points Driver Next points dropped 7 Esteban Gutierrez May 1, 2017 (2 points) 6 Valtteri Bottas November 13, 2016 (2 points) Felipe Nasr November 14, 2016 (2 points) Nico Rosberg July 3, 2017 (2 points) 5 Daniil Kvyat May 1, 2017 (3 points) 4 Carlos Sainz May 1, 2017 (2 points) Pascal Wehrlein May 29, 2017 (4 points) Sebastian Vettel July 10, 2017 (2 points) Rio Haryanto March 19, 2017 (2 points) 3 Max Verstappen November 29, 2016 (3 points) Sergio Perez September 17, 2017 (3 points) 2 Fernando Alonso November 29, 2016 (2 points) Nico Hulkenberg April 17, 2017 (2 points) Kevin Magnussen May 15, 2017 (2 points) Marcus Ericsson May 29, 2017 (2 points) Kimi Raikkonen June 19, 2017 (2 points) Jolyon Palmer July 2, 2017 (2 points) Esteban Ocon September 18, 2017 (2 points) 0 Lewis Hamilton, Daniel Ricciardo, Romain Grosjean, Felipe Massa, Jenson Button Driver reprimands Although Hamilton has no penalty points to his name, the world champion jointly leads the way for reprimands after the season's opening 17 rounds - leaving him one away from a grid penalty. Reprimands are usually issued by stewards for more minor infringements and a 10-place grid drop is applied if a driver receives three of them during any one season, provided two were meted out for driving offences. Hamilton's two reprimands both fall into this category. In Bahrain he was punished for briefly reversing in the pit lane after qualifying, while in Russia he was warned about not rejoining the track in the correct manner during practice. The world championship leader, who took a big grid penalty after the summer break for exceeding engine elements, is therefore one more reprimand of any kind away from a costly 10-place drop. Toro Rosso's Carlos Sainz is the only other driver on two reprimands for the season.	1
Dr John Bates' disclosures about the manipulation of data behind the so-called 'Pausebuster' paper is the biggest scientific scandal since 'Climategate' in 2009 when, as Britain's Daily Mail reported, thousands of leaked emails revealed scientists were trying to block access to data, and using a 'trick' to conceal embarrassing flaws in their claims about global warming. Britain's Mail on Sunday today revealed astonishing evidence that the organisation that is the world's leading source of climate data rushed to publish a landmark paper that exaggerated global warming and was timed to influence the historic Paris Agreement on climate change. A high-level whistleblower has told this newspaper that America's National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) breached its own rules on scientific integrity when it published the sensational but flawed report, aimed at making the maximum possible impact on world leaders including Barack Obama and David Cameron at the UN climate conference in Paris in 2015. The report claimed that the 'pause' or 'slowdown' in global warming in the period since 1998 – revealed by UN scientists in 2013 – never existed, and that world temperatures had been rising faster than scientists expected. Launched by NOAA with a public relations fanfare, it was splashed across the world's media, and cited repeatedly by politicians and policy makers. But the whistleblower, Dr John Bates, a top NOAA scientist with an impeccable reputation, has shown The Mail on Sunday irrefutable evidence that the paper was based on misleading, 'unverified' data. It was never subjected to NOAA's rigorous internal evaluation process – which Dr Bates devised. His vehement objections to the publication of the faulty data were overridden by his NOAA superiors in what he describes as a 'blatant attempt to intensify the impact' of what became known as the Pausebuster paper. In an exclusive interview, Dr Bates accused the lead author of the paper, Thomas Karl, who was until last year director of the NOAA section that produces climate data – the National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) – of 'insisting on decisions and scientific choices that maximised warming and minimised documentation… in an effort to discredit the notion of a global warming pause, rushed so that he could time publication to influence national and international deliberations on climate policy'. The scandal has disturbing echoes of the 'Climategate' affair which broke shortly before the UN climate summit in 2009, when the leak of thousands of emails between climate scientists suggested they had manipulated and hidden data. Some were British experts at the influential Climatic Research Unit at the University of East Anglia. His disclosures are likely to stiffen President Trump's determination to enact his pledges to reverse his predecessor's 'green' policies, and to withdraw from the Paris deal – so triggering an intense political row. As The Mail continues, whatever takes its place, said Dr Bates, "there needs to be a fundamental change to the way NOAA deals with data so that people can check and validate scientific results. I'm hoping that this will be a wake-up call to the climate science community – a signal that we have to put in place processes to make sure this kind of crap doesn't happen again. "I want to address the systemic problems. I don't care whether modifications to the datasets make temperatures go up or down. But I want the observations to speak for themselves, and for that, there needs to be a new emphasis that ethical standards must be maintained." He said he decided to speak out after seeing reports in papers including the Washington Post and Forbes magazine claiming that scientists feared the Trump administration would fail to maintain and preserve NOAA's climate records. Dr Bates said: "How ironic it is that there is now this idea that Trump is going to trash climate data, when key decisions were earlier taken by someone whose responsibility it was to maintain its integrity – and failed." NOAA not only failed, but it effectively mounted a cover-up when challenged over its data. After the paper was published, the US House of Representatives Science Committee launched an inquiry into its Pausebuster claims. NOAA refused to comply with subpoenas demanding internal emails from the committee chairman, the Texas Republican Lamar Smith, and falsely claimed that no one had raised concerns about the paper internally. Last night Mr Smith thanked Dr Bates "for courageously stepping forward to tell the truth about NOAA's senior officials playing fast and loose with the data in order to meet a politically predetermined conclusion". He added: "The Karl study used flawed data, was rushed to publication in an effort to support the President's climate change agenda, and ignored NOAA's own standards for scientific study." Professor Curry, now the president of the Climate Forecast Applications Network, said last night: 'Large adjustments to the raw data, and substantial changes in successive dataset versions, imply substantial uncertainties.' It was time, she said, that politicians and policymakers took these uncertainties on board. Read more here...	1

Taylor Valley is one the McMurdo Dry Valleys. The landscape is composed of expanses of a sandy, gravelly soil, ice-covered lakes (at right), and glaciers flowing from the local mountains (center background). Credit: Andrew Fountain New research led by Portland State University glacier scientist Andrew Fountain reveals how a single warming event in Antarctica may be an indication of future ecosystem changes. In the scientific paper, "The Impact of a Large-scale Climate Event on Antarctic Ecosystem Processes," published in a special section Thursday in Bioscience, Fountain and his team detail the climate event and summarize the cascading ecological consequences over the last 15 years caused by a single season of intense melting in Antarctica between 2001 and 2002. "What we saw in the Antarctic summer of 2001 and 2002 could be the Antarctic future in the decades to come," said Fountain, the study's lead author. "What was an otherwise unchanging environment could be on the cusp of very dramatic changes." Stationed in East Antarctica's McMurdo Dry Valleys—a polar desert that's among the driest places on Earth—Fountain and his research team studied the effects of massive flooding caused by the glaciers that melted when air temperatures suddenly warmed to 39 degrees Fahrenheit. Flooding streams eroded, lake ice thinned, lake levels rose, and water reached new places across the barren landscape. The ecosystem still responded to this event after five or more years. Scientists suspect these events will appear more frequently in the future as climate warming affects Antarctica. Fountain's research was conducted in tandem with another National Science Foundation-funded site, Palmer Station, on the West Antarctic Peninsula, a vastly different Antarctic landscape. The extreme climate shift at Palmer during 2001 and 2002 caused freezing and melting at the edge of the peninsula, resulting in increased algal bloom and Antarctic krill, a devastating decline in the population of Adelie penguins, and an increase in the populations of gentoo and chinstrap penguins.

Buzz Axe Bombardier Take the wrath of the hot potato! Character Krieg Type Gamechanger Tier 3 Maximum Points 1 Skill Tree Bloodlust Minimum Level 16 Effect When thrown, your buzz axe now has Dynamite attached to it which explodes on impact. Game Borderlands 2 Buzz Axe Bombardier is a tier 3 skill in Krieg's Bloodlust skill tree. When thrown during Buzz Axe Rampage, Krieg's buzz axe will explode as soon as it makes contact with a surface. During Buzz Axe Rampage, Krieg's buzz axe will have a bundle of lit dynamite attached to the end. Effects Adds explosive damage equal to the base damage of the thrown buzz axe.[1] Special Skill Text Axe go Boom! Notes When points are invested in both Fire Fiend and Buzz Axe Bombardier, the thrown buzz axe will both explode and have a chance to light enemies on fire. When a point is invested in this skill, the buzz axe is treated as a grenade. Because of this it will trigger the skill Blood Bath and counts towards grenade associated challenges. Buzz Axe Bombardier can be extremely powerful when combined with Strip the Flesh, and class mods that increase explosive damage. The impact radius of the explosion is actually quite large. This means Krieg does not actually need to hit an enemy to damage them with this ability, making a thrown buzz axe much more effective against fast or small targets. The explosion can damage Krieg himself when the impact location is too close.	1
The new England kit has the OTP seal of approval. Now let's remember when the kit designers didn't get it so right!  1. England third shirt, 1992 Umbro seemingly replaced the Three Lions by breeding a sunflower with an iguana and letting the resulting offspring crawl over this third shirt.  2. England away shirt, 1996 England's summer of 1996 was going fantastically well until this splash of typical English grey put a dampener on proceedings.  3. England goalkeeper away shirt, 1996 The battleship grey outfield kit might get all the retrospective attention, but we should not overlook the accompanying monstrosity of a goalkeeper shirt being worn by David Seaman on that fateful day.  4. England home shirt, 2008 This bland effort sort of merges with the previous kit (with the St George's cross on the shoulder) in the brain. There is nothing special or distinct about it. Just boring.  5. England third shirt, 1990 Very much of its time, this England third shirt was (perhaps wisely) only worn once. It is not clear whether the opposition were mesmerised by the magic eye-style pattern.  6. England goalkeeper shirt, 1988 England were about as fashionable as they were successful at Euro 1988. The pinnacle of their brief and tasteless appearance at the tournament was Peter Shilton's lovely jersey.  7. England away shirt, 1998 And a decade on, Umbro were still getting it wrong. This shiny effort features a patchwork of cheap looking St George's crosses.  8. England away shirt, 2007 The current away kit was perfectly paired with the old home kit (number 4) since they were equally dull. The response to the away-kit-by-numbers training ground chic is one of the likely reasons for the change of direction for the new home kit.  9. England goalkeeper shirt, 1993 Come on. Own up: who's been vomiting Umbro logos?  10. England home shirt, 2005 I know this shirt is well-loved in some quarters, but I suspect that is because Umbro were seen to be listening to people who thought the England shirt needed a St George's cross on it. I don't think the history books will look back so fondly on this pretty dull effort.	1
Anyone who's read this blog knows my opinion of Mike Adams, the proprietor of the quack website known as NaturalNews.com. It is not favorable, to put it mildly. All you have to do to realize that is to type his name into the search box of this blog and see what comes up: Anger at his attacks on celebrities who have died of cancer; mockery of his pretending to be a scientist and attacking Jimmy Kimmel for "hate speech" about vaccines; alarm at his threats delivered with somewhat plausible deniability against scientists; further alarm at his "natural biopreparedness" and homeopathy for Ebola; and, of course amusement at his New World Order conspiracy mongering. In terms of blog fodder, Adams is the gift that keeps on giving. Unfortunately, in terms of his influence against science and medicine and for pseudoscience and quackery, his influence is not insubstantial, so much so that when the opportunity presents itself I feel obligated to discuss him.  The opportunity has presented itself in the form of an excellent summation of the empire of pseudoscience and quackery that is Mike Adams by Sacha Feinman entitled Meet The Internet Entrepreneur Profiting Off The Anti-Vaxxer Movement. Of course, I have one quibble about this title. Adams profits off of way more than the antivaccine movement. Quackery, fear mongering about food, Scientology-like hatred of psychiatry to the point where after the Sandy Hook school massacre, he immediately blamed psychiatric medications for the rampage of Adam Lanza, the perpetrator of the massacre. But that's just a quibble. The article itself tells the tale quite well. It also confirms something I've been writing for quite a while now, namely how Adams got his quacky start selling Y2K scams: Towards the turn of the millennium, the Y2K bug was much on the mind of the media, representing perhaps the first great conspiracy of the digital age. True believers held that the seemingly simple switchover from 12/31/99 to 1/1/00 would cause computers and electronic systems the world over to crash, triggering international crises of every conceivable sort. Adams saw the opportunity in the situation, and began to sell supposed "information products" that would insulate his paying audience from the oncoming chaos, which, of course, never came. In a since-deleted excerpt on Adams' site published by ZDNet, Adams boasted that in 1999, "in an effort to fine-tune his web marketing techniques, Michael [Adams] launched a six-month experiment to determine what kind of revenues are possible when combining his proprietary techniques and technologies with a high-awareness topic. The result? With the help of only one employee, he created a subscriber base of over 50,000 people and sold over $400,000 worth of information products while offering an open-ended, 100% moneyback [sic] guarantee." This subscriber base was largely won over by Adams' then infamous "39 Unanswered Questions about Y2K." In a foreshadowing of the sorts of the "listicles" that would drive traffic to both Natural News and the site's advertisers (not to mention BuzzFeed), Adams demonstrated a remarkable ability to frame a controversial issue in a manner perfectly suited for digital consumption. The widely shared email consisted of a series of fear-mongering questions such as, "Why is there not a single Fortune 1000 firm that has said, in its 10-Q SEC statement, that it is fully, unequivocally Y2K-compliant?" Critics panned the listicle as, "a national spamming campaign against the press and politicians to stir up enough anxiety to clear the shelves of Y2K supplies" and, "the best publicity stunt I've seen." So from the beginning, Adams was talented. He saw the possibilities in web marketing to drive traffic to his sites and use that to monetize them very early on, and to monetize them selling scams. In this, we can see him honing his early techniques. Indeed, he took it far beyond just that, mastering the dark arts of using "black hat" search engine optimization, running link farms, and using those skills to drive traffic back to his site. It turns out that the skill set that made Adams so talented at crafting mass e-mail marketing campaigns that actually persuaded the marks to give up their money is the same skill set that he later honed to become an expert at SEO. But how successful has he been? According to Feinman: According to the service comScore, Natural News hosted over 2 million unique visitors in the month of December 2014. The website's Google PageRank is a respectable six, the same number enjoyed by other, more mainstream preachers of the "natural" space. The CEO of Whole Foods John Mackey's blog also receives a six, as do the landing pages for Andrew Weil and Deepak Chopra. Adams claims that he has, "	1

How do we accept the truth? What ingredients are necessary for a person to change their most treasured beliefs if these beliefs are actually erroneous? Here we will review the "four essentials" for accepting truth. All four of these qualities are indispensable. If even one is missing or lacking, it will be extremely difficult for a person to accept and embrace reality. Let us review each one in turn: 1. Intelligence First, in order to accept the truth, a person must utilize their inherent intelligence. This includes the ability to use logic, reason, and intuition to understand a complex problem—often called critical thinking. Many people lose their critical thinking skills when they are subjectively biased toward their own paradigm or worldview. Critical thinking is important because it allows a person to think objectively, rather than subjectively, and is an essential step for actually learning the truth. The moment we cease to think critically, we cease to intelligently engage in disciplined thought that is clear, rational, open-minded, and informed by evidence. A great hindrance to learning truth occurs when we already have our conclusions formed before even examining the evidence. This happens when people think, for instance, "I know this is true, so I will refuse to look at any evidence to the contrary until I find something that might substantiate my already-determined beliefs." Thinking in this way does not allow a person to learn or progress in the direction of truth. In reality, our thinking should be the other way around. One should form conclusions after weighing all the evidence, rather than ignoring most of the evidence and searching until one can find some small piece of evidence to support an already drawn conclusion. Sherlock Holmes aptly described this situation when he said, "It is a capital mistake to theorize before one has data. Insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit theories, instead of theories to suit facts" (Arthur Conan Doyle, A Scandal in Bohemia). 2. Truth Second, in order to accept truth, a person must have access to true information regarding the church's actual history, origins, and doctrines. Many people are unaware of what actually happened when our church began and during the intervening years since then. They are exposed only to the church's version of its history, which unfortunately is highly romanticized and inaccurate. As a result, they are "only kept from the truth because they know not where to find it" (D&C 123:12). Still other people are afraid to look at the actual true history because they have been taught all their lives that any negative information about the church is "of the adversary" or "poison for the soul." Perhaps such people do not realize that "the truth stands boldly and unafraid; it is not shaken by the testing; For truth, if it be truth, arises from each testing stronger, more secure. Those that would silence doubt are filled with fear" (Robert Weston). Only error fears investigation. If you are being instructed not to investigate something, then there is probably something being hidden that you deserve to know. Along with this second essential is included the incentive and personal drive to study the true information and validate its sources. Many people, upon discovering the truth regarding our church, find themselves absorbed in months and months of fascinating study. Because a whole new world of information has been opened to their view, they acquire an insatiable desire to learn the truth. This desire and thirst for truth is crucial for anyone who wishes to acquire wisdom and live a life of integrity. It is important that each person arrives at their own conclusion based upon their personal study and critical thinking. Perhaps you have heard the story of a young man who approached the great thinker, Aristotle, and asked him the profound question: "How can I have wisdom?" Aristotle smiled and replied, "Follow me." The young man followed closely as they made their way into a pool of water. Aristotle suddenly turned and pushed the young man under the water. The student flailed with his arms, but to no avail. Aristotle was the stronger of the two, and he held the struggling lad's head beneath the surface. At the last possible moment, Aristotle pulled him up, dragged him over to the edge, and sat him down. Coughing and gasping for air, the student could hardly believe what had just occurred. Unmoved by the young man's confusion and surprise, Aristotle simply asked him, "Young man, when I held you under the water, what did you want more than anything in the world?" He sputtered between coughs, "Air, sir . . . air!" Aristotle then responded, "When you want wisdom as badly as you wanted air, then you will find it." John Adams observed: "Facts are stubborn things; and whatever may be our wishes, our inclinations, or the dictates of our passion, they cannot alter the state of facts and evidence." In our information age, the facts and the evidence are readily available to us. We need only to have	1
The Walking Dead star Josh McDermitt has deleted his social media accounts. The actor – who plays survivor Eugene Porter on the popular zombie drama – offered no explanation for the sudden removal of his Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook accounts. Although McDermitt has shied away from giving a reason for his decision, he has received death threats and online abuse in recent weeks, with some viewers at home directing their fury at the poor actor after his (fictional) character Eugene betrayed Rick Grimes and defected to Negan. © AMC Advertisement - Continue Reading Below It's just a TV show, people. And let's not pretend that we would all be Daryl Dixon if we were taken prisoner by Negan. © AMC In a video shared on the night of the season seven finale, which saw Eugene prove his loyalty by openly declaring that he was definitely Negan, McDermitt said he had no time for death threats. "Don't send me death threats, because I will report all that shit to the cops," he said. "I'm just sick of it. "You can hate Eugene, I don't care. You can think whatever you want. But when you start saying you hope I die, I don't know if you're talking about Josh or Eugene. I gotta report that shit, so, just don't be an asshole. "And just stop complaining. Just stop complaining about everything on the internet. Just go spend time with your family or friends or loved ones. Just get off the internet. "I love you, I do. I love you guys." We love you too, Josh. © AMC Gene Page Related: What's next for The Walking Dead? Here's how season 8 could go down Looking ahead to season eight, showrunner Scott Gimple teased what's in store for Eugene and the fallout from his decision to defect. "He has still not found the strength to get over his fear," he said. "He's still Negan after seeing everything Sasha is doing. "I don't think it looks good for Eugene.

Stacey Gayle used to love music. Listening to it and performing it was a big part of her life. She had stacks of CDs in her car, went to concerts of artists like Sean Paul, and would go to parties where hot songs would blare. She was also an active member of the choir at her church: Solid Rock Church of the Nazarene.  Then she started having seizures.  The first one happened while she slept in her bedroom in Rosedale, Queens in New York City on the night of March 3, 2005. She had just turned 22. Her mother rushed her to the emergency room, where doctors stabilized her. Several brain scans and blood tests gave no clue as to why she seized.  Soon after, she had another, this time at a friend's barbecue. She blacked out, fell down and started to shake like crazy as her brain cells went out of whack, firing electrical signals without pause.  At first, the seizures seemed to occur randomly. In the spring of 2006, however, she noticed a pattern. At the time, Sean Paul's "Temperature" was sitting at the top of the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart, continually being played on urban radio stations. It was playing at nearly every barbecue and party she went to. That was a problem: "Every time it would go on, I would pass out and go into a seizure," she recalls.  All it seemed to take was a few seconds of the song to send Gayle to the floor. "That's the last thing you would think," she explains, "but I did it at home one time and it happened again."  To Gayle, it was clear that the music was causing her seizures. Afraid no one would believe her, she didn't tell a soul except for a lone confidant. Her neurologist, Alan Ettinger at the Long Island Jewish Medical Center (LIJ) in New Hyde Park, N.Y., was in the dark as he put her through a gauntlet of prescriptions. She would eventually try out six antiseizure drugs. The medications offered little relief.  "When you look at individuals who have seizures and whose seizures have not responded to a good trial of two antiseizure medications, the chances of becoming seizure-free from another medication, or another after that, is very slim," says Ettinger.  To try to figure out how to treat Gayle, Ettinger and a colleague admitted her to an epilepsy monitoring unit in early 2007. The idea was to let her have a seizure. For four days, she wore a cap studded with electrodes so that doctors could observe her brain waves and videotape her.  They took her off her medications. No seizure came.  The doctors then tried keeping her awake. Nothing.  Gayle was tired of waiting; she had plans to fly to Jamaica the next day. So she told them to hand over her iPod. She put "Temperature" on repeat and drifted off to sleep.  She seized three times that night.  "The doctors were flabbergasted; they were speechless," says Gayle. "They couldn't believe what I was saying was actually true."  The next day, Stacey went to JFK Airport on her way to the Caribbean. But as she approached her gate, she overheard Sean Paul blaring from an airport bar.  She never made it onto her flight.  Soon, the reaction spread. Throughout the next year other popular hip-hop and R&B songs like Rihanna's repetitively infectious "Umbrella" and crooner Sean Kingston's earnest "Beautiful Girl" sent Gayle to the floor. She was also responding to alternative music and the sound of the drums that accompanied her church choir's performances. Suddenly it seemed like the only types of music that weren't causing her to have a seizure were jazz and classical—both of which she didn't particular like.  Gayle was forced to drop out of school that fall because of her illness. Personalized ring tones drove her nuts. "When people's phones were going off in class, I was having a lot of seizures at school," she says. "Life just turns upside down when you take music out of it: I remember sitting outside of stores in the mall and crying because I can't even go shopping or sit in a restaurant and eat."  She briefly took a job, working at a Bank of America in Manhattan. But, she couldn't handle the noises on the subway, and she would seize frequently both on her commute and at the office.  With medication having been an unequivocal failure, her doctors were wondering if they could do anything other than keep music away from her—an unlikely proposition.  Macdonald Critchley first described musicogenic epilepsy—the technical term for seizures caused by music—in a 1937 paper, according to celebrated neurologist Oliver Sacks's latest book	1
Iceland heads into its second snap parliamentary election in less than a year on Saturday with the financial crash that brought the country to its knees nearly a decade ago still playing out in its politics.  The island's economy is thriving again, thanks mainly to an unprecedented tourism boom, but some of its top politicians have been hit by a succession of financial and ethical scandals that have badly dented voters' trust. Row over sexual abuse letter brings down Iceland's government Read more The prime minister, Bjarni Benediktsson, called the election last month after his three-party government collapsed over an alleged attempt to cover up efforts by his father to help "restore the honour" of a convicted child sex offender. Benediktsson formed his centre-right coalition barely 10 months ago, following early elections triggered by his predecessor's resignation. Sigmundur Davíð Gunnlaugsson had stepped down amid public fury at revelations in the Panama Papers that his family had sheltered money offshore. The Guardian revealed this month that while an MP, Benediktsson – whose name also appeared in the Panama Papers – had himself sold millions of króna of assets in a major Icelandic bank's investment fund as the state was about to seize control of the country's failing financial sector at the peak of the 2008 crisis. The prime minister, a member of one of Iceland's wealthiest families, has denied any wrongdoing, but newly leaked documents suggest his relationship with Glitnir bank was close enough to raise serious questions about a possible conflict of interest between his roles as an MP and one of its most valued clients. Iceland PM sold bank assets hours before financial crash, leaks show Read more Glitnir Holdco, which administers the collapsed bank's estate, has since sought an injunction preventing Stundin and Reykjavik Media, the Icelandic news outlets that worked on the investigation with the Guardian, from publishing more of the leaked data. Benediktsson has said he had nothing to do with the gagging order. Despite the scandals, polls show the prime minister's conservative Independence party – a member of 19 of the 27 governments that have run modern Iceland – is now edging ahead in the race with its main rival, the Left-Green Movement, which earlier this month held a clear lead. Headed by 41-year-old Katrín Jakobsdóttir, the Left-Greens have largely succeeded the more traditional Social Democrats as the leading party of the Icelandic left, campaigning against inequality and for greater investment in public services and higher taxes for the better-off. Polls show nearly half of Iceland's voters would like the popular Jakobsdóttir, seen as representing a new breed of politician, to be prime minister – around twice the number who say they plan to vote for her party. A centre-left government would be only the second since Iceland won full independence from Denmark in 1944. At least six other parties – including a new Centre Party launched by Gunnlaugsson – could win seats in the 63-member alþingi in a continuing fragmentation of Icelandic politics that reflect mounting voter dissatisfaction with the cronyism and corruption many see as endemic in their political and business classes.  Iceland was plunged into a deep recession following the 2008 crash, during which its three major banks, including Glitnir, failed with liabilities of 11 times the country's GDP. The stock market fell 97%, the value of the króna halved, and Iceland became the first western European country in 25 years to ask the International Monetary Fund for a bailout.  A perception now exists that Benediktsson, 47, "is part of the elite that crashed the system", said Egill Helgason, a political commentator at the public broadcaster, RUV. The prime minister and his circle suffer from a serious lack of trust in the wake of recent scandals, he said. With growth surging at 7.2% last year, however, and unemployment down at just 2.5%, it seems likely that many Icelandic voters still see the Independence party, which has campaigned on a platform of tax cuts and more business investment, as the most likely to deliver economic stability.	1
MSNBC's Joe Scarborough accused Washington Post reporter Wesley Lowery and Huffington Post's Ryan J. Reilly of getting arrested in Ferguson, Mo., for the attention. Lowery didn't take it lightly. Lowery and Reilly were in a McDonald's charging their phones and filing stories when police told them to leave. The two reporters livetweeted their arrest and filmed the cops as they spoke with them, an action that is legal in all 50 states. The two were soon released, but it's sparked massive outrage on Twitter, largely with other members of the media. Lowery later wrote about the experience for the Washington Post, describing it in detail, while Executive Editor Martin D. Baron said that "there was absolutely no justification for his arrest." On Thursday's Morning Joe, Scarborough spoke about the arrests from the previous night, and while for him, there were still many unanswered questions about the events, he would've done things a lot different than Lowery and Reilly. "I don't sit there and have a debate and film the police officer, unless I want to get on TV and have people talk about me the next day," he added. Both reporters have talked to the cable news circuit after being released by police, but after hearing what Scarborough said during an interview with CNN, Lowery called him out and invited him to come down to Ferguson to find out what's actually going on and to "get out of 30 Rock where he's sitting and sipping his Starbucks smugly." "There's so much happening here, and instead of putting more reporters on the ground we have people like Joe Scarborough running their mouth and have no idea what they're talking about," he said. After his appearance, Lowery wasn't done. He took to Twitter and sent a message to everyone speculating about any possible motives.

A close confidante of former Israeli prime minister Ariel Sharon has said that the leader pulled out of the Gaza Strip in 2005 in order to save the settlement blocs in the West Bank and to improve Israel's security. Sharon, also known as "the bulldozer" for his determination, ordered Israeli troops to began evacuating more than 8,000 Jewish settlers from the Gaza Strip -- first voluntarily, but later forcefully removing those who refused. Dov Weisglass, who served as Sharon's chief of staff, explained why the prime minister made the decision in 2003 to pull out of Gaza during a seminar to mark 10 years since Israel's disengagement from the coastal enclave held at the Interdisciplinary Center (IDC) Herzliya. He recalled how at the time Sharon held a stormy meeting with settler leaders during which he explained to them that the dream of a Greater Israel, in which Israel held on to all of the West Bank and Gaza was no longer possible. Forged during the second Palestinian intifada, or uprising, amid international pressure, the pullout plan was hotly contested within Israel. Sharon defended it at the time by invoking the safety of settlers under constant and frequently deadly Palestinian attack and the drain on resources caused by the heavy army presence needed to protect them. After failing to reach agreement with the Palestinians on the plan, Sharon decided to push ahead unilaterally, arguing there was no partner on the Palestinian side. Weisglass said that Sharon secured a pledge from former US President George Bush over Palestinian refugees in exchange for pulling out of Gaza. According to Weisglass, Bush promised Sharon that in any final status agreement for a two-state solution, Palestinian refugees would settle in a newly established Palestinian state and not return to Israel if Israel pulled out of Gaza. Weisglass referenced a letter that Bush sent to Sharon in 2004 in which the US president promised the Israeli leader that the West Bank settlement blocs would be included within Israel's final borders. "In light of new realities on the ground, including already existing major Israeli populations centers, it is unrealistic to expect that the outcome of final status negotiations will be a full and complete return to the armistice lines of 1949, and all previous efforts to negotiate a two-state solution have reached the same conclusion," Bush wrote, according to Weisglass. Sharon's former confidante said that the US and other world leaders recognized Israel's right to the settlement blocs as a result of the Gaza Disengagement. (With AFP)	1
Syfy has ordered a second season of adventure thriller 12 Monkeys, based on the Terry Gilliam movie, to air in 2016. The first season, which is still airing, was run by Natalie Chaidez who has her own series for Syfy, the upcoming Hunters from Universal Cable Prods and Gale Anne Hurd's Valhalla Productions. She is segueing to that, with Terry Matalas and Travis Fickett, who wrote the 12 Monkeys adaptation and served as co-executive producers on Season 1, named executive producers and showrunners. They are expected to bring in a strong No.2. Atlas Entertainment's Richard Suckle and the film's producer Charles Roven will continue to executive produce with Atlas' Jake Kurily producing for UCP. 12 Monkeys got off to a modest start in Live+same day rating with 1.35 million viewers for its January premiere but has been a DVR powerhouse, setting Live+3 lift records for Syfy (Its average L3 lift to date is 104%). The series' Live+SD ratings also have been inching up after an initial drop, with the most recent episode on March 6 posting 1.5 million viewers, a 6% increase over the prior four weeks. "We are absolutely committed to 12 Monkeys, and have been incredibly impressed by the outstanding critical and audience praise the series has earned," said Syfy president Dave Howe. Added Jeff Wachtel, President and Chief Content Officer, NBCUniversal Cable Entertainment, "12 Monkeys is a show that has exceeded expectations at every stage. It's had a great first season creatively, and is building a dedicated audience." 12 Monkeys, which is eight episodes into its 13-episode first-season run, stars Aaron Stanford, Amanda Schull and Kirk Acevedo. Syfy has yet to make a decision on Helix, whose second season also is airing right now.	1
Take the Seattle Public Library Survey About Their New Logo and "Brand Statement" No matter what they change your name to, you'll always be the Seattle Public Library to me. Max Herman / Shutterstock.com Oh, god, really, Seattle Public Library? You are so committeed up and you have so much extra dough sitting around* that you've hired a design agency "to develop a rebrand"? (Full press release at the end of this post.) Ugh, fine, okay, I'll take your survey. I love the library, I'm happy to help. Here, everyone, take the survey. The first question proposes changing the "brand" from Seattle Public Library to Seattle Public Libraries. Rather than asking what's better, what appeals to you more, what sounds most like the library as you think of it, they ask you what the difference is. As if it's a test to see if you know what words mean. The difference is that one is singular and one is plural. Their survey: Sorry to show you my answers. You should answer your own personal truth. As for which "brand" identity of the two evokes "communities"? Curious question. "Communities" is plural, so the only one that evokes the plural word is the other plural word. Is that really what you wanted to ask? Is this a survey or is this a new-media, feel-good smokescreen for a decision someone wants to make without being on the hook for making a decision? Just change the name if you want to change the name! Clearly, someone wants to change the name, but they also and just as importantly want to be able to say, later, "Well, Susan, everyone who answered the survey said 'libraries' evokes 'communities' more than 'library' does, so we better change it, because democracy." As for question 3: Far be it from me to just underline what a pointless exercise this is with an example, but something that would concretely help us move forward as a community even more than whatever letters you want to hang on the wall is, say, having a microfilm/microfiche situation that doesn't require running back and forth between the microfilm machine and the printer and having to punch in very long sequences of numbers and passwords each time one wants to print a single page. But that's just me. (Sincerely, thanks for all the help couple weeks back, library staff—you are awesome. It's the administrative apparatus around you, epitomized by this goofy rebrand, that fills my head with question marks.) Okay, moving on, it's time to see the new "brand statement"! Here we go. Screengrab from my phone while I was sitting at Madison Pub last night trying to help the library. Ladies and gentlemen, the brand new, surely-worked-over-to-death-by-a-whole-bunch-of-people brand statement. I didn't have room in the field to type the following: 1. Where. Is. Your. Serial. Comma. What. Is. Wrong. With. You. "Provides" and "experiences" are both verbs, and when you don't have a serial comma after "experiences" to make things clear, you can't help but read "experiences" as a verb the first time through (you read it the same way you read "provides") and be confused when you get to "and learning for all." How do you experience "and learning"? God, I wish I could experience some "and learning" right now. Oh you mean "experiences" as a noun! After you read it five or six times, it becomes clear what the SEATTLE PUBLIC LIBRARY is trying to say using words. 2. Kind of. I mean, how much difference is there between "learning" and "knowledge"? How much overlap on the Venn diagram do "learning" and "knowledge" have? If you're going to put three nouns in a row (and confusingly make one of them seem like a verb) it might be clearer to choose three nouns that are distinct from each other, instead of two that are slightly redundant (one of which doesn't even read as a noun the first time through). 3. "We preserve and create opportunities for the people of Seattle who make it such a dynamic and desirable place to live." Huh. Sounds nice. But then it makes you think. What about the people who do not make Seattle both "dynamic and desirable"? What about painfully shy people who rarely leave the house? Are they good, too? Or is the library only for people doing cartwheels and condo conversions? 4. "When we're empowered as individuals, we're STRONGER TOGETHER." Is that possibly from some other piece of text	1
I try to lay my biases out on the table when it comes to reviewing games here so you can get a feel for when I may be judging a game too harshly or if I'm making myself deliberately oblivious to some of the more glaring faults. I believe this works well as you know things like survival horror and open world games are likely to get rated down whilst things like RTS, RPGs and FPSs are usually going to be rated slightly higher (although there are notable exceptions). Still though I try my best to rate a game based on its merits in relation to other titles within the same genre and thus Sleeping Dogs, the latest instalment in the True Crime series from Luxoflux and United Front Games, will be judged against other recent titles like Prototype 2. Sleeping Dogs takes place in present day Hong Kong putting you in control of an undercover agent named Wei Shen. Your job is to infiltrate the infamous Sun On Yee triad in hopes to bring them down from the inside starting out by using one of your former connections to gain a first meeting with one of their Red Poles, Winston Chu. From there the game takes the usual route of open world escalation, starting you off in the doldrums beating up vendors for protection money as you work your way up the gang hierarchy. At the same time the police want to use your connections to help further their cause in other areas leading you to bust up drug rings, smuggling operations and prostitution syndicates. Visually Sleeping Dogs is quite vibrant drawing inspiration from the real Hong Kong's neon saturated environment. From what I can recall the graphics are pretty much on par with other open world titles like Grand Theft Auto IV meaning they're pretty good but they make trade offs in order to keep the game running smoothly as you rush through busy streets crowded with people and cars. I had to actually turn the graphics down slightly from their ultra maximum settings due to the frame rate dropping so much (although that might be an issue rather than a compliment as I'll expand on later). Like all open world games Sleeping Dogs features a multitude of different core game mechanics, mini-games and open world events to while away your time with. The main core of the game is a cross between an Arkham Asylum/City style beat-em-up and Grand Theft Auto's weapon focused game play. Sleeping Dogs also throws free running in there for good measure, allowing you to climb all over different parts of Hong Kong in the search for collectibles, upgrades and cold hard cash. I guess the feeling I'm trying to convey here is that there is certainly a lot to do in Sleeping Dogs, possible even more than I've come across in other recent open world titles. The main plot of the story is progressed via 2 different styles of missions: ones with the triads and the other with the police. These take the usual typical open world style of giving you a way point on your map that you can travel to at your leisure and there's no hard and fast requirement to do the triad and police missions in sync with each other. Indeed I chose to most of the triad missions first as I found them to be more fun (and more rewarding) which did leave me in the rather awkward position of having to travel the full length of the map constantly as I had progressed out of the area in which the police missions take place. I kind of feel like this could have been remedied by the developers by having multiple police locations for the missions which would've saved me quite a bit of time. The experience system also works along the separate cop/triad lines with each of them giving you access to an unique set of upgrades. The triads are focused mostly on melee upgrades, giving you additional moves as well as improving your effectiveness in melee combat. The cop upgrades focus more on vehicles and weapons, giving you access to things like a slim jim to jack cars without setting off the alarms. In addition to the two main upgrade paths there's also several ancillary upgrade paths that unlock more cars, additional melee moves as well as upgrades to your total health. The main experience system works on the idea of stars, with 3 being the highest you can get. They work in different directions however with the police experience starting off at maximum and then you losing points for doing things wrong (like running people over) whilst the triad experience increases, ostensibly for being as brutal as you possibly can be. These two things are in direct competition with each other and it's often a choice between maximising one or the other. What got me though is that the bars need to be completely filled in order for them to be considered achieved meaning that for the police experience you can't do 1 thing wrong and for the triads you really need to go all out at all times in order to get it. The triads one I can understand, its something you work towards, but the cops one feels a bit anal as you can lose points by simply touching another car, depriving you of an entire block of experience even if	1
Correspondence with Fans Concerning the Tower of Joy I have a question which I'm sure you can (and will?) answer. It's about the Tower of Joy. The image we get from Ned's description is pretty powerful. But it doesn't make sense. The top three kingsguards, including the lord commander amd the best knight in ages, Ser Arthur Dayne are present there. Lyanna is in the tower, she asked Ned to promise him something. This, so says the general consensus us little Jon Snow, who is Lyanna's and Rhaegar's. No sense denying this ;) However, what are the Kingsguards doing fighting Eddard? Eddard would never hurt Lyanna, nor her child. The little one would be safe with Eddard as well, him being a close relative. So I ask you, was there someone else with Lyanna and Jon? You'll need to wait for future books to find out more about the Tower of Joy and what happened there, I fear. I might mention, though, that Ned's account, which you refer to, was in the context of a dream... and a fever dream at that. Our dreams are not always literal. Also, did the Kingsguards know what was in the Tower? Certainly. Cheers, I really hope you will answer these questions for me, I'll not bother you again if you do, I promise hahaha. Merry Christmas btw, it's almost on us! And a happy new year to you.

First time that LotR has lost the position since about four editions into the list ... nearly 7 years ago. That's pretty astonishing, considering the huge LOTR presence right now. Very gratifying. I hope I can hold on. Have you seen _The Fellowship of the Ring_ movie yet? There are not a few fans curious as to your reaction to it, and whether you think it'll spell the beginning of a revival of major Hollywood fantasy projects. :) I have seen the movie three times so far. I have quibbles, certainly... but all in all I thought it was magnificent, far and away the best fantasy film ever made. As to whether it will mean a general revival of fantasy in Hollywood... well, we can hope. If they are all done as well as FELLOWSHIP, that would be exciting indeed, but I fear they won't be. On a personal level, the studios aren't lining up to buy A SONG OF ICE AND FIRE yet, but it does look as though I am about to close a film deal on "The Skin Trade," and there is some interest in WILD CARDS as well. The WILD CARDS revival is going very well, by the way. I just turned in the first new book, DEUCES DOWN, which is scheduled for publication this summer.

And I think that's one of the reasons why you're hearing more about guns. It's just easier to regulate those than it is to try and figure out what to do with people who have serious mental illness.	1
Columbus, Ohio ( ) — Researchers have found that the melanopsin pigment in the eye is potentially more sensitive to light than its more famous counterpart, rhodopsin, the pigment that allows for night vision. For more than two years, the staff of the Laboratory for Computational Photochemistry and Photobiology (LCPP) at Ohio's Bowling Green State University (BGSU), have been investigating melanopsin, a retina pigment capable of sensing light changes in the environment, informing the nervous system and synchronizing it with the day/night rhythm. Most of the study's complex computations were carried out on powerful supercomputer clusters at the Ohio Supercomputer Center (OSC). Superposition of computer models of human melanopsin (violet) and squid rhodopsin (green). Similar to visual pigments, melanopsin provides the interface between the physical world, responsible for light detection, and the physiological world of brain signaling. Melanopsin mediates a process termed 'photoentrainment,' which takes in light to set the clock of "circadian rhythms." These rhythms (often termed the body clock) represent the biological implementation of the 24-hour day/night and optimize the corresponding physiology The research recently appeared in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA, in an article edited by Arieh Warshel, Ph.D., of the University of Southern California. Warshel and two other chemists received the 2013 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for developing multiscale models for complex chemical systems, the same techniques that were used in conducting the BGSU study, "Comparison of the isomerization mechanisms of human melanopsin and invertebrate and vertebrate rhodopsins." "The retina of vertebrate eyes, including those of humans, is the most powerful light detector that we know," explains Massimo Olivucci, Ph.D., a research professor of Chemistry and director of LCPP in the Center for Photochemical Sciences at BGSU. "In the human eye, light coming through the lens is projected onto the retina where it forms an image on a mosaic of photoreceptor cells that transmits information from the surrounding environment to the brain's visual cortex. In extremely poor illumination conditions, such as those of a star-studded night or ocean depths, the retina is able to perceiv e intensities corresponding to only a few photons, which are indivisible units of light. Such extreme sensitivity is due to specialized photoreceptor cells containing a light sensitive pigment called rhodopsin." For a long time, it was assumed that the human retina contained only photoreceptor cells specialized in dim-light and daylight vision, according to Olivucci. However, recent studies revealed the existence of a small number of intrinsically photosensitive nervous cells that regulate non-visual light responses. These cells contain a rhodopsin-like protein named melanopsin, which plays a role in the regulation of unconscious visual reflexes and in the synchronization of the body's responses to the dawn/dusk cycle, known as circadian rhythms or the "body clock," through a process known as photoentrainment. The fact that the melanopsin density in the vertebrate retina is 10,000 times lower than that of rhodopsin density, and that, with respect to the visual photoreceptors, the melanopsin-containing cells capture a million-fold fewer photons, suggests that melanopsin may be more sensitive than rhodopsin. The comprehension of the mechanism that makes this extreme light sensitivity possible appears to be a prerequisite to the development of new technologies. Both rhodopsin and melanopsin are proteins containing a derivative of vitamin A, which serves as an "antenna" for photon detection. When a photon is detected, the proteins are set in an activated state, through a photochemical transformation, which ultimately results in a signal being sent to the brain. Thus, at the molecular level, visual sensitivity is the result of a trade-off between two factors: light activation and thermal noise. It is currently thought that light-activation efficiency (i.e., the number of activation events relative to the total number of detected photons) may be related to its underlying speed of chemical transformation. On the other hand, the thermal noise depends on the number of activation events triggered by ambient body heat in the absence of photon detection. "Understanding the mechanism that determines this seemingly amazing light sensitivity of melanopsin may open up new pathways in studying the evolution of light receptors in vertebrate and, in turn, the molecular basis of diseases, such as "seasonal affecting disorders," Olivucci said. "Moreover, it provides a model for developing sub-nanoscale sensors approaching the sensitivity of a single-photon." For this reason, the LCPP group – working together with Francesca Fanelli, Ph.D., of Italy's Università di Modena e Reggio Emilia	1

Back with new album Carry On, singer-songwriter Willy Mason is currently touring the UK – following a five-year hiatus where he worked as a fisherman, builder, talk radio DJ and teacher. And having tried a variety of day-jobs, the American musician claims that a classroom full of kids is infinitely more scary than a venue full of punters. Speaking ahead of his live shows this week, Mason said: "I got worse stage fright than I ever did playing music. It's scary. It's a lot of responsibility being called a teacher. "When I got to 24, I decided that I would have a lot better things to write about if I went off the road for a little while. I wanted to stay in touch with day-to-day life as my peers were living it." Mason also indicated that it might not be the last time he disappears. "Hopefully it won't be called a hiatus next time. I've learned in my old age how to shift gears without destroying the transmission." For the moment he's sticking with music, and on the new album he worked with Hot Chip and M.I.A producer Dan Carey. "Working with him bought a lot of new influences from me, that hadn't had the chance to present themselves before really. His moonshine-soaked sound and emotive lyrics mean that he is often compared to Bob Dylan. "Every time someone comes along with thought out lyrics and stories, they get really excited and call it the new Bob Dylan. I wish I had more to offer them. I wish there was more of it going on." His tour calls in at seven UK venues over the coming week or so, and Mason is hoping for big things. "There's a lot more possibilities with the sound. I feel like I'm taking on a bit of a challenge for the sake of shows, but if I pull it off I think it'll be something special." See Willy Mason at the following dates: Mar 8: The Wardrobe, Leeds Mar 9: Old Town Hall, Gateshead Mar 10: Oran Mor, Glasgow Mar 12: The Kazimier, Liverpool Mar 13: The Rescue Rooms, Nottingham Mar 15: The Limelight, Belfast Get tickets  Willy Mason – Pickup Truck on MUZU.TV.

By Thanasis Delistathis* / @tdelistathis Friends often ask me to opine on the Greek debt crisis. They are looking for some insight into what is going on and why the country is at the brink of bankruptcy. I suppose they think my heritage makes me more qualified to offer such insight. The Greek crisis in many ways is a simple story; the predictable outcome of policies and cultural idiosyncrasies. So here is an attempt to tell the story with a few charts: 1. Define it. Why is Greece in trouble?  2. Did Greece get in trouble because Greeks don't work hard ("you know, with those long siestas over lunch"), kind of like the Germans? No. 3. So, if the Greeks work so hard, how come they don't produce enough to cover their obligations? 4. Why is productivity so low? Over the years, politicians have grown the size of government. They also love to regulate. Over the last 30 years they have passed 4,000 new laws and issued about 110,000 ministerial directives. You need a lot of people to enforce these laws. Public servants in Greece get lifetime tenure!! Politicians loved growing the government to curry favor with voters. 5. At the same time, Greeks love to strike to fight for more benefits. Politicians were happy to offer more. 6. Speaking of state favoritism, how about corruption in general? Greece ranks at the bottom within the EU. 7. On top of that, on average Greeks retire earlier… 8. And thus have a higher dependency support ratio (ratio of number of people aged over 65 plus kids up to 15 per 100 persons of working age between 15–65). In reality, this significantly underestimates the true dependency ratio, since the country suffers from high rates of youth unemployment and many people retire before the age of 65. In other words, too many people depend for their livelihood on the too few who work. 9. At the same time, the government is not bringing in enough revenues. How do we know this? Greece has the largest – as percentage of the economy – shadow or underground economy. 10. How can they escape taxes? Most of the people work for tiny businesses who conduct private cash transactions that can more easily be hidden. 11. And by the way, the number of those businesses in going down… 12. While the VAT taxes remain high relative to others in Europe… 13. So, to sum it up Greece doesn't seem to be a great place to do business. 14. How bad? One group ranks the country 130th in the world… 15. OK, so catch me up. What has happened to date? 16. Has Greece actually accomplished anything during this process? Greece actually grew during the first 3 quarters of 2014. 17. Say, what happened in Q4 of 2014? Looking at Chart 15 you might appreciate why Greeks were fed up with ongoing non-stop austerity measures. So they decided to elect a radical left coalition party that promised to undo the former policies. However, it seems consumers don't have much confidence that the new leftist government will be able to reach an agreement with its eurozone partners. 18. As fears also grew among investors, the cost of borrowing from the markets spiked… 19 a. What does Greece need to do? Here is a list of policy recommendations from OECD for sustainable recovery, similar to the spirit of the reforms proposed by Greece's EU partners. 19 b. To date, the Syriza government has not shown any signs of agreement with the eurozone partners, choosing instead to comply with campaign promises of undoing many reforms by the prior government. Some in the left coalition government are openly advocating a default, exit from the Euro and return to the drachma. In fact, there are some economists who say this would be best for Greece as it would enable it to become competitive in global markets. While good in theory in an open well-functioning economy, the first time Greece elected a socialist government that followed similar policies, the drachma had quite a ride, downwards… 20. In this era of uncertainty, businesses and investors have postponed investments and reversed economic growth, prompting the European Commission to slash growth estimates. At this point, the future is indeed uncertain. Will the Syriza government agree to EU/IMF conditions for further loans and implement the program or choose to gamble with an exit from the Euro? We are days or weeks away from finding out. *Thanasis Delistathis is the founder and managing partner of New Atlantic Ventures, an early-stage venture capital firm based in the Washington DC Metropolitan Region and Cambridge, Massachusetts.

The playmaker is set to be the subject of a bid from his former club in January, while Martin Demichelis will discuss terms over a new Manchester City contract By Paul Clennam Valencia are lining up a €38 million January move for Juan Mata - but must wait for Peter Lim to complete his takeover of the Spanish side before pursuing a deal for the Manchester United playmaker.Lim, a Singapore-based businessman, has played a part in summer loan deals for Alvaro Negredo and Benfica pair Rodrigo and Andre Gomes, but is yet to reach an agreement with Bankia over the acquisition of the club.Valencia have the option to sign Manchester City striker Negredo for €32 million and should Lim's purchase of the club go through, they will also turn their attention to re-signing Mata.The former Chelsea star left Valencia for Stamford Bridge in 2011 but fell out of favour under Jose Mourinho and made a €47m January move to Old Trafford in 2014.The summer arrival of Louis van Gaal, followed by the signings of Radamel Falcao, Angel Di Maria and Ander Herrera, have seen Mata's place in the starting XI come under threat.And while it is unclear whether Mata would consider a return to Spain, United are understood to be willing to entertain offers of around €38m for the 26-year-old.Valencia are weighing up the possibility of signing Mata on an initial loan deal in January with a view to a permanent move in the summer.But any potential deal to sign Mata would be impossible if Lim's takeover of the club falls through.Lim has also recently acquired a 50 per cent stake in Salford City, the Evo-Stik Division One North outfit part-owned by former United players Ryan Giggs, Paul Scholes, Gary and Phil Neville and Nicky Butt.Teenage forward Jose Angel Pozo's emergence as a Manchester City star in the making has cost the club a six-figure fee.Pozo joined the Premier League champions in 2012 from Real Madrid's youth setup, much to the chagrin of the Spanish giants.The 18-year-old, who has been likened to Barcelona star Lionel Messi, has since caught the eye in City's Elite Development Squad under the guidance of Patrick Vieira.Manuel Pellegrini handed Pozo his debut off the bench in the Capital One Cup victory over Sheffield Wednesday in midweek, with the teenager scoring late on in the 7-0 rout.Following his first appearance and goal for the club, City must now pay Madrid a six-figure fee as part of the deal which took Pozo to the Etihad.Martin Demichelis will discuss a 12-month contract extension with Manchester City in the coming weeks.Demichelis played under Manuel Pellegrini at Malaga and joined the Chilean at the Etihad in 2013 after a short stay with Atletico Madrid which lasted less than two months.The 33-year-old endured a difficult start to life in the Premier League and did not make his debut until October due to injury, but made a significant contribution as the club reclaimed the title last season.The centre-back's form saw him take part in the 2014 World Cup, playing in the final as Argentina narrowly lost to Germany.Despite the big-money summer arrival of Eliaquim Mangala, Demichelis is now set to extend his stay in the Premier League.	1
AFL Players Association chief Paul Marsh admitted the players' union had already planned end-of-season talks with head office, although stressed what most clubs had confirmed – that the players have not questioned their earnings. Having attempted to set a minimum player wage of $5000 for the eight-week pre-season followed by the eight-week season, the AFL late last year negotiated a new set minimum with the AFLPA of $8500, to be increased to $9700 in 2018. If the above suggests the league did not see this success coming so quickly, it is also worth recalling that the AFL tried to schedule its first women's game at Collingwood's training ground – the old Olympic Park – and finished up apologising to thousands of fans unable to squeeze into Carlton's Ikon Park, where almost 25,000 attended. Although the women's contracts are proportionately paltry when measured against TV ratings, the clubs fielding the eight women's teams continue to marvel at how enthusiastic their players have been to promote their sport compared with their male counterparts. In short, club officials are not used to footballers showing their appreciation. Several Brisbane Lions AFLW players cried when they were handed new football boots along with a set of runners and like those overstretched AFL staffers working long hours to put on the games, Marsh said players understood they were all working overtime together to achieve a common purpose. "We've agreed to a standard playing contract for two years in good faith," said Marsh, "and they [the AFL] could hold us to that, but we've already flagged we want to have a conversation with them and they've agreed. "What we're seeing is eight teams and eight sets of players who all want to do more. They are contracted to work for nine hours a week in terms of training and other appearances and they're all doing more and they have no complaints about that. From our perspective there's scope to have conversations with the AFL where we look at that for next year." The AFL refused to speculate on a new women's media deal, saying it was too soon to measure the TV success just two rounds in, but would not rule out rewriting the agreement. How could it not on the figures to date? The Western Bulldogs' victory over Fremantle two weeks ago was the top-rating program in Melbourne that week, defeating My Kitchen Rules in a result that astonished the Seven Network. On market value, broadcasters and the AFL agree a prime-time women's game is worth the same as Seven's Saturday night winter AFL game. This is because Saturday night telecasts of AFLW have, in their infancy, rated as well as their male AFL equivalents, and on many comparisons better. On pay TV, Fox reports that the competition has quadrupled its male A-League numbers. In ratings terms, the women Australian rules footballers' wages look embarrassing when compared with the soccer men. On every measure that counts, the AFL should be laughing all the way to the bank. As should its new breed of players. Except that they're not, because the competition gave away the broadcast rights for free to Channel Seven and Foxtel on a two-year goodwill agreement. At one point the two parties even haggled over the production costs although in the end the networks picked up the tab, outsourcing the production of all games to Eddie McGuire's McGuire Media. An agreement which only weeks ago appeared as if its broadcasters were doing the AFL a favour now presents as a bargain of the highest order. The decision to allow spectators to attend free has introduced new supporters to football, according to head office, and is likely to continue next season. New corporate partners such as Chemist Warehouse and Cotton On – supporting the women until at least the end of 2019 with a further three-year option – would not have come aboard the AFL without the women. The competition was disappointed Sydney failed to bid for a licence but the consequence is that GWS has signed more AFLW members (2000 at $60 each) and introduced new major sponsors to the club in Harvey Norman and Sydney Airport. Never have the Giants, still battling for recognition, received so much pre-season publicity. The short-term decisions facing the competition include where and when to hold the AFLW version of the Brownlow and whether to schedule a Melbourne grand final at the MCG or Ikon Park. But those appear insignificant compared with the looming review into how to handle the next phase of the AFLW - a competition launched in haste by impatient CEO Gillon McLachlan, but one that will surely prove his greatest legacy.	1
In a recent survey of 926 public high school biology teachers across the nation, only 28 percent of teachers taught evolution as a well-supported fundamental idea of science. Meanwhile, 13 percent openly supported "intelligent design" in the classroom, and 60 percent fell somewhere in-between. This majority presented evolution cautiouslyby including non-scientific viewpoints, by limiting discussion to genetics, or by saying that students only needed to learn the material to pass exams. What do you think about this?  Bill Nye, Executive Director of the Planetary Society: It's horrible. Science is the key to our future, and if you don't believe in science, then you're holding everybody back. And it's fine if you as an adult want to run around pretending or claiming that you don't believe in evolution, but if we educate a generation of people who don't believe in science, that's a recipe for disaster. We talk about the Internet. That comes from science. Weather forecasting. That comes from science. The main idea in all of biology is evolution. To not teach it to our young people is wrong. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Why is there resistance to teaching evolution in schools?  It's reluctance to change. It's wanting the world to be different than it is. And if you don't want the world to be different you are an unusual human being. We all want the world to be different. But to deny evolution is in no one's best interest. Do you think there's anything that can be done about it?  Well the longest journey starts with just a single step. Science education: We should support it. Especially elementary school science. Nearly every rocket scientist got interested in it before they were 10. Everybody who's a physician, who makes vaccines, who wants to find the cure for cancer. Everybody who wants to do any medical good for humankind got the passion for that before he or she was 10. So we want to excite a new generation of kidsevery generationabout the passion, beauty and joythe PB&Jof science. These anti-evolution people are frustrating in two ways. The first way is, almost certainly they know better. Those people really do believe in flu shots. They really do understand that when you find fossil bones of ancient dinosaurs, you are looking at deep time, not just 5000 years. And secondly, and much more importantly, having raised a generation of kids who don't understand science is bad for everyone. And with the United States having a leadership role in science and technology, having a generation of kids not believing in science is bad for the world. Is there a funding issue? Is that why the teachers aren't teaching it correctly?  Oh the teachers get pulled every which way. People get on school boards just with this agenda of not teaching evolution. The school board comes running in and beats them over the head. But denying the facts does not make them not true. And in science we're always looking for the truth, it's what we do. Does this work? Does this solve the problem? Can you do the same experiment and get the same results? Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Should teachers be mandated to teach evolution as fact?  What other fundamental theory in all of biology is there? Intelligent design, as the judge in Dover, Penn., said, is "breathtaking inanity." It was so stupid it took his breath away. I agree with him. It's great to teach in history class, though. People believed the earth was the center of the universe. People believed the earth was flat. It was reasonable at the time, but we don't learn about those ideas in science class. So do you think those biology teachers are simply teaching their own beliefs, or are they under outside pressure?  They're doing their job but they're under tremendous pressure. The 60 percent who are cautiousthose are the people who are really up against it. They want to keep their job, and they love teaching science, and their children are really excited about it, and yet they've got some people insisting they can't teach the most fundamental idea in all of biology. There's the phrase "just a theory." Which shows you that I have failed. I'm a failure. When we have a theory in science, it's the greatest thing you can have. Relativity is a theory, and people test it every which way. They test it and test it and test it. Gravity is a theory. People have landed spacecraft on the moon within a few feet of accuracy because we understand gravity so well. People make flu vaccinations that stop people from getting sick. Farmers raise crops with science; they hybridize them and make them better with every generation. That's all evolution. Evolution is a theory, and it's a theory that you can test. We've tested evolution in many ways. You can't present good evidence that says evolution is not a fact.	1
Researchers at the Argonne National Laboratory this week showed how an electronic voting machine model that's expected to be widely used to tally votes in the 2012 elections can be easily hacked using inexpensive, widely-available electronic components. Roger Johnston, head of the Vulnerability Assessment Team at the U.S. Department of Energy's science and engineering reseaech lab, said the hack, which requires about $25 and very little technical expertise, would let cybercriminals "flip" votes gathered on Diebold Accuvote TS machines and change election results without raising any suspicion. Johnston and his team have long warned about vulnerabilities in e-voting machines. And two years ago, the team demonstrated how a Sequoia touch screen e-voting machine could be similarly manipulated using cheap components. The latest research was first reported by the Salon news site. In the latest experiment, the Argonne researchers showed how a Diebold Accuvote TS touch screen voting machine can be compromised by inserting a man-in-the middle electronic component to intercept the vote cast by a voter and change it before it is recorded by the system. The component which is less than half the size of a credit card, was assembled using a $1.29 microprocessor and a homemade circuit board that cost less than $10 to assemble. The handmade component, which Johnston calls "alien electronics," can be simply plugged into a ribbon cable inside the system. There is no need to solder it on to the system, he noted. Once installed the "alien electronics" can be controlled remotely from a distance of up to a half mile using an ordinary store-brought $15 remote control. Johnston said the machine is "incredibly easy to tamper with" because all the crucial electronic components are accessible and can be easily modified. The Accuvote TS' enclosure isn't tamper resistant so hjackers can work on the machine without leaving visible signs, he added. "All we had to do was find out what the machine was doing in terms of communication," Johnston said. "We just had to understand the various components and how the data was being sent. We needed to understand what signal had to be sent to fool the machine into thinking the voter had touched the screen at a particular location." The experiment shows that e-voting systems are susceptible to more than just cyberattacks, which get the most attention but are harder to pull off as the perpetrators must have some knowledge of the machine's software, hardware and firmware. The so-called man-in-the-middle attacks don't require knowledge of the voting machine's proprietary software or hardware, Johnston said. "All you need to do is understand the communication between the different parts of the system. Then you just sit there and listen and do whatever mischief you want to.". The Diebold intrusion was simpler than the Sequoia hack, which required his team to program the man-in the middle component to get the machine to alert users that their votes had been cast as well as changing the selection, he said. "[The latest hack] was ridiculously easy. We just had to control the information coming in from the voter. If you send the computer the wrong candidate it simply assumes the data that is being sent is what the voter meant," Johnston said. And "we could easily tamper with the printer output where the paper record would match what was stored electronically," he added. Johnston described the microprocessor and the other electronic parts used in the experiment as the sort that can be easily purchased at hobby stores or online. The chip could be programmed by people with only rudimentary skills, he noted. "We wanted people not to get so hung up on cyber vulnerabilities," and consider other threats as well, he said. Voting systems are often left unguarded when they are not in use or while in transit and can easily be tampered without anyone knowing about it, he added. The Diebold Accuvote TS is a direct recording electronic voting (DRE) machine, a type that has long drawn flak because it offers no verifiable paper record. Some experts also consider them unreliable, too hard to audit and prone to all sorts of tampering. Supporters of DRE systems insist that such concerns are overblown. According to statistics maintained by election watchdog Verified Voting, several states, including Delaware, Georgia, Louisiana, Maryland, New Jersey and South Carolina currently use DREs without auditable paper trails. Several other states, including Indiana, Pennsylvania, Texas, Tennessee and Virginia, use a combination of paperless DREs as well as paper ballots -- 32 states and the District of Columbia have laws that require DREs to be used only with verifiable paper records. Pamela Smith, president of Verified Voting, said that the successful hack by Johnston's team is not surprising. "On	1
Previous Chapter | Index | Next Chapter Chapter 2: Relieving Translated by: Chua Edited by: XRCO and Elkassar After Mogensha heard his suggestion, he knew that Sheyan intended for him to take the front lines and attract their attention. Normally, he wouldn't be willing to let others use him in such a manner, yet he also understood the terrifying level the Metals professor and Fanu had reached! Yet, in the previous world, the one that caused the death of the Metals professor and Fanu and survived, was this man called Seaman – the Seaman who had an innate defensive ability! This cruel reality further established Mogensha's belief – This person must be made a friend, and not the enemy! After putting to rest his thoughts, Mogensha coughed loudly and attracted the attention of everyone else. He raised his voice. "I am the golden AK user, Mogensha. Everyone probably have heard of my name before right? Is there anyone able to attack the two beasts outside?" After he issued the statement, at least 5-6 others displayed an astonished expression, beginning whispering in each others ears. Seated in front of him, a male wearing a leather jacket frowned. "I can, but firstly It isn't enough to kill them, and I feel there isn't a need to. Let the other transport ship distract them, wouldn't it be better? This will secure our safe landing." Mogensha laughed coldly, and ignored him. Opposite, a female very resolutely offered. "I reckon I can communicate with the pilot first. If there is a need to retaliate, then we would definitely do so. But first I need to know the reason." Obviously this woman's prime ability should be her charm, but naturally she didn't receive a resolute answer – because Mogensha himself did not understand what Sheyan was coming at. But Mogensha understood one thing, and that was Sheyan wished to attack the pursuing twin beasts a the back. If he couldn't even accomplish the first request of Seaman, then his personal worth would no doubt decrease. Mogensha acted decisively, drawing out his golden AK and aimed towards the 3 safety straps before releasing fire. He then reach out for the metal safety belt and exerted force lightly. A piercing metal cranking sound resounded, as he pulled off the metal safety straps that were binding him; finally standing up. "What are you trying to do!" Several stunned voices probed out. Disregarding them, Mogensha directly strode towards the little shuttle at the pilot cabin; releasing a robotic yet frustrated tone. "Hoi! Mate in front. The two alien freaks have already annihilated at least 20 of our bros, and they look like they're about to succeed again. Are we just gonna stay here stupidly?" The pilot snarled back. "Do you think I don't want to wreck their ass? F***, I swear on my son's baseball cap. If this was a Valkyrie (anti-fighter spacecraft), then I would serve these two spore wyverns a taste of 8 rounds of H.A.L.O (High Altitude Long Operating) cluster rockets! But this is a bloody transport shuttle, although it is a specially enforced transport shuttle! Rather, you better F***king scram to your seat and buckle up!" Mogensha shrugged his shoulders dejectedly. "Alright, looks like the only thing we can do is pray for them." The pilot cleared his throat and suddenly issued. "Wait wait, I remember while reinforcing this shuttle, that old Nick seemed to have installed a machine cannon. But the shuttle took off before there was time to link it to the firing system. But if you have confidence in yourself, then I can open the firing compartment. Yo still have to operate it manually. Truthfully, I don't suggest you doing that." Mogensha exposed a crafty smile. "Just wait and watch the show." The pilot extended a thumbs up without turning to him. Pressing somewhere, a long drawn out 'Chi' sound emitted from the ceiling rampart. Another pilot chair rotated as it descended. Mogensha arrogantly took his seat, and ascended with the chair. The male in the leather jacket looked on disapprovingly, yet he didn't dare to voice out. Mogensha's golden AK was a rather impressive deterrent. In a flash, illuminated tracer rounds were fired out from the hood of the transportation shuttle; directly piercing the body of a predatory spore wyvern. The unprepared spore wyvern immediately lost balance and starting rolling in mid space, screeching out in agony. Huge greenish sticky fluid gushed out from its	1
Slobodan Jovanovich, one of the former leaders of the special units of Serbian police that committed ethnic cleansing in Kosovo, in an interview for the Kosovo public television "RTK" mention some of the most monstrous crimes that Serbian police did in Kosovo. In Slobodan Jovanovich's squad were 150 policemen, 10 of them were criminals released from prisons. "We had 150 policemen in our squad. 10 of the them were well-known for stealing, killing and massacres, that I couldn't believe. They did not use drugs and alcohol, but were interested in getting rich within a night. I remember an occasion in Rahovec. A policeman cut an Albanian's head and boiled it for a couple of days with the intension of getting the golden teeth he had. I am telling this because this haunts me back and I want it to be easier. After boiling it for three days he took his head and turned it in a lampshade. This is monstrosity. I can't comprehend it. I did not know what he was boiling in there. I thought he was preparing dinner. At a later time he did the same thing with the head of a woman. At home he wanted two head, two lampshades. A couple of years later I heard he ended in a nuthouse. That's due to what he did, because a normal person could not do what he did", confessed Jovanovich. "While we were in the field they told us "destruct or burn", which meant, destroy the whole village or burn the entire place down. They did kill people for fun, even if someone didn't have any money. They took everything they put their eyes on it. The higher chain of command knew it pretty well. The commanders ordered the destruction of your houses and killing of innocent civilians", added Jovanovich. The former commander of the special units highlighted that due to these testimonies he is considered a traitor and his family doesn't get any services at all. He has been threatened to give up his testimonials. He knows that there are at least 300 war criminals that live freely in Belgrade. "None in Belgrade protects me. They consider me enemy. They have excluded me of every service", added Jovanovich. Top Channel	1
As of last night's Bachelorette premiere, it looks like JoJo Fletcher's season of the ABC reality dating series could be one of the most promisingly diverse in recent memory. Handsome dudes like firefighter Grant, motorcycle-riding Christian, and Ali, the son of Iranian immigrants (JoJo is herself half Iranian), are all seemingly poised to stick around for a while. There was, however, one glaring exception to this otherwise positive trend: Jon. Poor Jon. The show's first contestant of Asian descent in years emerged from the limo wearing a kilt. That's a bold fashion choice, but in an episode where a guy introduced himself in a full Santa costume, not even the night's boldest. Kilt or no kilt, Jon's first encounter with JoJo is doomed from the moment he opens his mouth. "I'm half Chinese and half Scottish. But luckily for me, I'm half Scottish below the waist," he tells her, then adds, "I am not wearing any panties." Advertisement We're going to give the show the benefit of the doubt and assume that's a joke that Jon decided to make himself and not one that was fed to him by a producer. Even so, it's downright depressing that—when we finally get to see a man of Asian descent in this franchise, theoretically portrayed as someone worthy of romantic and sexual attraction—his heritage is literally reduced to a punchline, undergirded by a harmful stereotype about penis size. In the immortal words of Tyra Banks, we were all rooting for you. Inside the house, the other contestants pile on Jon's traditional Scottish attire, making Jon perhaps the only person in Bachelor history to have been mocked for two different aspects of his cultural background at once. "That's gotta be one of the worst things you could have possibly chosen to wear on the night you're going to meet potentially your future wife," says Robby, apparently not a Braveheart fan, in a talking-head interview.

Defensive end Jerry Hughes was so unblockable during a Buffalo Bills' offseason practice that head coach Rex Ryan had to pull him off the field in order for the offense to get work done. "It's rare that you have to pull a guy from practice because he's ruining your practice, but I had to pull him," Ryan told the Bills' official website. "If we were keeping track he might have had five, six sacks." The Rudy-esque effort from Hughes, while appreciated by Ryan, needed to be halted for the benefit of the team. Coaches have such limited time to evaluate their squads in the offseason that it only makes sense to sit a guy down when he's blowing up every offensive play. "It's one of those deals, it's like, 'OK, let's pull him out. Let's get a pass off or something like that.' He really did have that kind of day." Hughes has quietly been one of the best pass rushers in the league over the past two seasons, accumulating 19 sacks since coming to Buffalo in 2013. He signed a five-year, $45-million contract with the Bills in the offseason.	1

Calgary will soon have a specific plan to resettle up to 2,300 Syrian refugees, according to Mayor Naheed Nenshi, who called on city residents to welcome the newcomers "with open arms" once they arrive. Nenshi said the city will announce a specific resettlement strategy "probably sometime this week or next," in conjunction with the federal and provincial governments. Recent terrorist attacks in France and Lebanon shouldn't deter that plan, he added. "I need to point out that the people who are desperate refugees are fleeing the exact same people who perpetrated the kind of violence that we saw in Paris and in Beirut last week," Nenshi said. "They're running away from the bad guys and, as such, we need to be able to open our arms to make sure we can provide safety to these folks." Suspend plan, says Brad Wall The mayor's position stands in contrast to that of Saskatchewan Premier Brad Wall, who wrote a public letter to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau that calls on the federal government to suspend its refugee plan. "The recent attacks in Paris are a grim reminder of the death and destruction even a small number of malevolent individuals can inflict upon a peaceful country and its citizens," Wall wrote. Nenshi said he read Wall's letter and thought it raised "perfectly reasonable" concerns, but he disagreed with the premier's conclusion that the process should be slowed down. "I would argue the right way to do this is to get the right screening in place and the number of refugees that are accepted are an outcome of the screening as opposed to starting with the number," Nenshi said. Meeting to resettle 1,100 refugees planned Up to 2,300 refugees are expected in Calgary over the next few months. The Calgary Catholic Immigration Society (CCIS) says there will be a public forum held on Thursday to communicate the plan to resettle roughly 1,100 of them in the city. It will be held from 9 a.m. to noon at the John Dutton Theatre at Calgary Public Library's central branch downtown. "Since the announcement that Canada will accept 25,000 Syrian refugees, CCIS has been proactive in gathering community-based organizations to begin the dialogue and plans to settle and integrate these newcomers into our city," said the non-profit group in a release. The meeting will identify how the organization hopes to roll out the resettlement program here in the city and will hear from each community service provider involved. To RSVP to the forum, email syrianproject@ccis-calgary.ab.ca.	1

Madam tells all: Self-described escort Katina Powell, 43, has penned a tell-all book claiming that she was paid $10,000 to put on strip shows involving sex for University of Louisville's basketball recruits and players A tell-all book written by an escort claiming that a former University of Louisville men's basketball staffer hired her nearly two dozen times to provide strippers to dance and have sex with Cardinals recruits, their fathers and players has sent shockwaves through the college basketball world. The expose, Breaking The Cardinal Rules: Basketball and the Escort Queen, co-written by Louisville madam Katina Powell and Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Dick Cady, first surfaced on Amazon as a Kindle book last week, briefly catapulting to No 1 on the best-seller list in the sports category. A hardcover version is expected to come out Monday. The 104-page e-book, which is largely based on the contents of Powell's five personal journals detailing her sexual escapades, alleges that Louisville's former director of basketball operations Andre McGee hired her and other dancers for 22 shows performed from 2010 to 2014, mostly at the Billy Minardi Hall dormitory. She said McGee, 28, paid her $10,000 for her services. According to Powell, 43, the parties thrown for Louisville recruits, their fathers and existing players involved sex with the strippers. In one of the most shocking revelations in the book, an unapologetic Powell writes that she provided her own three daughters, who were 15, 17 and 19 years old at the time, as escorts for sex with the players. 'People may think that I expose my kids,' an excerpt from Powell's diary printed in the book reads. 'But, s***, they enjoy themlselves, they meet new people Believe me, they have their own lives, but they enjoy the perks of shows. 'For those who have a problem wit' this, kiss my a**.' Special recruitment: The 104-page e-book, which is largely based on the contents of Powell's alleges that Louisville's former director of basketball operations Andre McGee (pictured) hired her and other dancers for 22 shows performed from 2010 to 2014 Witness speaks: Former Cardinals recruit JaQuan Lyle, now an Ohio State freshman, confirmed the 'gist of allegations' laid out in Powell's book during a meeting with NCAA Four investigations have been launched, two this week, to review Powell's explosive allegations. In Chapter 1 of Breaking The Cardinal Rules, Powell and Cady write that in 2010, Powell, a high school dropout in her late 30s, was a divorced mother of three daughters struggling to make ends meet. Around the same time, she came to the realization that she could make easy money selling her body for sex. Bombshell tome: The expose, Breaking The Cardinal Rules: Basketball and the Escort Queen, co-written by Powell and Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Dick Cady, was initially released as a Kindle book Friday. A hardcover version will be published Monday 'No overhead, no taxes, no complaints, no regrets. Sugar for sugar,' she writes in the book. Before long, she joined a local escort service called Cheetah's, but Powell was unhappy that 60 per cent of her intake had to go to the owner. Seeking a greater degree of financial independence, Powell launched a 'dance troupe' made up of unmarried friends 'who didn't mind strip-teasing' in clubs and at private bachelor parties. 'Naturally, a girl could pick up extra cash by giving customers the satisfaction they sought after becoming thoroughly inflamed watching a half-dozen chocolate-skinned babes flaunting their goodies,' she says tellingly in her expose. Powell writes that the person who first introduced her to the idea of putting on shows at the University of Louisville was her friend Tink, who owned a local barber shop that was frequented by some of the college basketball players. It was Tink, according to Powell, who put her in touch with Andre McGee about arranging adult entertainment for U of L recruits. McGee had been a starting point guard for the Cardinals for four seasons and played for a year in Germany before coach head Rick Pitino hired him as an assistant whose job responsibilities included on campus recruiting efforts. 'In Basketball programs,' Powell and Cady write,' highly touted potential recruits are wooed like young princes and treated like celebrities. 'Victories, national glory and millions of dollars sometimes will hinge on the decisions, or perhaps whims, of adolescents still in high school.' Powell says in the book that in 2010, she and McGee, then 23 years old, settled on a price for an evening of entertainment - $300 not including tips - and she went to work rounding up her troupe, which	1
John Key is dismissing Green Party criticism that his chief of staff attending a National Party fundraiser meant he was there as Prime Minister, not as an MP or party member, which breaches his own rules. Photo: RNZ / Diego Opatowski The Greens say it is another example of the wealthy having access to government in return for boosting National Party coffers, which must raise questions about a conflict of interest. Green Party co-leader Russel Norman said the Wellington dinner in September 2011 charged $3000 a head and since Mr Key was there with his top staffer, Wayne Eagleson, he was there as prime minister. Photo: RNZ Dr Norman said that was a breach of Mr Key's own directive to government ministers that they attend so-called Cabinet Club events only in their capacity as MPs or party members. He described it as fundamentally corrosive to democracy. But a written statement to Radio New Zealand News said Mr Key attended the dinner as leader of the National Party. "Mr Eagleson is responsible to Mr Key in both his capacity as Prime Minister and as Leader of the National Party. "In the time National has been in Government Mr Eagleson has attended a handful of National Party fundraising events." A spokesperson from his office earlier said the Greens' attacks on National Party fundraising highlighted their push for political parties to be state-funded because the Green Party has trouble raising funds. Dr Norman said Mr Eagleson was employed by the taxpayer and ministerial services to be the Prime Minister's chief of staff . "So there's no defence any more that the Prime Minister was simply there as an MP or as a National Party leader. He was there as the Prime Minister with his prime ministerial support staff with him." Dr Norman said serious questions over a possible conflict of interest had to be raised when people paid for access to the prime minister and the National Party benefited financially from that. John Key's office said such a fundraiser was completely within the law.	1

A new stereo mix of the album will be available as a single CD and as part of every other package. An expanded deluxe edition will be released digitally, as a two-CD set or two-LP vinyl package. A super deluxe six-disc box set will also be available. All three deluxe editions of Sgt. Pepper will boast previously unreleased complete takes of all 13 album tracks. The deluxe CD and digital versions will also include new stereo mixes: a previously unreleased instrumental take of "Penny Lane" and two unreleased takes of "Strawberry Fields Forever." The super deluxe box set come with all of the aforementioned CDs, plus 33 more recordings from the Sgt.

Ok everybody,sorry this has taken to long. Been busy with a lot of things going on and I forgot,. I had a new 2G Prius in for PDI and decided to give it a try. And guess what,I found out what we were doing wrong! Just one little step messes up everything. Here is the steps from the TSB and only applies to the 2G.1. Park the vehicle so as it is level,front to back and side to side.2. IgOn and make sure that "Trip A " is showing on the odo ( this is where we made a mistake).3. Power down.4. Keep your foot off the brake.5. Push in and hold down the Odo/Trip button.6. Push the Power button twice to IgOn ( not Ready mode ).7. Turn the Odo/Trip off then On 3 times in 5 seconds.8. Continue holding the Odo/Trip button until a 6 digit code appears.9. Release,then push again the Odo/Trip button for another 5 seconds. The 6 digit code will change to a 5 digit code.10. After the middle digit,of the 5 digit code,changes to "1" release the Odo/Trip button and the odometer will return to normal reading.Hope this clarifies the steps.	1
Reader Theora notified us about something interesting recently. A transcript has been released of the original Raiders of the Lost Ark story conference among Lucas, Spielberg and Kasdan. Here's a segment, which I've trimmed slightly for relevance to the kind of stuff we discuss here. G = George Lucas, S = Steven Spielberg, L = Lawrence Kasdan. For a while, they weren't sure what kind of girl to have as a counterpart to Indy… There was talk about a big name professor who taught Indy everything he knew. Then there was the idea about this German girl, and for the sake of expediency, Kasdan suggested that Indy instead have an affair with the mentor's daughter, which they loved. And then Lucas and Spielberg were off and running with ideas about how's she's been left in Peru and has this bar and is trying to get money together to get back to the States and loves (and resents) Indy to no end. In fact, Kasdan said he wanted Indy and this girl to already have a history when they meet because, "I like it if they already had a relationship at one point. Because then you don't have to build it." Hehehe… Then the discussion turned to how old Marion and Indy were at the time of the affair: G — I was thinking that this old guy could have been his mentor. He could have known this little girl when she was just a kid. Had an affair with her when she was eleven. L — And he was forty-two. G — He hasn't seen her in twelve years. Now she's twenty-two. It's a real strange relationship. S — She had better be older than twenty-two. G — He's thirty-five, and he knew her ten years ago when he was twenty-five and she was only twelve. It would be amusing to make her slightly young at the time. S — And promiscuous. She came onto him. G — Fifteen is right on the edge. I know it's an outrageous idea, but it is interesting. Once she's sixteen or seventeen it's not interesting anymore. But if she was fifteen and he was twenty-five and they actually had an affair the last time they met. And she was madly in love with him and he… S — She has pictures of him. And now consider the dialog of that scene in the film. INDY: I never meant to hurt you. MARION: I was a child! I was in love. INDY: You knew what you were doing. MARION: It was wrong. You knew it. INDY: Look, I did what I did. I don't expect you to be happy about it. But maybe we can do each other some good. MARION: Why start now? INDY: Shut up and listen for a second. I want that piece your father had. I've got money. MARION: How much?	1
I find this case to be kind of disturbing. Her accused rapist was investigated and it was found that there wasn't enough evidence to support her accusation. Now, there are certainly some questions about the validity of that investigation, but the point is that it was investigated by the relevant authorities and a decision was made. This has become essentially a "he said/she said" situation.  Do you have to agree with the decision? No. Does another investigation need to be conducted? Maybe. However, I don't think it's fair to drag someone through the mud when they've been cleared of any charges.  The focus should be on the university's poor handling of the case, but instead this project has caused a lot of damage to a potentially innocent person. Rape is a serious issue and if the accused did rape her then he deserves to be punished, but there needs to be evidence that it happened. The problem now is that collecting any kind of evidence of rape at this point is pretty much impossible. This whole case is a mess and I don't think that anyone involved is handling it properly.	1
Don't waste your ad dollars with an over-the-top sales pitch. Well-written copy follows these simple guidelines. February 16, 2009 14 min read Opinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own. This article has been excerpted from Kick-Ass Copywriting in 10 Easy Steps by Susan Gunelius, available from Entrepreneur Press . Whether you're a small-business owner, a medium-size business owner, an eBay seller, or simply trying to break into the copywriting industry, understanding the fundamentals of writing sales-oriented copy and put you on a path to success. At its core, copywriting is another device in a business' marketing toolbox. Well-written copy can make or break an ad or marketing piece. With that in mind, copywriting can equate to either well-spent advertising investments or a waste of advertising dollars. Many people misinterpret the uniqueness of effective copywriting. I can't count the number of times I've heard freelance writers say they want to shift from article writing to copywriting as if it's simply an extension of their existing abilities. Copywriting does come naturally to some people, but for most, it's a foreign landscape they do not know how to navigate. Copywriting is about more than writing the hard sell sales letter that many short copywriting courses offer. In fact, I cringe when I see those over-the-top sales letters, which do little more than provide an ugly representation of copywriting, sales and marketing.  Well-crafted copywriting doesn't need to beat a person over the head. It doesn't have to drown in bold typeface and capitalization. The message should stand on its own without an overabundance of heavy-handed sales language and design embellishments. I associate many sales letters that are guilty of this technique with a writer who doesn't truly understand the basic purpose of copywriting. However, successful copywriting can be achieved in 10 easy steps. Consider Your Copy Motivate your customer to buy with these 10 copywriting steps: 1. Exploit your product's benefits  2. Exploit your competition's weaknesses  3. Know your audience  4. Communicate W.I.I.F.M. (What's In It For Me?)  5. Focus on "you," not "we"  6. Understand your medium  7. Avoid T.M.I. (Too Much Information)  8. Include a call to action  9. C.Y.A. (Cover Your Ass)  10. Proofread 1. Exploit your product's benefits. The first step of the copywriting outline is the foundation for your advertising campaigns. A benefit is the value of your product to a customer. In other words, a benefit is what the product can do for a customer or how the product can help a customer. You need to put into words the reasons your product is the best available and better than your competitors' products based on the added value it provides to your customers. The key to success is for you to fully understand all the benefits of your product. Only then can you ensure that the audience knows them and can relate to them. 2. Exploit your competition's weaknesses. To write compelling copy, it is essential that you know what differentiates your product from the competition. Once you know your competitors' weaknesses, you must make sure your audience knows them and understands why buying your competitors' products would be a terrible mistake. Get started by thoroughly researching your competition and understanding what they offer in terms of products and services. Next, list the elements of their offerings that are inferior to your own. Feel free to tear the competition apart but be realistic in your comparisons. You want to be able to support your claims if you are challenged. 3. Know your audience. Every person in the world is not going to see every ad in the world. Each ad has a specific audience that will see it, and it's the marketer's job to find the best placement to ensure the target audience will see it. For example, an ad for skateboards placed in a local senior citizen housing association newsletter is not likely to generate a lot of sales. In fact, it would be a waste of advertising dollars. The target audience for skateboards is teenagers or young adults. The vast majority of senior citizens do not use skateboards, and it is not a product category in which they typically purchase gifts. Before you buy ad space, make sure you're spending your money in the right place to get the biggest bang for your buck in terms of exposure and building awareness of your product or service. First, take the time to research your customers thoroughly. In most businesses, 20 percent of customers are responsible for 80 percent of sales (this is called the 80/20 rule in case you're curious about the official marketing terminology for this phenomenon). That 20	1
An 18-year-old driver has been charged with causing the death of a man who was killed when two vehicles fleeing police smashed into each other. Horrified eyewitnesses say they saw the driver of one of the cars killed instantly in the collision, which police say followed the earlier assault and robbery of a 50-year-old man in in Bicton about 6.30pm on Tuesday.  Police say the man was a 28-year-old Willagee resident who'd been involved in the attack along with an 18-year-old man from Munster, who had fled the scene in another car before crashing into his partner in crime. The scene in Bicton on Tuesday evening. Photo: Fran Rimrod. One of the offenders is understood to have left in a Holden Astra and the others in a Holden Commodore. Police responding to the call tried to stop the Holden Commodore on Point Walter Road, but gave chase when their attempts failed.	1
Colorado Medical Marijuana Qualification Who Qualifies for Medicinal Marijuana in Colorado November 07, 2000, Colorado voters approved Ballot Amendment 20, effectively removing state-level criminal penalties on the use, possession and cultivation of marijuana, by patients possessing a written recommendation from their certified physician, advising that he or she may "benefit from the medical use of marijuana". The Colorado Board of Health has created a set of rules and regulations which create a confidential statewide registry of medical marijuana patients and caregivers with ID cards for all registered patients. Under Amendment 20, patients, physicians and primary or alternate caregivers have an affirmative defense to criminal prosecution under the state's marijuana laws. Colorado patients and their caregivers may possess no more than two ounces of a usable form of marijuana, and more than six marijuana plants, with three or fewer being mature, flowering plants. What Ailments Qualify For Medical Cannabis in Colorado Patients in Colorado diagnosed with one of the following severe, debilitating, or life-threatening medical conditions, are afforded legal protection under the Colorado Medical Marijuana law, as per Ballot Amendment 20: Cancer; Glaucoma; HIV/AIDS; Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) A chronic or debilitating disease or medical condition other than HIV, cancer or glaucoma; or treatment for such conditions, which produces for a specific patient one or more of the following, and for which, in the professional opinion of the patient's physician, such condition or conditions may reasonably be alleviated by the medical use of marijuana: cachexia; severe pain; severe nausea; seizures, including those that are characteristic of epilepsy; persistent muscle spasms, including those that are characteristic of multiple sclerosis; and other condition, as subject to the approval of the Colorado Board of Health. * Patients and physician alike may petition to include other medical conditions that would benefit from the medical use of marijuana, in the event the patient's condition is found to be invalid by the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment.	1
Cops will have to take "extreme care" to avoid jail-breaking the latest iPhones as the US government will fine manufacturers for breaking its digital security. Apple has been criticised for designing and releasing its latest smartphone without any security measures. Apple has defended the iPhone 6 for carrying out some of its advanced security measures, but will be fined if it continues to fail that test. The Federal Communications Commission and FBI will be allowed to fine companies as much as $25,000 (£17,800) for not patching bugs after they are announced. The FCC, under a new ruling from president Obama , will allow fines of $1,500 per device over the same "bug bounty". There have been multiple hacks into iPhone 6 smartphones this year in the wake of the 2013 revelation that the device could be unlocked with a passcode lock. However, security experts have criticised Apple's software and device for not patching its bugs to prevent them becoming the latest weapon in the fight for online privacy. US congressman Ted Lieu warned, "We're watching the FBI and the government take an old security issue — cracking open a closed device — and turn it into a brand new security issue with the advent of a new device." His Democratic colleague Senator Mark Warner echoed a similar sentiment, saying: "If the FBI is successful with this program, it could make it much more difficult for law-abiding Americans to protect their privacy." However, one leading security researcher said he believed the government was not seeking Apple's help to fight off a criminal. "They don't see the need for Apple — they don't see much of a market for new iPhones now," said Matthew Green. Green believes the government wants new devices because it is concerned a new smartphone with facial recognition capabilities might become a tool for terrorists. "These are not necessarily criminals — these are extremists," he said. "If you have someone with a gun strapped to their body — if you want the FBI to stop that, then you want to lock that phone, and then lock it."	0
The latest edition of the German Football Hall of Fame ballot has been released, and the results are as expected: 19 out of the 37 candidates will eventually become legends within the game. Some good, some bad. The big takeaway from the German Football Hall of Fame ballot is that one out of a hundred will end up being a legend. I guess that makes it better than the American version of their Hall of Fame, but the American version still has a bunch of legends who were not enshrined. With a new election, perhaps the American version will become more competitive like the German version. That being said, there are some not-so-inspiring choices on the ballot. What's the one thing you would like to see become a German legend? If your answer was: "Hamburg's Jurgen Klinsmann" it's time to put that dream to rest. His six championships with the USMNT doesn't make up for his failure to win on the pitch. The Germans are going to have to wait to see what is a realistic goal for Klinsmann, and if he's willing to give it in the next election. Jurgen Klinsmann is one of the few players to win an international trophy while still wearing a US shirt, but he fell short of the expectations during his time with the national team. Is there one German legend you would like to see honored in the Hall of Fame? For one, there is Thomas Kraft. Kraft was a former German World Cup champion, winner of both the UEFA European Championship and European Championship. His only two World Cups were two of the five World Cup's that were held in Germany. It would be great to see his name engraved in the German Hall of Fame. Kraft would also be a great tribute for those who are suffering from Alzheimer's disease. Other than that, I would love to see a German side that does not play the beautiful game and goes for a traditional, German style of soccer. Who has the finest mustache in football history? Hamburg's Wolfgang Stark, better known as the Red Baron. His mustache looks like it could be ripped straight out of the opening scene of a 1930s spy movie. He also took part in an air strike. He is also one of the greatest goal scorers in Bundesliga history. What is the best German World Cup trophy? It will no-doubt include the European Cup, and the German champions of 2006. Although, the German champions of 1974 or 1999 would also qualify. I do think though that the Germans do deserve at least one World Cup trophy of theirs. Especially the 1974 side that had Schmeichel, Neuer, Wohlfahrt, Löw, Heynckes, Zorniger and Bierhoff as players. What will it take for Jurgen Klinsmann to become a German legend? If he can make the final of the Euro 2012 final, that is a solid first step. If he can get to the quarterfinal of Euro 2016, that will be another big step. However, as long as Klinsmann is the coach of the USMNT, even if he never wins a league trophy, I still believe that the Germans will be his biggest admirers. Do you think Jurgen Klinsmann will reach the ballot for his second attempt? Let us know in the comments below!	0
Dangerous animals, especially snakes, in a car are a safety hazard. If there are loose snakes, they can easily strike. The fact that a snake is loose is the most common reason for incidents, making car safety a more complicated situation.  A simple way to avoid the issue is to keep any loose snake in your car under proper control. This will also prevent the snake from becoming entangled with something and getting run over. To learn the best ways to keep your snake, you can refer to the article below that talks about snakes in cars. It also details the best car snake containment. Keep your dog's housemate, not the dog, under control Make sure any stray dogs inside the house are kept under control. If they come close to the house, use the "stay away" command to keep them inside. Do not allow them to jump in and out of the house. Learn safe ways to contain your snake In certain situations, it is easy to have a snake become tangled up. If you have a snake that has found its way to a car, you should first make sure they are not accidentally entangled in the car (this can sometimes be impossible). The best way to deal with snakes that have gotten into the car is to control the situation. If you decide to get a snake in the car: If a snake is able to get inside the car it is probably not a good idea, for various reasons. If you are concerned about your safety and the safety of others, you must leave the snake in a safe location where it is not going to damage the car, or injure any person. First of all, the snake has a bad reputation around people. People tend to react badly when they hear of a snake in a car. The snake is not going to look any different from any person, except for its appearance. Second of all, a snake will also strike without your warning, while trying to get out of the car. Many people will try to grab a snake from inside. This behavior can cause serious injury to the snake, which could cause damage to the motor vehicle. If a snake has not become entangled, it is a good idea to do the following: Check for loose snakes before going out Remove snakes from car if possible If your snake has become ensnared in a rope, trap it with a sticky substance If your snake seems to be in a dangerous situation, you should call wildlife agencies When handling a snake, try to avoid being too rough. This could cause permanent damage to your skin. Do not try to control a snake, unless it is attacking or in the process of attacking anything. If this happens, move back, but keep moving when possible. If this is not possible, make sure to remove the stuck parts quickly. Do not attempt to use a snake tongs to try and free a snake that has no part in its mouth. Do not attempt to clean your snake if it is entangled in a snake bag. This will only weaken your snake and give it a chance to escape. The following are some helpful tips: If the snake is stuck and cannot escape, you should: Make sure it is in a secure location Find a safe place to place it to keep it out of your sight. This should allow you to see the snake clearly and ensure that this situation doesn't turn into a dangerous situation Place the snake inside a large plastic bag, with the head inside, and the body on the outside. Do not wrap the snake to tightly Make sure no loose parts are inside the snake. If a branch or part of your rope gets in the bag, these could seriously affect the snake's safety by breaking off and becoming entangled with your rope Place the bag inside a vehicle to keep the snake out of sight If you are concerned about the safety of other passengers, ask them to call an animal control service or animal shelter.

Sometimes dogs may bark to release stress. However, barking during a car ride is extremely dangerous. If a dog bickers while in motion, he can hit things, hit bystanders or injure themselves. If a dog bickers at a loud volume, it will be extremely loud. Also, a dog may be injured if he bites an object while in	0
I started my first MLP story way back in 2014 as a joke (well, not really, I've been writing since I was seven). I had an original idea about a princess who just so happened to be the Pink Ranger and how she would go on adventure and save everyone. It was more of a fanfic and didn't meet with an audience like I would have liked, but it was a fun, quick story that got posted on my tumblr account and a couple folks that liked it seemed to want more. I wrote in various places, and eventually that got started over on FF.net, but I never got around to finishing it. However, in March of 2016 someone started a new MLP story (one I hadn't heard of) called "Pinkie Pie and the Princess Academy" and I realized it was an MLP fanfic that I could rework into a full story! So the story I told in those posts is here as an unfinished story: "The Lost Angel of Rainbow Boulevard" originally posted under the name "Pinkie Pie and the Princess Academy" on FF.net. I originally started it because I just wanted to write something silly and silly, but now I realize I want to write something serious, and if I could finish the story it would be amazing to see what that would be like! That said, if this gets popular I'll try to upload it to AO3! Update: The story was recently re-posted on FF.net once again, but it's a very different story, so just go there now! Now you have a chance to read it! "Pinkie Pie, You're in the Library?!" The library was not the normal library that ponies use. It was actually a magical library, the size of a small home, that only ponies lived there. Only the most special of books could be found there, and only Twilight, Applejack and Fluttershy knew how to use it. Once inside the library, a bookcase opened to reveal an open book. All the way at the front of the bookcase were two bookshelves with shelves and bookcases all of their own. On each shelf were books. On each shelf were books. "What do you mean you don't know how to use this library?" said Twilight Sparkle. "We've been talking about this all week, Twilight. We're just going to have to do it before we go inside." Fluttershy gave her sister a disapproving glare. "No way, Twilight! You never said you knew how to use it. The library is right out front, remember? When you guys were having your little magical session. I know where to find your magic pages." "Okay, you're just trying to piss me off," said Twilight, annoyed. "Don't you realize that this is just a one time thing? You can't just expect me to use the library for the rest of my life. It's just a book, right there, that only we ponies live in. And I don't think I'll make it through the night!" "What are you talking about, Twilight?" asked Applejack. "The library is right there. There's a big sign on it that says 'Library.'" "Yes, and what exactly does that mean?" asked Pinkie Pie. "I mean come on, Fluttershy... I've been a library fan for as long as I can remember, and I've read all the books. I used to use the library every day when I was a filly. What does that even mean?" "It means it's right there in front of us," said Fluttershy. "And you're just making it up." "So what do we do, then?" asked Twilight again. "We can just walk right in like normal ponies would, right? Right?" "Right, right, wrong!" said Pinkie. "Don't you want to check the bookcases first? You'll learn how to use them later, after you've got a better idea of what to do. In the meantime, we have to just walk right in. That's what you do in the library all the time, right?" "Right, right!" said Twilight. "Come on," said Pinkie, "it doesn't really take all that long." " "Fine, fine, I'll check those shelves next. I promise I'll just stay out of the way and keep an eye open so you can do your thing." "Okay, Pinkie," said Fluttershy, "no more arguing! Let's just get out there and see what happens!" Fluttershy started to walk to the door, but a voice called out, "Hold it right there!" and a figure with an orange mane came running from the right side of the bookcases. "Fluttershy," said Twilight,	0

We were delighted to discover that a group of young people who had come to the US for a one-day summer program would end up becoming our most dedicated students and partners. These students are members of the youth movement Project NIA, and it's their commitment to the social justice cause that inspires us. On August 14 the US State Department officially recognized an organization called Young Democrats of America as an official political organization, just three days before their student summer program wrapped up. This recognition gave the group the legal ability to register with the Federal Election Commission as a political party, and in turn run for US Congress (in the age of Obama there is no doubt they will). As we prepared to start the next stages of the youth movement the question arose: what is the most compelling example of youth-led political change we could provide? What makes a political change accomplished in the United States so different from what happened in Greece, Ireland, or Portugal? Our answer was simple – youth-led social movements work. Our students came home after their program and told us what they learned. Here are four things we learned from them about how to organize a grassroots movement. 1. Youth movement groups don't just come and go. We are lucky that they do, and this will continue as long as we are ready and willing to give them the resources and support to keep on going. Young Democrats of America (YDA), which the State Department endorsed as a "Democratic Youth Organization," came together in a couple weeks during the 2012 elections. The group, founded in 1987 in San Francisco, was the only progressive youth group of its kind (like many, though, YDA has had some problems in the recent years, even closing down several times) that used social media to generate support from ordinary voters throughout the country. That, of course, only works if the group's members are politically active in some kind of way that generates the kinds of responses such groups usually experience during normal elections. Our students explained the organization's unique method of campaigning by taking volunteers and building a list of those willing to volunteer for the effort. Through a series of focus groups (the group's members had done focus groups together prior to the 2012 campaigns), these student activists started to understand why this tactic worked. When they got the volunteer list they found many who were willing to run for office on local and state level as "independent" (a name that was not actually included on their voting registration cards) – but they were not willing to commit to such political commitments to get them through a registration process. The group, rather than waiting for all those who were willing to run to sign up with them, decided to focus on gathering enough of the 1 million individual members of the association before the elections to get elected on their own merits – and for them to get voted in by the other members of the association in a runoff. The result? Fourteen of YDA's 16 candidates won, many by impressive margins. 2. The power of grassroots organizers matters very much in the US. At a time when youth activists and organizations are more likely to be seen as radicals, or even as radicals working without any other organizational structure, YDA, with its focus on building local and state groups, was able to capture the imagination of many American voters. Their candidates were more likely to get elected, particularly in places where the candidate had the most local support. This is why groups that do not have a political vision or organizing structure are more successful in elections. Young Democrats are less likely to run for office in Europe, where they are often not seen as radicals within political groups and more likely to run with an existing party. In this way, YDA's ability to take a different approach to mobilizing voters may have resulted in a different outcome in the US than would have been possible if YDA had been led by seasoned politicians. 3. The biggest reason that political campaigns matter is because the power of the ballot. Political campaigns are often portrayed as a "money race" between candidates, or perhaps a "lobbyist war" between political parties, each vying to win more money on the political market. Our students pointed out to us that many people do not think about the importance of voting. However, in the US a presidential election that is not won by at least 15% is considered a loss. These results give us hope that the influence of young people in campaigns can have an important influence on how public policy is made. If they have the power to elect their representatives to office, the ideas and initiatives that come out of those meetings will have a lot more power than what any given election can have. The power of the people and the willingness of organizations to collaborate on these sorts of issues make the American political system unique on the world scene. It would have been easy for YDA to just go home and wait for a political change to happen, but they worked with other organizations as well to build their organizational network and to develop	0
This was never the sort of thing that he thought he'd be spending the rest of his life living on the dole. That was a lot of money back then, but not really the sort of money one spends on the dole: You'd never make rent on that, no one was going to loan you the money, even if you were a real genius at the sort of math that gets you on the dole. So he didn't. Or rather, he never thought he'd be spending the rest of his life living on the dole: He wasn't that hungry. And if he had to go out and earn it, he would have to find a way to buy something with it, so that maybe he wouldn't have to go out and earn it. He hadn't been that hungry, now hadn't he, so he wouldn't keep looking for money that wasn't there. He'd spent his life paying a lot of taxes, trying to get ahead, paying for all of this, and yet he still had a couple of grand in his checking account, and that was something, even if you took into account taxes and all of that? And that would be it, he'd have enough. But now he no longer needed a job to raise his family, since he wouldn't need one to get by and survive. But he never really thought that he'd have the money: He'd always been more of a thinker than a doer, that was his thing. You thought about stuff, figured out a solution or two, and then you worked to actually realize that solution, or not try until you were certain that you could. He'd always been that way. But the old man would have none of that. Not for him, he wouldn't. He wanted a job and he wouldn't be denied it no matter what. He'd been doing this for decades now, and there wasn't a day that went by that he wasn't getting paid. He'd found his calling, that was what he'd been told, that was what he'd been trained to do, so that he would earn enough money for his family, for himself, so that he could eat, and have enough left over to buy the things he could never put away before he came home, so that he wouldn't be stuck with a debt he couldn't pay, so that he wouldn't be dead to the world once his family died, so that he could go on living as he always had, like he always should have. He'd kept that up since he was a kid when he'd been making those same arguments to the doctor who'd told him that he might someday need to work a little because he was so smart. But that was all he'd ever really wanted: Just the illusion of hope, if he could only remember what that was all about. He'd always been so stubborn about it. He'd been told he was special, too, too smart to go to that college, too smart to get that job, too smart to find a way to pay his parents back with his own money, too smart to work at all after graduation. His dad had told him it was stupid of him to believe in him, anyway, but even then – even then, he hadn't really gotten the idea that he was special. He didn't even think he had any talent, or that the person he was going to meet would appreciate him. Why shouldn't he get the help he needed? There was still time to get something, to be an adult, to get in, to work that magic trick that would get him out of his old life, and he'd tried so hard to become the adult that he thought his parents had told him he'd be when he was older and it was still happening. It's a long time ago that he realized he wasn't going to be an adult, though, and that he was stuck here. He wasn't going to graduate and try to find a job in a different field, get his own house, and the money that would enable that, because then he'd be paying that debt back on top of everything else he had from school, money he couldn't actually spend unless he somehow managed to scrape together enough money to actually pay his interest back on all of it. He didn't even have any money left. He'd always been so persistent. So dedicated. So determined. So convinced that he could change something. Make enough money to get ahead without having to work a job, with enough to live on until his family got to retirement. It was almost as if he'd been raised to be this way, in that way he was determined to be better than he had been. He hated looking back on all of those years. The years that had taken away his friends, his career, his family. He hated them all, and still had them within him. He hated those moments when he'd thought he'd figured it all out and	0
The United States should not accept refugees from any of the Middle East countries hit by the violence, with President Obama taking aim at Iran, Qatar and Jordan on Thursday. "It is not too late to make sure that we don't allow sectarian conflict, and that we don't enable the wrong people to dominate the conversation when we talk about how we address refugees and displaced populations," Mr Obama said during a press conference. "At the same time ... we don't want a slippery slope," he said. "We shouldn't be making it easier for people to come to the United States and threaten us," the US president declared in his comments. The White House would not confirm his estimate that 12.5 million Syrians were now refugees, but the news service Reuters said on Monday that it was based on a senior US official who was in charge of the crisis. The White House has previously confirmed that 10 million Syrians are displaced within the country, including more than four million inside its borders. The White House has been criticised for its lack of action to help Syria, with Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump calling for "a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country's representatives can figure out what is going on". Last month, the State Department announced it had rejected two refugee applications from Syrians - including one based on Mr Trump's suggestion. In February, President Obama pledged to admit 100,000 Syrian refugees by the end of this year - a move that the State Department did not take up until this month. Shape Created with Sketch.

1) What is the biggest single item of the current climate debate? I think that's a pretty good question because there's a lot to this question, but let's just go ahead and list them out. A) The carbon-capture-and-storage (CCS) scheme. B) Methane leakage (a bit of a misnomer, as many countries are actually phasing out coal-fired power plants). C) The carbon tax. To me, most of the arguments in the debate have been rather muddled, to put it mildly. Many people who are against CCS tend to favor it, but those who don't tend to oppose it. As the former coal industries man, I feel quite strongly that CCS is important. I don't think we should let this opportunity slip by; I've got a few problems with it, and I think there's some reasons why it might be a bad idea. But I also want to get the discussion going. We could have been talking about other things if we had gone that route. But here, we're here talking about climate change, which is going to get a lot worse before it gets better. CCS is clearly key. I'm sorry if it doesn't seem quite right to be focused on this one particular issue right now; I'm thinking about that later on in this discussion. But it's the biggest in the context of what's to have to happen. The carbon tax has another major issue that needs to be addressed this week. 2) How does the climate change debate fit into the budget and the debt ceiling? If you ask that question, people get to choose their own answer. But this isn't what the debate is about. Climate change is going to cause a crisis with grave economic consequences that will be felt for the next decades, decades, decades, if we wait long enough. That problem is going to have to be fixed, and it's going to be hard. I'm not going to pretend it's easy. I do, however, support the need for the government to spend on climate change. A couple of things. First, some people don't quite grasp the difference between climate and weather, and climate and the weather of the future. Second, the "fiscal cliff" will hurt in the short term, but not in the long term. A couple of things have to happen first if the U.S. is to survive a future downturn: Cut the deficits Reduce the debt There's no need to do anything big like raising taxes because the budget problems will be solved if they're done in the short term. We just need to balance the budget. 3) The "fiscal cliff" is bad news because it shows a lack of leadership It's good news that the economy is not growing at a rate we should expect, because a growth-stagnant economy is a sign of too much slack in the economy. It doesn't matter whether the slack consists solely of slack in the labor market, or if there's slack in the market in general. Let me give an example. Let's pretend that at a given time of year, the prices for things like eggs and butter are at levels that are higher than they are this time last year. You know what's going to happen? Demand for those things will be stronger than supply. If there's less slack in the economy, then you don't have a recession of the sort we're seeing. But if there are slack, then demand for things like butter and eggs will eventually crash. So there's plenty of slack in the economy. The market might well adjust to the higher prices, but that's a temporary event. That is the situation we're in. We'd still know that our economy was on a downward trajectory if we were to compare it to other countries around the world. But we don't see it that way, because we aren't getting any signals from the markets that something needs to change. This isn't simply a function of insufficient demand — we can easily compensate for shortages in goods like butter and eggs by raising their prices. It's a function of the fact that we don't even have a reasonable sense of how slack there actually is. There's a lesson there. Countries with more slack are going to have to think about doing something about it. It can't just be a matter of waiting for it to show. As to whether it can be done, that's still up in the air. 4) The "fiscal cliff" shows that Republicans and Democrats don't have much confidence in the economy Well, we can't wait around for the markets to adjust. But not doing so will just cause us to miss the economy — it could also lead to the markets continuing to struggle through the rest of the year, possibly increasing the risk of a crash. There's	0
What is it? It's a video game that's a combination of a game, a movie theater and a nightclub. Where can I play it? The game can be played on the web. What's the difference between a movie theater and a game? The theater and the game are made of the same medium (i.e., screens). Movies and games are two completely different forms of entertainment and one is interactive, while the other is non-interactive. The game is primarily an event that features entertainment. Movies are an event that can occur in nearly any venue – any time of the day or any night. Is the game like other game consoles like PS2 and XBOX? The first games to use the "motion-capture" technology were the first "motion-capture" games. Motion-capture technologies are used to add "interactivity" to the game by creating a 3D model of how your character moves. These technologies work by using infrared or other electromagnetic technology to detect a player's movements and the game must use this information to animate the character. These games were designed to allow for more realism than games of the time, but they also created an opportunity for game developers to create completely new genres of games that we now call "action" games, "fighting games", "adventure games", "role-playing games", and so on. These were not created for entertainment – these games were designed to entertain you. What makes this game special? There is a lot we can learn from watching a movie. For example, you can see when a character makes eye contact or turns his or her head to indicate something. Watching a movie also provides us with new tools that we can use to make a product. Video games can teach us a lot about how to create a great game. What will be in it? There will be a game called "World of Warcraft". It will allow players to create a character and then explore the world using the in-game interface. They can do so by exploring different parts of the "world", leveling up, obtaining items, and completing quests. Some of the aspects that will be in the game include: "realism", "choice", "embellishment", "elevation", "action", "immersion," "dynamic" (e.g., a battle might be played out in a different way than in an action movie). How do we play it? On the web: You can play it through a browser at youtube.com Playing it on your favorite device: You can play Warcraft through your app Playing it on your favorite device or with a controller: You can play through your own home or office computer or phone. It's a social experience. What's the game going to cost? It will be sold through Blizzard for $80. What's your current goal? We don't have an amount of money in mind. We know it will take at least a few thousand dollars to make this game so it's the minimum we need to get started. Who will play it? The game will be made for gamers. What's the team like? We are about eight people from diverse backgrounds. We have come together because we are passionate about games and we want to make a game that can really entertain people. What was your inspiration for the game? There were many inspirations for Warcraft that shaped the game. Our primary inspiration is the films the game is based on, but we also have some elements of real history in game. We started out by thinking about fantasy fantasy war games, then we started to think about what kind of game we could make that we could see ourselves playing in real life. In that process we came up with a concept known as World of Warcraft and we had a lot of fun playing around with it and playing with the technology we have. Why were you interested in this project? With World of Warcraft, we wanted to make a game that allows people to explore and experience the game the way that they might have seen it presented in the films. We love the mythology and the world of Warcraft was the ideal game to take our inspiration and apply it to a video game form. In addition to a great gameplay experience it will be great to make a game that is based off real game technology instead of having to wait until 20 years from now for something to be done. Where can I buy Warcraft? You can purchase Warcraft from the Blizzard web site. To see a short video, watch the trailer from this month's BlizzCon:	0

How did a bunch of computer nerds accidentally turn into super heroes and become the greatest supervillains and heroes the world has ever seen? In this video, director Matt Berenson breaks down how they did it. This is a long one, so keep in mind there are spoilers. As many of you know, the comic book villain The Green Goblin was created as an amalgamation of several characters and ideas, including a scientist, his assistant, and a spy. He's never truly been explained in great detail, not because of the character, but because of the character's existence, and I'm pretty sure that's why there hasn't been a Green Goblin movie yet. Advertisement In the comics, the character came in the form of a scientist who got out of trouble in the 1940s, and ended up marrying the woman who had created him. That's who he then impregnated, and then created some sort of hybrid monster from that. He didn't really do any real plotting or writing for his own character, and just sort of went about his normal work day with the Green Goblin. The whole thing was pretty much completely ripped off and made more ridiculous when a comic book publisher was hired by Stan Lee to create the real story. The real story was that the Green Goblin had just graduated from college and was working as a writer in the Marvel offices. He didn't realize he was an interdimensional being from a parallel world (like the other comics villains, actually) until he was arrested and brought in front of the grand jury by the government. He learned that Spider-Man, the greatest hero of all time, had just become a hero of justice. He decided it was his duty to use the power of his Goblin ring on this person. In Spider-Man, Peter Parker became the first hero to actually fight a supervillain the government never even knew existed. And that's when he discovered that the Green Goblin was actually a real character who had lived in the Marvel offices for years. They had decided to give him a new name just to be ironic. Advertisement A year later they came up with a way to bring him back and he was reborn as a superhero called The Green Goblin. He became one of the top super-spies of his time, but then his wife died, so he went to her grave without her blessing and started a new life. As a superhero, he became obsessed with making sure Spider-Man was arrested for his crimes. Finally, it became clear he had no choice but to go full-on supervillain again. This time he teamed up with other supervillains to stop Spider-Man. It was at this time that Spider-Man went insane and started doing a lot of crime in his own comic book. And the Goblin was the one who was responsible for that. Advertisement He took a lot of punishment from Spidey, but eventually Spider-Man's mind was destroyed, and the Spider-Tracers began tracking him down and capturing him. After the government finally caught up with the Green Goblin, the Green Goblin decided it would be ironic to do an arrest so close to the end of his own life. He decided to escape from prison using his new alias: Doctor Octopus. And here's where things get pretty weird, because in the comic books he uses his "Octopus tentacles" to create a prison and then he sets a trap for Spidey. It's like Spider-Man went to a comic book convention and suddenly his favorite villains started becoming his friends. Advertisement The Goblin has the power of Spider-Man's nemesis the Green Goblin, but his real powers came off as a few "dancing with the stars" and super-speed tricks. So the Green Goblin's true power was in manipulating the minds of others and using them as puppets to his will. The Green Goblin was basically like all the other villains you'd find in the Avengers movies. He used his power to make life difficult for Spider-Man, but eventually the two villains got into an epic fight where the two super heroes destroyed each other. After that they put a "trap" out that they thought would defeat the Green Goblin. When it was destroyed, the Green Goblin escaped and ran to another dimension, where his powers were so powerful he decided Spider-Man was the problem and he took out the human race. Advertisement Here's the thing: the Green Goblin did not actually destroy the human race. Even though Doc Ock destroyed the Fantastic Four, Spider-Man and the rest of the humans were still alive. If the Green Goblin had destroyed the other dimension, we would never have been shown the Fantastic Four get back together. Instead, the Green Goblin and Doc Ock ended up in a third dimension where they were forced to use each other's brain waves to communicate, but it was so powerful the Green Goblin destroyed the entire universe and all the	0

The U.S. Navy's new amphibious transport dock (LPD-17) is almost in production and some U.S. cities are considering bidding for contracts to house its crew. The LPD-17 is based on shipbuilder General Dynamics Electric Boat's USS New Orleans-class LPD amphibious assault ships, and is to be delivered in 2018. General Dynamic has already contracted with one shipyard in Alabama for up to eight more LPD-17's -- but a second shipyard has yet to be selected, and many US cities are talking to shipyards about hosting them. "Some cities are bidding for the first few deliveries to be delivered of the LPD-17s. This will have tremendous logistical effects on our local communities," said Lt. General Chris Kolender, chief of naval operations for U.S. Northern Command. "We're looking for communities where we can deliver the LPDs and take advantage, if they're able, of the local workforce," he added. The amphibious assault ship is capable of carrying a complement of 7,700 Marines and 1,350 soldiers on a long deployment. The ships have been under construction for a number of years with General Dynamics Electric Boat finishing the first three ships in 2011. General Dynamics Electric Boat is working on the first three LPD-17s for the U.S. Navy. There were no bids yet for those services. The shipyard in Mobile, Alabama, is also in the running for the future order -- where the company is also building a second LPD-17 -- though Kolender said Mobile's proposal has yet to be considered. In fact, there's no guarantee that this second shipyard will even be selected to become a "homeport" for the U.S. Navy's amphibious assault ships. The U. S. Navy will continue to operate the New Orleans-class attack ships as normal. The next two LPD-17s were expected to be delivered by late 2016, however that project is now projected to ship "late 2017," according to Kolender. General Dynamics Electric Boat announced plans to build the LPD-17 and other amphibious assault ships in 2010. The first three vessels would then have reached full service around 2021 -- but General Dynamics Electric Boat recently canceled development of the Navy's LPD-class amphibious transports, citing a lack of financing from the government. The LPD-17 amphibious assault ships will cost more than $4 billion dollars apiece. General Dynamics Electric Boat is also building the USS Milwaukee-class LPD-17 and the USS New York-class LPD-26 for the same Navy.	0
The FBI has on four occasions in the last year received and processed Freedom of Information Act requests for information about the Clinton Foundation. Four different judges have found that none of the public information requests was "sufficiently specific to constitute a FOIA exemption," according to the Associated Press. Yet the FBI continues its routine practice of releasing little information about the Clinton Foundation. The FBI has been under fire for months about its handling of former Secretary Clinton's emails. In March, it recommended no charges be brought against Clinton for lying under oath at a congressional hearing, which she later denied. The Clinton emails scandal also continues to hamper the presidential campaign of Sen. Bernie Sanders. The Clinton Foundation is one of the biggest contributors to the Clinton Foundation and has attracted criticism for accepting foreign donations while Hillary Clinton governed the State Department. Despite its ongoing problems, the Clinton Foundation still lists Clinton as a trustee and lists two of its largest donors on its website as CGI (Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations) and Deutsche Bank. The Clinton Foundation is also mired in an unrelated lawsuit related to its acceptance of donations from governments for projects in the Middle East. The foundation agreed to pay the State Department $10 million after revelations that some of the money came from government contractors, but the State Department did not press the issue, instead asking only for a pledge of $500,000 to reimburse agency salaries. In a letter to the attorney general last year, the Foundation promised to refrain from receiving foreign governmental donations, but did not commit to not take government money from future projects. The Clinton Foundation received two separate FOIA requests regarding its foreign donations over the course of 2015. But the FBI withheld information in at least one case. In May 2015, the FOIA requester went through the request line by line, seeking information about the Clinton Foundation's ties to countries such as Algeria and Saudi Arabia. Each of the requests were denied. In June 2015, a different FOIA requester sought information about the Clinton Foundation's operations around the global AIDS crisis. This FOIA request, too, was denied. In December 2015, another federal FOIA requester made a request related to the Clinton Foundation's activities around the global humanitarian crisis in the Darfur region of Sudan. It was denied. The FOIA requester then sought further information within the agency that seemed to shed some light of the allegations against the Clinton Foundation, and the FBI denied the request again. But this time, the judge noted that the FBI had acknowledged it had received the requests, albeit just once. "It is not plausible to believe that this FBI agent did not see or receive the FOIA requests," wrote Judge Andrew Hanen. "Each of the FOIA requests is specific enough to constitute a FOIA exception. In all, four judges have found that none of these FOIA requests is 'sufficiently specific to constitute a FOIA exemption.'" The Associated Press reports: The FBI received each of the four requested records from the Clinton Foundation. In three cases, an FBI agent noted there were insufficient details or documents, or both, to determine whether the information could be turned over. But the FBI did not explain why its agents found these cases insufficient when they had previously cited them as complete. The FBI did not immediately return our request for comment. The FBI has repeatedly come under fire in recent months for its handling of Clinton emails amid the presidential campaign. Former FBI agents have said that the agency was too slow to release documents related to its investigation into Clinton's email server or questions about whether she lied in Congress after she testified under oath that she never sent or received emails that were marked classified. It seems to be that the FBI has not only violated Freedom of Information Act, but perhaps it has breached its own policies, as well.	0
It takes very little to drive a vehicle off the road, but when you combine it with extreme weather, you're bound to wind up in a crash. It can happen even if you don't feel anything unusual; and while it can happen to the best of us, it's more often a result of bad decisions, not natural laws. Whether your car is running great or not will not make the difference to how it ends up. Check your insurance company's policy and see what its minimum coverage is if you're hit by another driver that you know is driving safely and within their limits. What is covered? Your policy will pay up to $100,000 for damage to your vehicles and/or personal property, plus any medical bills and loss or damage to your personal belongings. How much should I be covered? The minimum coverage is $25,000, and many policy-holders in Canada can save up to 30 per cent on their monthly insurance cost, according to insuranceQuotes.ca. If you're hit, you can ask your driver-side coverage to cover more of the cost, and more of you should. But you may have to wait because insurance companies work on a 'gross loss ratio' that they use in determining how much they cover the average loss of a claim – which is usually $25,000. Many insurers don't do that – like all Canadian insurance companies – they only take into account a driver's actual vehicle and driver when calculating their insurance premiums – not a passenger carrying your gear, for example. So you might get more coverage if you have someone that is riding with you because you could be considered as the vehicle carrying the items. The policy might not go up, however, if you have a driver that isn't wearing a seat belt, or if your driver isn't properly equipped – in which case your driver-side coverage will be less. How much you might save can vary according to your vehicle's condition when it was struck. It depends on how much damage the car sustained, the driver's condition when the incident occurred and any other factors, which could include your insurer's claim procedure. What's in it for car insurers? The average per-centage premium difference between what a consumer pays for their car insurance and what they are expected to pay will vary according to age, gender and personal circumstances. For instance, a female driver who has a five-year-old Honda Civic but no insurance and earns $21,000 per year will pay more to get a similar-size, newer Honda Accord. The difference would depend on what type of insurance you have and what policy is on your plate, and how long it's been since you paid your last premium. On the other hand, a male driver with a $50-million-plus home would pay less than the insurer would be comfortable with paying, especially if they have no insurance. As a driver with no insurance, you may have to pay less because they pay to cover your accident, which means they don't have to pay your medical bills. Here's a breakdown of what to expect when you drive – and what to get. Insurance company policies: what it means to drive Generally, if you have a comprehensive and collision policy, you shouldn't have to worry about going through anything more complicated than the minimum required by law if you get into an accident while driving legally. However, if you don't have any insurance, then it's an extra step you'll have to go through in order to get some help from your automobile insurance company's policies to recover the costs of your accident. The cost of damage to your vehicle and your personal belongings can vary in many other ways. For instance, a large dent in your vehicle may cost much less to repair than if you're driving an older model that you didn't think through properly the way you parked. That's why it's always a good idea to get a quote from several insurance companies to make sure the cost you're paying meets your needs. Here's a more detailed look at what the cost of collisions could mean for those who own cars they drive every day: Car collision When a driver takes a vehicle off the road they increase the risk that it will roll onto its side, or roll out onto a roadway in a manner that could hurt many other drivers. When this occurs, the potential for a serious injury is often much greater – especially in a situation where vehicles can be seen approaching from more than one direction. Collisions with cars and trucks are typically the most serious type of collisions and are the single leading cause of fatalities and injuries for children and women between the ages of 3 and 35 years of age. In order to decrease the risk from collision, you must reduce the risk of one or more of these situations resulting in a	0
It seems that this issue of the NUT has the support of the whole organisation. The NUT has set up a website http://www.numbersunion.org.uk/help-us-put-a-stop-to-this-abuse/. I am asking that the NUT puts this issue to the Members ballot this autumn. A public vote would be a stronger way of making the decision. If there were no votes in October, then the union could simply ignore the whole issue.  I have not seen what the reasons are for not voting or having the issue put forward to Members (how else was I supposed to know about it?).  I don't believe there is a need to take the matter to the courts. The NUT is the elected governing body for the NUM. What the NUT needs to do instead is to look into ways of putting a halt to the abusive and racist incidents and of dealing with those responsible for them - the NUT has a duty to investigate and put an end to it.  If a vote is not put forward this autumn then I would like to send a message to those who have spoken out. The union does still have your support but I think that the NUT has some work to do to try and address how we are failing the majority of its own members.  I would like to ask that all parties should put their best efforts into attempting to stop this abuse from happening again.	0
The best thing to know about the American Dream — even in a Donald Trump administration — will be that it is neither a myth nor far-fetched. The American Dream as the premise of economics — a society in which all aspire to become better off despite material differences — is almost never an abstraction. In many cases, it's a reality. But even with all the talk about equality, the American Dream — or even its opposite — remains a hard sell in most of the developed world because it comes with strings attached. People who are born into the upper, middle and upper classes are, on average, more fortunate than those who are born out of those social classes. Their birthright of the American Dream means they may not necessarily succeed if they succeed. Those fortunate kids who do succeed generally are rewarded with higher levels of income for the rest of their working lives. That dynamic is unlikely to change in the coming years even under the most egalitarian government in recent history. Consider that the U.K.'s Conservative Party government just enacted a regressive tax plan to fund a massive new public-sector pension plan that, among other things, would boost top-earning retirees to nearly £300,000 from £240,000 ($400,000). Similarly, the Netherlands' new Social Democratic government is implementing a similar, if considerably smaller, plan. Even the most progressive nations in the world — those that, according to the U.N., have among the best human rights records — tend to tax people at higher rates to cover their public-sector pensions. "When you raise taxes people just save less." In order to create a pension program for those in the higher middle class, the Netherlands and U.K. must fund it with higher taxes than most of their citizens pay today — as high, in the US, as about 37 percent (about double the national rate). In order to fund the new program, they plan to raise taxes on a larger cohort of taxpayers, while at the same time slashing personal income taxes from 13 percent in the Netherlands to 10 percent in the U.K. This is the problem with the American Dream. The U.S. is home to the most unequal society in the history of the world, but it's also home to the most unequal society in the developed world. If a person's economic opportunity is determined in part by where they were born — even if that circumstance may have changed over the course of their lifetime — where they were born can shape their future even more than where they are now. The U.S. has always boasted some of the most generous programs to assist people in getting to where they want to be. As recently as the late 1960s in the U.S., the government paid millions of poor students directly in the form of Pell Grants, which covered tuition for a four-year college program. Today, however, student loans that have a ballooning interest rate make it prohibitively expensive to attend college for the poor. Indeed, in order to attend a public college in the U.S. at all, a poor person must save $26,000 for four years, or $54,000 over 25 years. The average American family's net wealth is $73,000, while it's just $23,000 for a family headed by someone making below the poverty line. Yet one of the U.S. government's biggest funding priorities — the American Opportunity Tax Credit (which offers people up to $2,500 in government money per year once the student graduates with an associate's degree, and up to $4,000 once they graduate with a bachelor's degree) — goes mostly to the middle and upper classes. If a person's economic opportunity is determined in part by where they were born in the U.S., where they live now can shape their future even more than where they are now. "The idea that you would be born to a wealthy family — that you will be a billionaire in your 50s — is certainly a myth," Yale professor William Julius Wilson told me. In fact, a great many people who are born into middle-class families wind up becoming "the poorest half" of the poor, according to the National Foundation for Educational Research. And while there is a good chance that someone born into poverty might succeed as an entrepreneur — a good percentage of the U.S. population is still struggling with poverty — even if they don't, someone born into the upper middle class is virtually certain to become a multimillionaire. "If you're born into an upper middle class family you almost always will be a multimillionaire," Wilson said. "If you're born into a lower middle class family you likely will not." This inequality is not an abstract idea that exists in a theoretical realm, or simply an issue of poor people on drugs or rich people on drugs. It is not a matter of wealth created in a bubble. A study published this month by the Pew Charitable Trusts found that the wealthiest	0
If you want a good laugh, just look at Facebook's privacy settings. A new video shows the social media giant doing what it does best — turning on the privacy setting that says you are allowed to read what folks who don't know you are reading. Then look. It's been a busy couple of weeks for Facebook, which is being sued by the U.S. Attorney's office in Los Angeles over a program that reportedly tracked people's Internet use without their knowledge. The two companies are in some ways similar. Facebook has an enormous user base, but does so with its social network being as accessible as it is. "I can see if you have the 'Notify me with updates' on, that is quite telling," says the video. "They know when you have your phone on, they know when you were going to coffee today." It then plays a clip where Facebook lets you change your privacy settings. The settings say, "Your privacy is important to us and what you do online can impact your friends and relationships, your job and your family. You have the power to control your information and Facebook is here to help." The YouTube video ends with an ad for Privacy Switch, which is a new service that lets you do the same thing and control what people who don't know you can see. Forbes reported earlier this week on the lawsuit by the U.S. Attorney General that accused Facebook of violating the Federal Records Act. They claim that during the 2012 U.S. presidential campaign, a pro-Presidential candidate named John Huntsman Jr. used Facebook to share information about his fundraising efforts while he was being vetted. Facebook says that "in a very small selection of the cases identified on the Justice Department's website — less than 1% of the more than 800,000 federal criminal prosecutions prosecuted during the last decade — charges were filed based on information revealed to the public through our information practices."	0
By Andrew Burnes We've all heard of graphics cards with their impressive capabilities, but few have ever experienced one that blows away the competition, even from those very same platforms. The new AMD Radeon RX Vega, which can be purchased for the very affordable premium of $499 or a mere $399, is one of those products, and it can blow past almost anybody's expectations thanks to some seriously impressive performance from the 4GB of HBM memory running at an incredible 4.20 TFLOPS of processing power (double the previous generation's Radeon RX Vega Frontier Edition at 3.8 TFLOPS). The RX Vega 64 and 36GB of 3GB of GDDR5 memory on board are capable of 12-16.29 Gbps of peak bandwidth, as explained in our earlier feature. Those massive HBM stacks are so dense that AMD claims the Vega 64 can deliver more performance than a single GeForce GPU. Noteworthy is that a card running a single Radeon Vega 64 is more than capable of gaming at 1440p and 4K resolutions at medium and high settings, with smooth frame rates, low input latency, and zero perceptible stuttering. The RX Vega 64 is the company's first graphics card on a dual-GPU solution, but it doesn't make use of two, but two of AMD's next-gen Vega GPUs. This model packs 16GB of HBM memory running at 8Gbps and a pair of stacked High Bandwidth Memory chips, clocked at 6GHz, working to feed 32GB of more HBM memory up to 64GB. A single HBM2 stack is able to deliver an impressive 4.20 TFLOPS, and we've seen the same clock speeds on a single Vega 64, but it still pales in comparison to the full 64GB capacity needed by the RX Vega graphics card. So, does such enormous memory capacity mean more data is needed for processing? It does, and with the RX Vega 64 AMD claims its memory can be used as cache for graphics workloads, and that doesn't change when it comes to how we use games and VR experience. The AMD Vega 64 graphics card will be the first graphics card to offer dedicated GDDR5 memory capable of playing VR as VR Ready, which means it can reliably produce stable frame rates without a hitch. That's something that AMD claims will be important when it comes to the Rift launch. In case you're not familiar, a VR Ready graphics card is able to sustain a 60 frames per second refresh and is able to deliver smooth performance no matter what the resolution. We do have one feature on the RX Vega 64 that we haven't seen yet but will be sure to bring you more of in our full Vega Gaming launch coverage on PC Gamer next week. The Vega 64 Graphics Card Comes In Two Versions To make things even more appealing, the AMD Vega Graphics cards come in two different versions. We got our hands on the new Vega 56 (which is AMD branding for their new flagship cards) at AMD's booth to share with you, so you can see for yourself what's new and improved for such an incredible price point. This card delivers a premium price point that'll put you very close to the VR Ready and VR Ready 2.0 cards at that price point, and it features a custom waterblock with RGB LEDs which can be controlled via the RGB LED Strip and Fan controller. To top things off, you get dual BIOSes, a Dual-X Cooler design, and plenty of other features. There is one problem, however. For a card that's so well-priced, AMD has dropped the resolution from the Vega 56 to the Vega 64. It's not that we're complaining; that card isn't exactly impressive, as we showed you in our Vega Frontier Edition review, which is powered by a new Vega 64 graphics card. There are two reasons for this: As the RX Vega 64 sports a dual-GPU design, you need two graphics cards instead of just one. If you use one of AMD's high-refresh and high-resolution monitors, the Vega 64 is unable to provide the smooth frame rates that you need from VR-ready, VR Ready 2.0 graphics cards. The resolution that it can support is 1920x1080, or at least 1920x1080 at 120Hz. With the AMD FreeSync feature enabled, the monitor can only push 20-bit color, so the Vega 64 needs to upscale games down to a higher resolution in order to support the high refresh rates required by the RX Vega 56. When the RX Vega 64 comes to market in late December 2017, both variants will sell for under $500, so it will be interesting to see which features AMD and its partners make use of in this new model. At this price point, it seems as though the performance of the RX Vega 64 is just too enticing. We'll be bringing you all of our impressions on when the launch lands on Monday, November 28th, so stay tuned! In the meantime, if you	0
KABUL (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump's order to ban immigrants and refugees for 90 days and all visitors for 120 days has caused widespread concern in Afghanistan but at least one local government expects more donations in response to the ban. U.S. President Donald Trump walks with Secretary of State Rex Tillerson (R) and Secretary of Homeland Security John Kelly (L) as they meet with Afghanistan's President Ashraf Ghani in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, U.S., January 27, 2017. REUTERS/Jim Bourg Afghan Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi said the U.S. executive order did not impact the country politically because most Afghan people did not like it and were in favor of a better economic relationship with the United States that would help Afghan forces. "The Americans know it, but the Afghans ... are very thankful for every gesture of goodwill from America," Abbasi told Reuters at an informal news conference with his foreign minister. "I hope it will be reflected on our donation of aid, I hope America will continue to offer the support and the cooperation towards Afghanistan," he said. The ban was due to start on Thursday but was put on hold when Trump's administration was told last week that a federal court in Washington state had put the ban on hold. Several U.S Senators, including Republican Bob Corker, a Tennessee senator, and Democrat Chris Coons, a Delaware senator, said the administration should quickly re-instate the travel ban and get the courts to overturn an earlier decision that allowed Trump to put the ban on hold. The White House did not respond immediately to a request for comment on whether it would revise the ban, given that the appeal of the March court order was upheld. Trump signed the order on Friday after making the case in a speech at a military academy in Florida. He said the move was needed to improve vetting and national security after a failed attempt earlier this year by Washington to send in tens of thousands of extra troops to fight insurgents, including members of the Haqqani network. The ban applies indefinitely to most immigrants from Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. It also suspends the refugee program for 120 days. Abbasi said the ban should not affect the Afghan people who were not citizens or had permanent resident rights in the United States, or the people who had entered the United States as refugees. He said the government had not received any complaints from American citizens. He said he was happy that a court had said a 90-day ban on immigrants could not go into effect unless it can be justified with good reasons. "Even if I disagree, it is better than the alternative, which is the ban on entering Afghanistan at all, for a long period of time," he said In another sign of the international criticism and concern this ban has caused, the German foreign ministry summoned an Afghan ambassador to express objections to the order. U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson had expressed concern about the ban last week. [nL2N1O24Q5] Washington accused the government of Kabul of harboring militants and the Afghan government had made clear it had no intention of doing so. On Thursday, Afghan security forces conducted a raid to free a militant leader. "It is extremely regrettable that the Afghan government continues to harbor terrorist elements. And so all efforts are on our side to counter that," U.S. State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said. U.S. Marine General Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said the ban would not affect efforts to combat ISIS, the militant group also known as ISIS or ISIL, which has been fighting Western forces in Afghanistan for years and is a bitter enemy of the Taliban. Some countries will take less of a hit from the ban than others, he said, adding that the United States would continue to focus its efforts on ISIS's "core" regions in Syria and Iraq.	0
The most notable feature of the 2017 Toyota 86 is that it's a three-door sedan. This means it's an SUV, but it's actually an affordable compact car for most people as well. That's not to say that this model doesn't have some unique features (which are impressive), but just because it's a three-door doesn't mean you can't make it into a wagon by swapping the doors and the rear seats. How To Make An 86 Mini Wagon  The key to making an 86 mini wagon is going the off-roader route first and then making an SUV out of it; however, it doesn't have to have a hardtop roof. In your attempt to make a minivan, you'll need to do exactly what you would do for a wagon: get rid of any non-essential parts from the wagon model, such as an SUV engine, seats, or mirrors. Some parts were left in order to keep the price down, but some more expensive parts were tossed in as well, such as the gas tank, air conditioner, and brake rotors. Toyota says that the engine was left for two reasons. First, it's one more item you can remove if you want to convert your mini wagon into a wagon. Second, the engine isn't necessary (because it's a small engine, and mini wagons are actually just compact crossover vehicles) and it would be a pain to swap out the engine because no other vehicle can use it. The most common changes made to the mini wagons are the front bumper, side skirt covers, door panels, and floor mats; all of these can be taken off with a little effort. You'll need to find a place with a strong back rubber/rubberized surface, as these will break off quickly when getting them off. Other parts you're better off keeping are the front wheel drive, rear hub, and rear bumper. After getting the parts off, you're going to need to trim off the back tire so you can fit the spare tire under it; otherwise, your new mini wagon will have a flat tire while driving around town. You could also skip some of this stuff and replace these parts yourself, but why would you do that? To find the spare tire you'll need to get a wheel locker on your way to work. Then pick it up in a parking lot in which to work. This is important so the tire has plenty of room for you to put it. Before starting a mini wagon build, I highly recommend finding a mini wagon which already has some modifications done. This will save you a lot of money and headaches. You need to find a mini wagon that has been sitting around for a while. Look at its interior, its interior condition, its tires and paint, and maybe even its engine. You're looking for something that's already been well maintained. If the minivan has all of the above, it means it has one or more of the following things wrong: Tires that don't match the wheel Tires that are too worn Tires that aren't the right diameter or size Paint that's flaking off If you find any of these things, it will be a good indication that the mini wagon has some other issue. You'll notice some of these issues in other mini wagons as well, and they'll go away once you get rid of the parts for the mini wagon to make a regular wagon: Tires that are too worn Tires that are too small Tires that are off Tires that don't match the wheel Tires that are too new Tires that aren't the right diameter or size Paint that is flaking off You'll notice that some of these items can make the mini wagons better looking, but it'll increase the cost of the mini wagon. You'll get more value out of the mini wagons with the correct accessories on it. Keep tabs on these things in your mini wagon so you can sell it if they turn out to be a bad investment. How To Convert A Mini Wagon Into A Mini Sedan You'll need to take the off-roader and run it through some modifications, but the most important step of taking a mini wagon and turning it into a minivan is to give it the big door. This can be achieved by changing the roof, or by cutting part of the body panel. The easiest way to change the roof on a mini wagon is to take it off and then replace the door with a small, flat panel panel or a small plastic panel. Just be very careful to not cut into the side of the door or into the plastic panel to put in the new door, as you don't want to shatter it. A more expensive and time consuming way to change the roof is to break it into a new	0
RICHMOND is a rare commodity in today's world, with a passionate fan base and a passionate player base too. In my five years of attending, I can count the number of times I have encountered an angry Richmond supporter on one hand. And I'm a diehard football supporter too — a lifelong Tigers supporter and a lifelong A-League fan. So when I came back from Sunday's 1-0 win over Adelaide, a game at which Richmond fans booed their own players on multiple fronts, the first thing I realised was how lucky I was to have witnessed an event such as this in person. How did Richmond's players react? media_camera Fans turned their anger on Richmond's home supporters ... The most common response by players to jeers was to give a quick wave of the hand. The next two reactions were to laugh, which often made the loudest noise. When I spoke to Richmond's David Astbury about the booing, he said he did not get why it happened. He said he had asked himself why this happened. "I looked at the crowd on the way off and their faces ... they looked at me," Astbury said. "So I asked a couple of them. They said they were just upset their team got booed. "They were just disappointed, but, honestly, why on earth would they boo at me?" What's a Richmond fan to do? It's no surprise that Richmond is home to an intense, passionate fan base. They've not won a single premiership since 2007 and have won only two finals appearances in that time. So they expect a certain level of player performance and on Sunday that disappointment was clear. Some fans were loud, but this is a football ground and a football crowd. So a couple of Richmond players got up and waved their fists in the air or shook their heads while the players on the field were trying to put things back in perspective. Many supporters were very angry and took to social media to vent their frustration. Fans on Twitter were quick to share their frustrations at the booing — with some suggesting Richmond need to get their game organised. The club had a meeting with a small group of fans after the game. It's one thing being outraged at someone's behaviour on the field or being upset that someone is booing, but you can't take it out on people outside the stadium. That's just wrong. Why were players not able to control their anger? What should players do differently this week?	0
"The biggest change you can make for people in this town is to tell them what they want — the only thing that can kill the spirit of our town is lies," said Councilman James White. "And the fact is in this city we live in these lies all the time." White is trying to pass a new resolution, which will require residents not only to report crime and suspicious activity, but also to provide video and photography if the police don't return their calls. And this is the kind of thing that was considered so taboo under the Reagan administration that Mayor Thomas T. Phelan called them "political correctness run amok." But, in the 1990s, when some white liberals were outraged that African-Americans might be having trouble finding a house, it became acceptable, especially on the East Side, to ask every African-American homeowner to take out a map of his neighborhood and show it to a white person. And some of these maps included tiny details such as the race of the house next door to yours. The practice was called "redlining." It was a way to discriminate against people. I did a story on it for The Baltimore Sun in 1998. (I still have it at the Sun's archives, and am glad I was there at the time). To show the racial maps wasn't all about race, the mayor of Baltimore and the head of the city Housing Authority even used the images in their promotional literature: "In this historic neighborhood, you can look at the map to discover what kind of neighborhood awaits you," the housing Authority said in a statement. Now many years later, what we have learned about what "dynamic" means in urban planning is that if it benefits the white majority to not rent to African Americans, or if it benefits the minority to have to live next to white people, that's called "dynamic." The only race that can't afford to live in a neighborhood is one that isn't white. But with our diversity, who says who counts as African-Americans? I am black. I want to live in a black neighborhood — where I feel safe and can enjoy playing baseball at Camden Yards, the Orioles, the University of Maryland and the Inner Harbor. I'd like to buy a house in the Eastern Shore, where it has cool bars, live-work lofts and cool restaurants. I'm interested in the area. But I can't because it's in the middle of an African-American town. A black neighborhood, if we want a neighborhood, does not have to be just white. There are African-Americans across the country fighting to be recognized for their place in this country, and one of the best ways to do that is to live in a black neighborhood — not a white neighborhood. No, I am more than a neighbor to white people. I'm one of them. My skin is lighter and my hair is frizzier. Some people don't like the look because they want to believe that "there are no black people in Baltimore." So, to people who want to tell me I have no place in the city, what in the hell are you talking about? To you who say I should accept less than I feel like I am entitled to — where do you live? Where do you worship? If you think the mayor can't be trusted to build a black neighborhood without white help, we can only imagine what he's thinking. But the mayor doesn't want the support of you — and, as I see it, neither do you. Donte' Stallworth was a Baltimore Sun reporter for more than a dozen years.

The first episode of our new series 'The Good Life' starts here today (November 11) on Netflix. This series is about good things. The Good Life is about giving, living in joy, in community, by sharing. It's about helping people, being inspired and doing great things. It's also a series of 'Good' stories and our first series focused solely on the personal stories of seven individuals, sharing their life stories together. We are working with Netflix on a second season which will follow the story of those characters and include six more to follow. That second season is expected to premiere in 2018. The first episode follows David, a writer whose brother and sister commit suicide. David must confront his guilt at his failures, but learns from his brother that the things most needed in life have nothing to do with material goods. Away from home, David travels to Greece and learns how to share his talents and make a living teaching guitar to children. On the other coast, a teenager named Jules travels to Peru with a backpack full of money, only to find poverty and conflict. His hopes of finding something worthwhile are shattered by some bad decisions.  of course, we don't live in a perfect world and there can be good things in life, but we must keep the focus on helping people. Even if it's doing something good to help a local tribe by helping with a disaster relief camp! We're excited. Hope you will check it out as we share our personal stories today!	0
It would take some serious hubris to think you can sell an album this expensive for $2M. But you don't need to be an idiot to figure it out. It's only $2M! According to TMZ, an auction on eBay on Wednesday (March 10) will pay off the remaining unsold records from Paul McCartney 's 1970s catalog. The final auction count is as follows: - The Beatles Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band - $749,500 - The Beatles Revolver - $854,750 - The Beatles Abbey Road - $1,200,000 - The Beatles The White Album - $1,420,000 - The Beatles Anthology Two - $2,400,000 - The Beatles The Beatles: Eight Club - $7,000,000 - The Beatles Anthology Three - $20,000,000 - The Beatles Revolver Plus Anthology Two - $40,000,000 - Anthology Three - $250,000,000 The White Album was originally going to go to the Smithsonian (although I think they were not prepared for the public outrage). This is the second time a Beatles album has sold above the original price, and it is also a record. The highest price for a single Beatles album? The Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band which sold at auction for $749,000 in 2005. (I guess when you have a record, you can usually sell it for more.) It would take a few more thousand on top of the $1,200,000 in new record to break this record. For further information, check out the page in the source links. You can click on the "listings" tab (if one is on) to see more specific pricing. UPDATE: The White Album has been put up for sale. The auction will take place on March 17, 2013. Thanks for the update, Nick.	0
After two seasons of fighting a war to keep a rival tribe out of the game, Kelly and Joe continue to fight — and that fight is taking place in the bathroom. "I still don't want to quit on this season. But, you know, I've been there my whole life. I've been going into Tribal Council naked in the shower. That doesn't mean I'm not going to compete," Kelly told Yahoo. "At a certain point, you know, you have to realize, if I don't play well, I might have gotten home the first time. So, I don't want to play a character. I know what my role's going to be, but I'm just hoping I'm going to make it to the end with a strong game. And obviously, I'm still going to go into Tribal and maybe I'll play it cool or I'll take a game from someone. That's just, like, a possibility." Kelly thinks her biggest obstacle is not physically. "If I'm the one who goes home, it's going to be because I don't have any alliances at this point. So, you know, those girls may have the numbers. So, my challenge will be to have more than one alliance going to the end because I don't have anybody there for me," she said. "And even if I could build one, I just don't know if I want that. I want it to be as pure as can be, which is why I'm telling you I'm not quitting. It's my plan to play until I win. And I might not win, but I mean, I just want to win, man." Joe is feeling like his odds will improve in this game, too. "I think Kelly's going to have a tough time staying around. She was voted out just before Tribal, so I think it's time for her to go. Joe feels like he's going to be able to get to the end to win so he doesn't feel like he needs to be as loyal as Kelly is," a source previously told Yahoo. But Kelly still has her eye on her own game. "At a certain point, you know, you have to realize, if I don't play well, I might have gotten home the first time. So, I don't want to play a character. I know what my role's going to be, but I'm just hoping I'm going to make it to the end with a strong game. And obviously, I'm still going to go into Tribal and maybe I'll play it cool or I'll take a game from someone. That's just, like, a possibility," she said, admitting that she is not willing to give everyone the benefit of the doubt. "Everybody has this image of the strong-minded, stoic, alpha-person when it comes to Survivor. I don't think that's who I am," she said. For more on the Survivor finale, including an exclusive video interview with Jeff Probst, tune in to the finale live to PEOPLE NOW. Additional reporting by RYAN STRAVATO	0
A new law that requires transgender people to use the bathrooms consistent with the sex on their birth certificate is headed to President Donald Trump — and if he signs the measure, the federal government will no longer be able to discriminate against them. "The bathroom problem is really a political issue," Matt Wood, a legislative counsel at the Human Rights Campaign, a gay rights advocacy group, told NBC News. "This is a federal issue and the federal government has a huge stake in it." Wood said the law represents "another step toward the full inclusion of transgender and gender non-conforming people" because it gives them the same federal rights as every other American. Trump, who has been a tough critic of President Barack Obama's transgender bathroom policy, has yet to comment on the law. But activists already view the law as a sign that the tide of transgender acceptance may be coming to a close. "My hope is that this is just the beginning of the end," Sarah Warbelow, the legal director at the Human Rights Campaign, told NBC News. "This is a major achievement that we're seeing happen. We have not had this many victories at the federal level." For years, civil rights groups have argued that transgender women should have the choice to use the bathroom in line with their self-identified gender. But the Obama administration and some states have fought against these rights saying it would infringe on privacy. A federal judge in Texas decided that the Obama administration could not enforce a mandate in July, a decision that blocked the Department of Justice from enforcing Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, which prohibits sex discrimination in public accommodations. But a federal appeals court on Thursday reversed the judge's decision and said the Obama administration could enforce the directive. "They can tell you that there will be privacy concerns — there will be all sorts of privacy concerns," Michael Silverman, the executive director of the Transgender Law Center (TLC), told NBC News. "But the bottom line is, you do not have the right to make somebody else uncomfortable. … This is all going to create an environment in which transgender people are less likely to know they have all this in their back pocket." Now, the issue could finally be headed to the desk of the president who promised to restore the honor of "dying with honor." In May 2016, after the Supreme Court gutted a key part of the historic Defense of Marriage Act, a president could have ordered federal agencies to abide by the ruling in order to allow legally married same-sex couples the privacy for which they have long fought. Trump's first six months in office have been marked by a steady rollback of federal protections that protect LGBT people. And the transgender bathroom issue is one more example of that. Under Obama, the U.S. government had issued guidelines stating that schools should allow transgender students to use facilities conforming with their gender identity. But in July 2017, Trump issued a memorandum that said the Obama Administration had been "wrong" and instructed the Department of Homeland Security to stop defending the Obama guidance against the federal courts. That triggered a lawsuit by states. The Obama administration defended its new guidelines in court, saying any federal employee could simply tell a school that they support transgender rights in bathrooms and locker rooms. But the Obama Administration was forced to walk that back, arguing that the administration was only protecting children in the name of diversity. And in December, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 8th Circuit ruled that the government should have to follow the guidance. "For the first time, the administration can't claim neutrality in enforcing the law," Wood said. "It's not just a case of 'trust me' any more. The administration is now obligated to do its job and enforce federal law." Still, advocates warn that the fight to protect transgender rights hasn't truly ended for the transgender community. The battle will go on. The Department of Justice has said it will enforce the new guidance. On Thursday, the agency released guidelines that advise schools how to treat transgender students, as well as how they should handle transgender personnel who might come forward to share information about their transition. Even as the president moves forward, advocates will continue to work to ensure the full equality they have fought for — as well as their own safety. "We need to stop being afraid to use the restroom," Wood said. "We need to stop being afraid that our own parents won't know we're here." This article has been updated to include comments by Michael Silverman with the Transgender Law Center.	0
In what will undoubtedly come as a disappointment to fans who are hoping for a real continuation of the Dark Knight's story, Warner Bros. has announced the first-ever Batman "Rage on the Streets of Gotham" game will be coming to the Xbox 360 and PC sometime in the very near future. At the moment, we don't know a definite release date—but what we do know is that the game is coming exclusively to XBLA and Steam. Here's a very rough screenshot of the game that Warner Bros. sent over earlier today for approval: No release date has been set yet for the game, but the company sent over a pretty extensive overview of the game in an email to Xbox World: A single player narrative driven game, Batman vs. the Arkham Knight is about the ultimate battle between good and evil as you play as Batman who must face his greatest threats as he fights Gotham's most dangerous criminals. Utilizing new technologies and techniques that leverage a rich universe of Warner Bros. properties, including Batman, The Dark Knight, Justice League, The Joker and other DC Comics characters, Batman's greatest foes will unite to unleash an all-out assault on Gotham City that will span the entire year in March to serve as a prologue to the climactic event, Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. The game takes inspiration from The LEGO Movie and features a huge roster of DC Comics characters and more than 150 characters and villains are playable. The game is built from the ground up to be the ultimate Batman game and includes a whole new game engine for next gen consoles and PC and features a new physics system that provides amazing physicality when interacting with Batman's gadgets and weapons. There is a variety of mission types including story and side quests, action-packed chase segments and the ability for players to play with co-op gameplay. It isn't much to go on, but from what we know so far, the upcoming XBLA version of Batman vs. Arkham Knight will be a lot more than a mere port. Hopefully, players should have more information in a few weeks when Warner Bros. confirms when they'll be ready for a potential March 10th release.	0
It's still technically summer, but we can all tell this is not your average day. There's plenty of time to fill with activities, be they at the park, home or in the park. Here are 10 fun events you can take part in in a town full of fun. Some are outdoors so bring your own shoes and sunscreen or get the sunscreen, or wear your sunglasses and enjoy the sun while at the park and take the kids to the park for something different. There is no doubt that these are some of the fun things to do in your community, some are going to be outdoors so you should bring your own shoes and sunscreen or get the sunscreen and wear sunscreen while at the park. This list is from the best to some of the newest ones you might want to check out as the summer season progresses. Take a Walk or Ride The best time to do something like this is in the park, a park you can enjoy with the whole family. We've highlighted some great places that you can get together in town where you can take a nice run or a bike ride or walk up and down the street with your family. You could even take that same run for an hour or two. Some of our favorites for this are the Park on Main Trailhead in South Park or Mill Creek Trailhead in Oak Hollow Woods on Main. It's easy to do both and you can do it every single day if you want to. Make a Splash While at the Pool You can splash around at a variety of pools around town and they all are open from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. There are some pools with lifeguards and some that are completely open to the public. Many places will have ice water in the water but you won't find that at a pool with lifeguards. Some pools also have a spray feature where you can use your beverage or towel to get rid of all the water on your body. Visit a Car Show Not only is car show season in the summer, there are tons of car shows right now, most of them in towns that are within a short drive from the Twin Cities. So if you are going out of your way to go to a car show in your area, make sure to plan ahead and visit when car show season is happening. You'll find the car show locations throughout the summer. If you've been looking for a car show to attend, you might want to check out the Minnesota Auto Show. It is a two-day event with lots of different types of cars on display along with food and entertainment. Spend an Evening at the Ball Game We do this all the time, we go to the game. Why not spend some more time with your friends and your families and spend some money with your friends and enjoy a good ball game or a baseball game? At this point in Minnesota baseball season people are doing it for their children and young adults as a family activity. So that's a big reason why people are out there spending money so much on a ball game. We recommend getting a group together for a group outing to watch the game. Some great places like the Twins' season tickets or the Twins VIP Night are great starting points for getting together as a group. Take a Boat Ride Minnesota has amazing beaches and lakes so why not spend the afternoon relaxing in a boat as you go fishing in the summer. The state does a lot of things right when it comes to having great beaches and lakes. Check out the lake beaches throughout the summer for some great fishing on the lake and some nice scenery along the way. And if you want to have a sailboat ride or just relax on an outdoor trip at the lake then check out The Beach at Lake Wobegon in Bayfield or the Bayside Boat Rentals in Moorhead. Go to the Ice Cream Stand This is one thing you probably love the most because it's fun to go and find something new to try. We've already told you you should take the kids off to the park and let 'em explore their own and try something new, what better time to stop at the ice cream stand and stock up? The Ice Cream Stand has an open door policy so they are always looking for new customers to bring in their ice cream. They have different kinds of treats that can really change the way you look at ice cream. We recommend the Popsicles with Fruit, Banana, Chocolate and Lemon. You can also get a Caramel Macchiato or other kind of ice cream or just go with the classic Strawberry Shortcake. There's tons more to try at places like the Ice Cream Stand. Play in the Pool or the Beach The summer is an incredible time for kids to come out and enjoy the water in the city and the beach or even on a boat. So what are you waiting for? Let's take these things to the next level. You can always visit the beaches that have lifeguards in the summer as the parks	0
I've been playing with the new version of the Google Chrome apps lately, and I've noticed a few things that might take some people out of the equation altogether. Now, I'm probably just as guilty as the next user of Chrome for failing to use Chrome's new design elements very well (if I'm being honest, I usually just try to get rid of it as quickly as possible), but if you look at this screenshot from my recent update, you'll notice that there's an all new button that appears on a tab's browser bar when it's using Chrome's new tab menu. This button will pop up a mini-menus for the currently selected tab, as well as a large tab menu with a few small thumbnails for the currently available apps (not all apps will show up: for example, it looks like some sites won't show up even in the main menu). While this is a nice looking feature, I feel that you would only want to have one tab bar tab selected at a time, as opposed to the two in the previous version of Google Chrome. This isn't the only new feature you'll notice with the updates. The Chrome team has also fixed a number of bugs with the browser itself. For example, you may find that the mouse pointer no longer shakes when you hover over a search result on the URL bar. You may also be happy to learn that Chrome will now remember the last five websites you've visited, so that you can quickly return to them in the future. These five websites, including the page or sections you visited last, will appear on the bottom of the left-hand window, and clicking them or double-clicking the page they're on will open up a new tab with the same URL in a new location. Google's also included a bunch of other small-ish new features. You might get the sense that a few of these appear to be new ideas that were sitting around somewhere until recently, like the ability to see your recently opened sites (even in the new tab menu), or the extension option, which allows extensions to install directly in Chrome without having to install third-party add-ons. You'll also notice that the site or app you're currently viewing now appears on the browser tab itself, rather than a tab in the new tab menu. Instead of being listed first in the menu, the site will appear below the current tab in the list. This is because the page is already open when you open the menu, so it's better for both the site developer and the user to take advantage of the menu instead of the original tab bar being split to reflect the fact that a webpage is already open. As for the new tab menu: while some users might be uncomfortable with seeing their most recent search hits onscreen so soon after getting a tab, I think it's a useful feature that will help Chrome's users more easily find specific sites that you want to go to. So, in conclusion, I'm pretty excited about these updates to the Chrome browser, and I hope to see other users find them useful too. The only downside I can find is that those without the latest version will find these updates pretty slow, as it takes a while for the pages to load. If that is the case for you, you might want to wait until more people test these out and then share your experiences. You can check out the latest version of Google's Chrome at chrome.google.com (or update to the latest version manually if you're on Windows), but these updates should appear over the next few days.	0
"This is no longer the 1960s." That's the opening line of a recent column in the New York Times, in which writer Eric Lipton describes how we are no longer talking about a cultural conflict between the left and the right. Now we are in "a war," which he sees as one that's increasingly turning on the economy. Liberals are "taking back" the economy—the way they "reversed Republican control of government at three government agencies"—as a means to protect workers' rights, make work pay and protect the environment. We might call this the "New Democrats" theory of politics. It is based on the idea that left-wing politicians' policies can help the economy take off, which in turn will help the government's ability to do the things that we all want it to do—such as take over control of large sectors of the economy and enact new safety net programs. If Democrats control the White House and Congress then, as they hope to do, they can enact policy changes that will make working people much more prosperous—and thereby help the government get elected again. The New Democrats' theory has been tested on the ground. During the eight years of the so-called recovery, the economy has grown at a blistering pace—much faster than in the preceding recovery, which began eight years before President Obama took office—but the economy has been more sluggish in 2013 than it was during the last recovery. The New Democrats take this to mean that the recovery is not sustainable. According to them, the economy has to go in another direction before things start improving. The country, then, needs a president who represents "populism," who will put the public interest ahead of the interests of the rich and powerful. There are three kinds of populists—the liberal-class liberal, the moderate-class liberal or centrist Republican, and the radical-class capitalist or right-wing capitalist Democrat. The idea is that if left-wing Democrats do the right things for the economy, then they will have a better chance to get elected than if right-wing Democrats do the right things for the economy. Since the Great Recession ended in 2009, the New Democrats have had tremendous success with this theory. They have "reversed" their party's long-time support for free trade deals, especially those with Asian countries like China and South Korea. They have supported expanding Social Security and Medicaid (including in their budgets recently, for example, by putting them on the back burner while slashing spending on food stamps). They have put into place a number of regulations aimed at curbing the financial sector, including the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and the 2010 Dodd–Frank financial reform law. And now, as the economy grows again, New Democrats are arguing that the economy should be allowed to grow to the point where it reaches full employment, which in turn will create more jobs. It is not that the New Democrats have never been proponents of policies that could have a positive effect on the economy. In the early 2000s, during the Clinton era, that was one of the arguments that the New Democrats used to argue for a strong national health-care system and a high minimum wage. After all, a strong economy is a big reason why people have a right to health care and to the minimum wage. And yes, the New Democrats have been pushing government spending as well—particularly on infrastructure projects—as well as for education and job training. But what makes the New Democrats different from the more conservative-leaning Republicans who used to represent this party is that some of the New Dems actually believe that government is needed today to help workers, create jobs and protect the environment—and that if government does these things for the right reasons, then it can actually help the economy grow. If this is the case, then there is a big question that remains unanswered: Can these policies actually help people rise out of poverty and the struggle for decent employment? If the New Democrats can't answer that question, then they are more than a little out of touch with the real concerns of voters.	0
The latest in a line of attacks to hit the city of Aleppo earlier this week, Syrian government warplanes pounded rebel held areas of the city in an unprecedented campaign against the rebel-held districts of the city. The airstrikes took place at 7 a.m., the United Nations said, after the first aerial assault of the new conflict. A number of the strikes were reported to have hit residential areas of eastern Aleppo with at least one report stating that at least five persons were killed in the assaults. At the time of writing, at least eight civilians had been reported killed from the airstrikes, but the toll later declined to eight as pro-regime websites claimed their coverage had been "mistaken." Russia and Syria have previously carried out strikes in Syria as part of the ongoing Russia and Iranian intervention in the country's six-year war, which has already killed tens of thousands of people and left millions homeless. Russia claimed it would target terrorist groups in eastern Aleppo, but has been accused of targeting both regime forces and opposition fighters. According to Human Rights Watch (HRW), the Russian operation in Syria was in stark contrast to the campaign against rebel held areas of Aleppo in early January, when they targeted "no-go zones" and civilian areas. "This is Syria doing what Assad is doing in other cities," said Nadim Houry, HRW Middle East director. "The warplanes came in at the same time as the bombing campaign, and the only difference is that now Aleppo residents know they are at the wrong end of the barrel bombs." Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Al-Moallem also insisted in an interview with Lebanese daily Al-Akhbar. He said the bombing of government-held eastern Aleppo is in "self-defense." The bombings had been planned "for several months" by Russian military commanders, Al-Moallem said, according to Al-Akhbar's translation.	0
It's the most exciting time of the year! And we're more excited because we can't wait until it's over. But there's still a whole lot of work to do. And to make matters worse, it will get even worse as we approach the season end. If we're going to get a full season going this year, we need to finish up production on Volume One. We want it to be perfect. Let's work together to not only get everyone on track for next season, but also finish the production of Volume One. It's the beginning of October, and we need you to tell us about the last episode of this season. When Volume Two premieres, all of your support and comments will help bring us a little closer to our stretch goal of getting Volume One out for everyone, because we can't do it without you! With your support, we will get Volume One out to you. That means the perfect set of posters to hang in your living room and on your walls, a volume that is not only complete, but also beautiful. We've already started on Volume Two, including the artwork, story, scripts, and music. Your support will go a long way. But we need to raise around $18,000 for the printing of the posters, the fees for sound design, and to cover any fees incurred during production. Your help in this goal is critical.

A Florida man who told a police officer he had a bomb in his pants was arrested on Monday, a week after he was arrested for threatening another officer, authorities said. William A. Pfeifer, 48, of Deerfield Beach, told Miami Police Sgt. Jorge Torres that he had a bomb in the pants he was wearing, according to authorities. The bomb, which Mr. Pfeifer said was in a water-filled canister, was made of C-4 plastic and contained the explosive Tannerite. It was contained in two packages that Mr. Pfeifer, a U.S. Marine veteran, brought to the Fort Lauderdale Police station Nov. 17. Later in the day, Mr. Pfeifer sent a Facebook message to Sgt. Daniel A. Rodriguez telling him he was being chased by a "police state". Mr. Pfeifer also sent an e-mail to Sgt. Rodriguez threatening the Miami police commander with a lawsuit. The last email, dated Feb. 10, said: "I am planning to sue Miami for taking me to jail for nothing, and threatening me in my jail cell." A day after he was arrested, the bomb squad was called in to examine Mr. Pfeifer's backpack, and Mr.Pfeifer was arrested, investigators said. His bail was $75,000. Investigators said it was not clear if Mr. Pfeifer had been in possession of the Tannerite. In a statement, Sgt. Torres noted that "the bomb threat came before the officer's interaction with the suspect," but he also noted that the department is not always a model of transparency."The officer acted within the law and should be commended for it," Sgt. Torres said. Mr. Pfeifer's previous arrests took place in November 2014. He was charged with a felony count of making bomb threats to a community college and the charge was dismissed. He also was charged with misdemeanor battery in November of last year. Those charges were dismissed, prosecutors said. He had received a one-year operating suspension from the police department in 2014 for violating the use of force policy. Investigators said Mr. Pfeifer had a criminal history that includes several misdemeanor convictions.	0

As you'll see, this list focuses only on women with at least a 90%+ rating based on the 10+ surveys I've done in the past year. It's by no means a comprehensive list, but it's still fun and useful as a "starting point". Enjoy. A note on terminology and some disclaimers: These are all "best" games, not the only ones worth playing. I consider "overall" to encompass everything that was well-received by critics and/or is still playable to this day. The only "best" game that's not listed here is Super Mario Advance 3, by obvious choice. Super Mario Land 2 is a game I've heard a lot about lately, but I haven't played it. It might seem odd to have it listed in this list, because Mario 2 looks so primitive today, but I believe the quality is just as high here as in most other games reviewed on the site. I've included a short description of the game below each game, but for most of these games you're on your own and need to find a good place online to find out more. Also, note that some of these games are not in any video game's catalog, either in North, South or Central America (for example, I'm not saying the original Super Mario is NOT in the NES catalog in Europe) and even in Japan. You'll notice that there are some games listed as "Not reviewed", which just means that they did not make the list of the Top 75 Nintendo games of all time (even if I've reviewed those already in the past year or so). It's also worth noting that this is all just a collection of the best games I reviewed this last year, and not a comprehensive analysis of the entire video game catalog. If you see your favorite game listed, share it in the comments by adding links to your own "Top 75 reviews" or something similar. Or, just leave a comment and let me know what you think. A bit about "Best games rated 90+": The "90+" rating is based around two things: 1) which games have been played by at least 5 people (in most cases, at least one person must have had a rating of 9 or higher for the game to count), 2) whether or not those games are from the Nintendo family of system (NES, SNES, N64, Gamecube, Wii/WiiU). This is a bit like the "best game ever" in music, but in gaming, rather than music reviews. Note that the "overall" list does not show any games rated 90+ by the Video Game Critic's Choice awards. I think this is because a lot of "94+" reviews contain games by other publications (or maybe even by GameFAQs). I'd be quite interested to see how many of those reviews are in fact, from Video Game Critic's Choice instead of other sources. I've tried to make the ratings as accurate as possible, but if there's information I haven't listed below, please let me know. This list has been compiled with the help of a few members of the Smashboards forums. Special thanks to "BigSaucey" ("BigSauce" for short) for helping me find some of these games, and to "Cobalt" ("Cobalt" for short) for some of the most obscure choices. Listing the best games to play: Super Mario Land 2, Super Mario 64, Super Mario Sunshine, Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, Metroid Prime, The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past (aka Legend of the Quest for the Seven Suns) Top 75 Nintendo games of all time:  A note on terminology and some disclaimers:	0
TAMPA — A Tampa woman accused of attacking a former child star on a flight has pleaded not guilty. The Tampa Bay Times reported (http://bit.ly/1i7J1uQ ) that 36-year-old Heather Anne Burt, of North Port, pleaded not guilty Tuesday to a felony assault charge alleging that she punched an off-duty sheriff's deputy in the face. Court minutes show the judge set her bail at $125,000, making her eligible for electronic monitoring until her trial. According to an arrest affidavit, Burt said she got on the Delta flight May 7 with her 10- and nine-year-old daughters and her 9-year-old son. "On the flight, she became upset with an airline employee who was seated across the aisle from her. Ms. Burt became enraged after the employee approached her about playing music loudly during the flight. Ms. Burt told the officer that she was taking her daughters to a park, and that the employee should not bother her," an affidavit said. Burt was arrested when the plane landed in Tampa on Saturday. A video was posted on YouTube showing her punching a uniformed uniformed sheriff's deputy. Sheriff's spokeswoman Amy Harvey said in a statement, "While the Sheriff's Office was very happy to assist in the investigation, Ms. Burt was immediately arrested at the airport upon arrival. The Sheriff's Office will conduct a full investigation and await charging in the case." Burt's attorney, Jim Behan, said in a statement his client was "very proud" she took on the uniformed deputy and that her "reaction to the alleged assault was totally out of character." The attorney said he is "confident this will go to trial, and she will be exonerated once all the facts are known."	0
I am a regular visitor to the online magazine and web site of the World Economic Forum, or WEWS, one of the oldest and most influential international associations in the field of "global issues." And I agree with the WEWS CEO, Klaus Schwab, who recently said: In a word, the global economy is in a funk now, we have an excess of demand…and the result is a decline in demand for imports. We are in a period of "negative growth," with trade not growing, demand not growing and we have a large surplus of exports. In other words, everything is bad. What a concept! All the signs are there. In fact, the WEWS is already starting to change its tune. Not long after Schwab wrote his article, WEWS Director-General Roberto Arias Canete admitted something that I and others have long suspected — the WEWS is not trying to forecast the future. Instead they have always taken the line that whatever is happening in the economy, it's just like everything else you and I are always told to worry about. So in effect, everyone is talking about the same thing, because the WEWS is just another one of those economic forecasts. Arautez-vous le délicat? But no doubt, something very big is happening. One has only to look at the world's stock markets to see the signs and see that this is a trend that looks to be taking off. So what could be causing the "flip" in financial markets in recent months? The good thing is that it doesn't involve a full-scale economic collapse, or even a major recession. Instead, it is a "contagion" in the form of economic slowdown that seems to be spreading from the Eurozone countries to all the rest of world. The big picture I don't have the numbers for you, but I think that by some estimates, there has been a significant economic slowdown in Europe since late 2013, and possibly longer. What is happening in Europe is that the massive, record-breaking monetary, fiscal and social policies that these countries have been engaged in has not only failed badly, but has even triggered a substantial economic slowdown in their economies. The biggest part of that slowdown has happened because these countries, along with other parts of the world, are still dealing with the aftermath of the crisis. This is exactly what the WEWS has suggested. It told us that the problems in the EU needed some time to fade away. But once that happened, the WEWS said it could go on predicting that economic growth would steadily increase in the coming years. In fact, that seems to be exactly what has been happening… and the stock markets are right about it. The EU is getting poorer, and this slowdown means that Europe is getting less and less prosperous. The world is getting weaker Another sign of the impending slowdown in the world's economies is the fact that the U.S. stock and bond markets are beginning to take a beating from the ongoing turmoil in China. For example, the S&P 500 index had a very rough week this week. While the market has gained around 8% over the last twelve months, it lost around 13% this week as investors dumped the stock and bond markets and took refuge in real estate. The U.S. stock market fell about one percent in the same period. In China itself, the real estate market fell about 10% as investors panicked and sold, taking their money out of markets and real estate. The U.S. stock market has recently been on a run up after the recent sell off, but the decline in real estate prices is making the stock market more expensive again. In short, Chinese economic growth is now slowing and in a recession. What is also happening in China and in other developing countries is that many of the companies that are exporting to these nations are becoming less competitive than they once were because they no longer have much demand from domestic businesses. Instead foreign companies are taking their business and moving this way and that in order to gain marketshare. The result is that these nations have had to implement large structural changes to reduce their bloated domestic government budgets and increase the competitiveness of their economies. The WEWS also told us that the slowdown in the world was due to a "slowdown" or "global expansionary depression," or GIGI for short. They described the way we have been running our economies as part of a process of globalization, which was causing the U.S. economy to expand. But that process of globalization is slowing down. The WEWS said this was due, in part, to the fact that the amount of manufacturing in the U.S. has been falling while the U.S. has been expanding. Why is this happening? 	0
The Canadian Press  VICTORIA -- Two police officers have died in a shooting in Richmond, B.C., as they tried to apprehend a suspect during the weekend. Police have identified the officers as Const. Brian Montague of the VPD and Const. Craig Fraser of the Richmond RCMP. A statement issued by the police says the officers were shot Saturday in a residential neighbourhood of Richmond as they tried to arrest "a suspect during an ongoing domestic disturbance." Fraser died on the scene while Montague later died of his injuries in hospital. "No words can express the sorrow and sadness we extend to the two families impacted by this tragedy," the statement says. "Our thoughts, our prayers, our hearts are with them today. And we do so also for the police officer or officers who were involved." The suspect shot and killed by officers on Aug. 20 is still being questioned. The suspect was also injured. A family member of the shooting victim said Friday night that their prayers are with Montague's wife and children, as well as the officers. "They were out in support of their brother, in support of his wife... his kids, his sister, his mother," Brenda Macdonald-Rathier said in an interview. "They were out in support of each other. They were out to put a stop to the violence in their community." Macdonald-Rathier said the family is heartbroken by the loss of her nephew and a cousin. "To know that my nephew was so taken that it affected not only the family and the community, but the whole country... to know that he was killed in the line of duty. It's tragic in every sense of the word," she said.	0
When a girl becomes addicted to pornography, she becomes a broken woman. She is not mentally or physically healthy, or in a functional state of her relationships. When a girl is forced to engage in pornography, she becomes an addict who is unable to break her addiction and be a healthy member of society. This is a very real situation and one where men need to do all they can to assist. Many men want to assist in breaking down the relationship between women and pornography, especially the relationships between father's and daughters. This is a very common, and even a desirable, goal for many men and fathers. As fathers, we believe that both of our daughters deserve a healthy relationship.  Pornography damages relationships between fathers and daughters and it harms the relationship between a father and their daughter, the daughter in the porn industry. Fathers can help break this cycle by being aware of their daughters' participation in pornography, especially the role of mothers and the porn industry. Pornography destroys any meaningful relationship between fathers and daughters because it is so damaging when it is practiced by a parent who is either unaware of its harmfulness to their daughter or, when they are aware, simply fails to take action. When a man has daughters, he has a duty to prevent their involvement with porn and stop their use of it. One possible solution would be asking your daughter's teacher if she will allow her to have internet access in the classroom. You can tell your daughter if she is able to go to school when she can go to the room with the internet. This will allow you to monitor her use of the internet and her access to pornographic websites in a classroom. The second possible solution is to put pornography in the hands of someone that has a better chance for preventing its usage among a variety of groups. The porn industry is very powerful and is very influential in society. A father can be part of bringing down pornography, as long as he is actively involved. One possibility is to put pornography in handbills and pamphlets. You can even have a father write a pamphlet on his daughter's use of pornography, in an attempt to prevent it from forming a part of her life. A father can also put pornography in the hands of the authorities. This is particularly important now with the internet, technology and the amount of people who can access the internet. The government has seen an explosion in pornography availability because the industry will not pay for the creation of new content. It is very expensive when a pornography company pays. If the government creates its own pornography, this industry still would not pay and its users would not get the content or they would not have access to it in the first place. Parents should therefore put the content in the hands of the federal, state and local governments. These organizations will be able to control the content and distribute it to the masses if it is illegal. While there are many solutions out there to help dads fight against pornography, you should be aware that there is one solution which is the best for all involved. This solution is to remove all pornography from your life and prevent it from ever being in the home. You can either start with something such as a monthly printable list of links to porn from all over the internet or you can start now. I recommend this way because the internet becomes available at any moment. I suggest that you have a printable of the list of links. It will help you to remember where all the links are, where the porn is located, and also gives you links right there where you can get on with your day, rather than having to go into the internet and search for the websites. Take a quick look at the following list! You are welcome to print this list and keep it at home. You can also save it and pass it out to your friends. Note: I'm offering the services of the above links free for all who request them. When you are done, take a moment to look at the link, especially if you are addicted to pornography. If you have a daughter, you could tell her what was found, explain how you made the list. It can be difficult to talk to a child over the internet about sexual matters, especially if they are addicted to pornography. When you share a printout, you take away any fear they might have having to talk to you. You may also want to consider getting a copy of the following video:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hJ9kR_XcOQ When you begin researching and looking at the links, you may even find that you are in shock with the amount of information you are able to uncover. I hope that you will find this helpful. Good Luck and may God help you. ______________________________________________________________________________________	0
A few weeks ago I got a phone call from the owner of a company I had never heard of asking if I'd be interested in reviewing his company's products. I was curious. It sounded like a fun idea – a brand with really neat stuff to offer. He wanted to know about the type of product, what we'd evaluate, what we didn't think was important, and what we were excited about. I didn't have an issue with that. After I met with the company's founder, I was told I would be working with a team to help put together a new line of equipment. The first time the team met, I was immediately excited to be working with one of the industry's most talented and creative people. He seemed like a man I could trust. We had a good amount of detail on what we'd be working on (a new monitor, digital camera, and a pair of earbuds – we were excited to be introducing them), the process we'd be taking to get there (we thought this was interesting) and what we would do to test things. Over the past two weekends we put together a group of people to take on this task. We started by doing research, meeting with the company, speaking to their customers, and building prototypes. I've been working in the retail industry for almost 14 years. This kind of work takes time to complete. Some ideas are too big and complex to be taken on with others so we focused on our two main product ideas. We were very careful of how we went about getting there. We wanted to make smart equipment that people could really appreciate and use. The first product we designed was a new monitor. This was a very special monitor, one that would set a standard for others. We began with this product because it required the most detail from we needed to do our work. We needed every single detail that the designer would have to make to take this monitor to the next level. There were so many details to get perfect. This is something we try to stay very true with our product designs. So if you are looking for our top 5 or our top 10, they're all at the bottom of this article. We spent about 9 months working on our second monitor project. In addition to the new monitor we built some other accessories to enhance it further. The end goal for these products was to make great quality devices that are simple to use. Many of us are accustomed to using technology that can make your life easier in so many ways. They can save you time, help you concentrate, improve your energy levels, etc. The technology we want to bring to the market is much more advanced and allows us to focus attention on a very important aspect of people's lives – how they spend their precious time. What we wanted to bring to this market is a monitor that you don't want to take off the wall and use every day for the rest of the day. It's not going to be right for what everyone needs. Everyone will have a different style. That's what makes this market so exciting – it's not just a consumer product, it's something you can use every day to better yourself or your company. We began our journey by finding products that were high quality, but had some very bad reviews. We put a great many hours into finding all the things we really needed to add to these products. Finally, after spending our time finding all these little details, we had a brand new monitor that was ready for prime time. We were ready to meet with this manufacturer. We got to the point where people were calling us (or emailing from their sites) telling us how great this monitor was. Not only did it have a lot of features to help the customer stay more focused, it had a ton of customization choices. Not only could it be customized, but we could modify some of the accessories as we saw fit. It would be such a neat monitor that I wanted to do whatever I could to get it to you. The good news is that we have that monitor with us in the office. It's a fantastic monitor. We can't wait to show you. Unfortunately, that was the end of the first project. We had a similar situation with a video camera we designed. The same thing happened. We wanted to do just as much research and build as much as we could but just could't stay focused until we had a very, very high-quality camera in our hands. We did everything we could to get this project done (we're in the office and ready to go) and then a week later the CEO of a competitor called us. He said they were very interested in this product and if we had the specs we'd be willing to bring it to the market. We told him that we had the specs and were very confident in our product. What this new CEO also mentioned was that he was looking forward to working with us to bring the product to consumers	0

The idea that there's something intrinsically bad about men was never more pronounced than during the time of Victorian England, a time when men were viewed as weak and irrational. So what was it about men that was considered so vile that they needed to be exterminated? In this provocative documentary, filmmaker David E. Moore explores what he describes as a "cult of masculinity" that swept through Victorian England. Drawing on historical documents, his study offers a critical exploration of a social phenomenon that is still felt today. Produced by Michael Schur. Camera by Paul Vipond.

A former deputy head of the New Zealand army has admitted he "didn't always understand" the country's Defence Act, a legal ruling which could have been used to have him imprisoned. "I made some mistakes," Major-General Michael Stirling told the New Zealand Herald. "If it [the court's ruling] is going to be used to take me down, I don't really want to see that. That's my view." READ MORE: * Defence Act could have stopped Kiwi policeman's arrest * NZ soldier's claim against military dismissed * NZ army officer says judge took decision 'out of context' * Wellington-based soldier says she was tortured to death in Iraq * New Zealand police accused of taking up soldier's rape investigation * NZ soldier claims she was raped, jailed after sex assault conviction The Military and Veterans Ombudsman said he was unable to say whether military policy in particular, or the rule of law in general, would have prevented the court ruling, which was handed down at Wellington District Court yesterday. However, he said it could have been used as evidence at a later stage. "We can look at the evidence that was given then," Dr Mike Haines from the Office of the Military and Veterans Ombudsman said. "The key to the defence is the case." Stirling has been placed on restricted duties pending the outcome of the case. His defence attorney, Steve Rogers, said the soldier was very anxious and distressed, and would not wish to comment further. The case related to alleged abuse and neglect of the Army medic in Iraq. Stirling was part of an airlift unit at the Camp Bastion site in Baghdad from 2006 to 2008, which deployed thousands of soldiers there to help build up the security services there. At the time, the medic was arrested and detained by US forces, despite being cleared by an investigating prosecutor. The medic's allegation of rape caused international uproar, and the New Zealand government suspended its relationship with US forces after the incident. Stirling was the head of the Army at the time, and in his official statement to Air Force Base Base on July 15, 2008 that his troops would follow medical orders, he said it would be up to the commander of the base on who should be arrested and punished, and then down to the base commander themselves. The prosecutor in the case, Sergeant-Major Stephen Storr, took the decision that the medic should be charged, and Storr said the court ruling did not reflect any opinion he may have had about the soldier's actions. "The prosecution was not seeking to obtain a conviction." Storr also said there was a difference between the legal process at the end of the day though. "The decision was made by the military judge and not the court." He described the court ruling as "a clear case of injustice". "It's a real shock to those that are involved," said Storr. "It's not been a case of people having to make tough decisions for no good reason. "The case was made fairly, with evidence given and witnesses called to back up that case." Storr said as far as the medic was concerned, he accepted that he probably did not tell Stirling what to do with evidence that had been handed over, even though Stirling was his direct superior by rank. "It was an error by the chief of staff as far as I could see, and a mistake that he should not have made by a commander of a high rank." The ruling against Stirling meant he had to forfeit his rank, and had been sentenced to five months detention. Storr described Stirling as "a man of great integrity, a man with strong character and a man of great integrity". New Zealand Defence Force chief Commander Lieutenant General Peter MacNeill commended Stirling for bringing the matter to the attention of officials at Camp Bastion. "The decision of the court reflects how important it is for all service personnel to follow the rules of military justice and be open and honest with their commanding officers and commanders about these rules." Stirling said he believed he was "fairly represented" when he went to plead his case against Major-General John Wilson. He said he found out a week before it went before a judge that he was not charged with any crimes. "I have been extremely shocked," Stirling said. "I did not do anything wrong, and the whole of my unit did nothing wrong. It's been a pretty shock. "I'm probably not too well pleased to be here for 10 days." Stirling had served in Baghdad with the Army for almost 20 years. He said he was proud of his service and in particular, his part in Operation Tidal Wave in Somalia. "	0
Trying to understand the relationship between religion and politics is like trying to explain a relationship between the number five and the concept of zero. Neither are quite right, and neither are wrong. The two concepts are not quite what one would expect. There are five numbers, all of which are used in a certain way (one is a positive number, two a negative), and yet none of the numbers has a distinct meaning. The concept of zero as this fundamental unit of measurement, where there is no longer any value to be reckoned upon, is perhaps better-suited to being described that way. As I've stated several times in the past, I see religion as something much broader and more complicated than a set of ideas. I see the concept of religion as not only a means of defining and describing the universe, it is a state of mind that can be described as something like enlightenment or being reborn. I would go a step further to say that this experience of having the universe in perfect balance with oneself is like the experience of being fully in the moment. One is fully absorbed in the wonder of it all. The mind gets an unbalanced perspective that feels more like a jolt, it comes with a feeling of being totally lost in a sense, as though one's very being is at a loss. Yet, as the experience goes on, the mind becomes increasingly clear, one loses all sense that this is a real, unique experience, and gradually, after a number of weeks, the feeling becomes an integral part of the person as a whole. If you've never experienced this phenomenon, you might wonder how you are different. To be quite frank, it's something that is not something you'd want to experience in your everyday life. I'm a Buddhist, so it's not likely that most of you experience enlightenment on a daily basis. The same goes for reincarnation, for example. This doesn't mean that we aren't all equal on the spiritual end. For instance, someone who has only had a spiritual understanding of a few years and yet is still as spiritual as they were before is a great example of this sort of experience. This phenomenon is quite a hard thing to conceptualise. Some people may say that one can understand the concept of the five numbers, although I have yet to find something that explains it. I did start thinking about it because of recent statements that Pope Francis has made, like the statement that we need to consider an atheist's position when trying to determine what Christianity teaches. This seems like a very odd statement considering that Christians are so certain that Jesus was born of a virgin and that he was crucified on a cross. Yet, the Pope still has this idea about atheism. I'm not even sure how to describe what I feel for this experience. I know it's not that strange to describe it as "wonderful". However, I feel that it's impossible to know if this sort of thing really happens, and if it has happened that it is an experience that every sentient being has. If an experience like this is so easy to understand, it must have a very large impact on one's daily life, yet it is possible that there aren't even that many of us who have this sort of experience – if that was the case, then I'm in trouble because I couldn't give up this job to spend more time contemplating things like this! However, I wouldn't make the assertion that it is impossible for anyone to experience this. I'm not entirely convinced that I have. However, I do see some aspects of the process which make me think that I am one of those rare people. Like everything else, to understand it is to experience it. And just like every other thing, if one didn't experience it, it would be meaningless. And, of course, we do have a choice in how we experience it – some people seem to experience it very readily, and others may not for a time. However, I believe that it is only those who have this experience who have the ability to understand it. I have a suspicion that the Pope is one of those people. The Pope's statement that everyone should have the possibility to be reborn in God also resonates to my understanding. We are all reborn in nature to eventually find a place we feel comfortable. I also have a sneaking suspicion that he means reincarnation, although it wouldn't be entirely correct to say that he doesn't understand reincarnation, because he is certainly aware of it, it's just a subject that he doesn't really seem to have any interest in. When I was a child, my mother used to talk to me about how to make a good home for those whom we would kill in war. And to me, she was talking about people like me, those who would do horrible things to others for no good reason. This idea was also echoed in one of my favourites movie, Fight Club. In that movie, Tyler Durden (Edward Norton) talks about people finding comfort in their own misery because	0
You don't have to be a math major to know that, on a logarithmic scale, a small difference is a large difference; and in sports, where speed is king, small differences can make large differences. Here are five numbers, five athletes and five states that matter to the outcome of the Big Ten Championship and beyond. 1. Ohio State (4), No. 4 in AP Poll (10-1) In some measure, this is an Ohio State team we have seen before. The Buckeyes have had a stretch of three straight unbeaten titles -- the last one was in 2011 -- and a run of four consecutive top-50 classes. The roster has been loaded: four Buckeyes who have started at least a game and six players who have been selected to at least one All-America team, and not many more. The key is how fast those players have been able to get to their spots. The offense will give Ohio State all kinds of problems but, in terms of this game, it's how well they can execute an intricate, high-speed, up-tempo play at the line of scrimmage. And how well they have been able to get the players to do that. In this game, the defense is going to give some Ohio State problems but, again, those explosive Buckeyes will be the ones who ultimately win the game. 2. Wisconsin (11), No. 9 in AP Poll (9-1) Wisconsin's offense ranks fourth in the FBS in scoring (48.2 ppg; No. 12 in the nation), and its defense is ranked in the top 10 (No. 8 nationally). Its biggest accomplishment thus far in 2015 is avoiding being ranked last at the end of the season -- after beating Michigan State and Michigan in the regular seasons, and then beating Iowa and Purdue when Iowa and Purdue had good performances in conference play. A win tonight could make that streak even longer. If Wisconsin can play for 40 minutes like the Badgers did in the first three weeks (with Wisconsin outscoring its opponents 73-33) then the Buckeyes will likely need to settle for a one-point win. So they'll have to play defense, which they have to do against a Wisconsin defense that ranks first nationally in defense giving up only 5.0 yards per play. If Wisconsin can stop the Buckeyes' receivers, then the Buckeyes should have a good chance of scoring, and to stop those Buckeyes, the Badgers should be able to apply a pass rush to the Buckeyes. Wisconsin's best chance to win this game might be from turnovers. A strong defensive turnover margin is what gives Wisconsin its identity and, if the Badgers can be disruptive throughout, they can be a player that Ohio State will have trouble with. 3. Michigan (12), No. 8 in AP Poll (9-1) Michigan's offense has been the best in the division the past two weeks, the way it scored 21 points against Ohio State and 41 against Nebraska. Then the offense had a three-game streak of scoring fewer than 20 points. After that streak, though, Michigan scored a season-high 44 points. And after that...well, the numbers were the numbers. In the past two games, the Wolverines averaged more than 42 points per game; in the loss to Nebraska they averaged a mind-blowing 55 points. That Nebraska game was a back-and-forth affair where the Wolverines had the ball and were leading by a touchdown in the late stages, but Michigan couldn't score. In any other circumstance this game would have been a walk in the park for Michigan, but for the Wolverines' inability to get to the middle of the field, the Buckeyes are going to score big. 4. Illinois (13), No. 8 in AP Poll (8-2-1) In its two games against Purdue and Indiana, the Illini offense has averaged 48.7 points. After a win over Illinois State, Purdue came to Champaign and did the exact same thing. But the Illini defense -- ranked second nationally in points allowed per drive (2.57) -- will be key for the Illini. Purdue's offense, the reason it has won four of its last five, averaged 40 points per game in those four games, and the Badgers' offense has been solid against the Big Ten's bottom-five schedule. The only problem is that Purdue is at home and a lot of that Illinois team from the past two seasons has disappeared: the Illini defense was a little better last year than this year for some reason. I suppose that could happen again. 5. Michigan State (10), No. 2 in AP Poll (9-1), No. 3 in Coaches Poll (11-0) I'll be honest: I'm trying to keep an arms-length perspective on the Badgers and Wolverines in this game. When they were ranked 11th and 12th, respectively, I	0
The Obama administration is considering allowing the government and major phone companies to share "bulk collection" data with each other, according to The Wall Street Journal — a move that would significantly expand the agency's ability to share information with the National Security Agency and other allies on domestic terrorism investigations. According to the report, under a new proposal being considered by the National Security Agency and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the U.S. government and companies like Verizon or AT&T would be able to share "all the telephone records" of every American from Verizon's main data centers. Companies would still have privacy rights over that information, but as much as 90 percent of it could be shared directly by the government with its counterparts in other countries.

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Haji Mohammed Ali al-Attash (died December 26, 1985) was an Iraqi jihadist, a leader of Saddam Hussein's Baath Party and one of the chief architects of the Iraq-Iran War,[3] who was killed on March 5, 1985, in an air strike targeting the Baath Party headquarters in Baghdad and the Iraqi National Guard, killing about 1,000 people.[1][2] His death was widely reported, even in the New York Times.[3] He was also known in the West as the "Axis of Evil" for supporting the Soviet Union during World War II.[4] Background [ edit ] Haji Mohammed Ali al-Attash was born in Baghdad on April 16, 1930, to Mohammed Haji Yahya al-Attash and a woman identified only as Aisha. After Haji Mohammed's father died when he was young, his mother gave him to his uncle, who became a member of the Baath Party by 1936 and a deputy to President of Iraq Rashid Ali al-Hussein. By 1938, Attash was appointed to a position within the Party. Attash joined the Baath Party and was promoted to a position of military deputy to Saddam Hussein. This promoted him to the rank of colonel.[5] When the Iraqi Communist Party launched a general strike on September 3, 1950, Attash called a meeting of Party members and explained that the government was a tool of the imperial powers and that communists had to cooperate with the government. The meeting approved his proposals and the strike was immediately ended. Haji Mohammed Attash and Haji Ali Hassan al-Iraqi A year later, he was expelled from the Party when it was discovered that he advocated armed resistance to the government. He also spoke out against the creation of the Iraqi military after the First Gulf War. However, his criticism caused him to be banned from the Military Intelligence Section for five years, and, eventually, to be imprisoned after the United States bombed the Ministry of Defense on August 19, 1961.[6] He claimed that the bombing was a violation of the Geneva Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded and Sick in Iraqui in September of 1961; he also claimed that it was a violation of his right to be heard. This case was heard before a Military Court under the Military Tribunal and General Court Act for the Iraqi Soviet Friendship Treaty and for Terrorism.[6] However, after a lengthy court battle, the court ruled that Attash's statements had in fact been well within what was permitted as a matter of freedom of speech; however, there was evidence that the charges leveled against Attash were not supported by proof.[6] Attash's arrest and imprisonment provoked protests by Iraqi dissidents. On 28 February 1961, Attash was transferred by a firing squad to the Military Intelligence prison. He remained in the facility until October of 1962.[7] Attash first entered the political arena by endorsing Saddam's first presidential bid in January 1962. During the 1960s, Attash wrote articles criticizing the government, writing that it was "a government made of criminals and robbers who preyed upon the public good." Attash's first act as a political leader in 1963 was to establish an opposition party, with a branch in Baghdad. Atta was elected to the Iraqi parliament in 1964, and then later became a minister in the Baathist government of President Gamal Abdul-Nasser in 1968-1971, and held various ministerial posts in the government. In 1971, he was appointed to the position of governor of Basra province. He was also the chairman of the Baath Party's Political Bureau, under which he oversaw its day-to-day operation. However, the party was banned in 1972, and Attash was arrested on 27 March 1978 by a special counter-revolutionary group led by Saddam, and eventually killed by a firing squad in May, 1985.[2] Political career [ edit ] Attash spent the last thirty years of his life working in the offices of the Baath Party under the Iraqi Communist Party, and, in 1967, founded the Iraqi Socialist Party. During his life, Attash was a member of the Iraqi Communist Party, the Iraqi Socialist Party, and the Baath Party. His positions varied between a Communist and a leftist.[8] Attash began his political career supporting Saddam's first presidential campaign, but changed his mind when the Baathist party attempted to ban political opposition. Atta then switched his support to a radical faction of the Baath-led government which was opposed to the moderate faction. He began to oppose the Baath policies of nationalization of property, which he viewed as taking away private property. He supported the Iraqi Communist Party's call for an end to Soviet pressure in the Middle East, and was also a supporter of Iran. In late July 1971, he attended a demonstration in the streets of Baghdad at which the Baath leadership	0
Marijuana plants grow at Kannapolis Valley High School on Feb. 27, 2007, in North Carolina. Marijuana has been legalized for recreational use in the U.S. High school senior John R. Pinto started getting stoned at age 12, and it "was like nothing I'd ever been exposed to," he told VICE. It was the best high he'd ever had. He remembers "a lot of the kids at school saying they had smoked weed before, and I thought, 'Wow, is this really what it's like to have this effect?' " But as teenagers, Pinto says he doesn't go around "smoking weed anymore." As states like California legalize weed for recreational use, kids like Pinto like it because it makes them less prone to stress and helps them focus better. "When you're high, you don't make mistakes that way. It gets you in a better state of mind, and you don't get so stressed out," he told VICE. But even Pinto admits pot isn't a great drug for everyone. It can impair cognitive function, cause cognitive loss, anxiety, and paranoia, and even trigger the development of drug-use disorders like marijuana addiction, according to data from the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA). And for teenagers like Pinto, those harmful effects can be amplified by other factors like the stress of trying to do a good grade, the pressure of trying to find a good partner, or other difficulties and challenges in their lives that make it hard for them just to hold down a job. For people like Pinto, marijuana is like a "medicine" to help them through a hard period. "When I'm high, I don't make mistakes. I don't care as much about school. All my problems I'm better at dealing with when I'm high on weed," he says, noting his high school "was like a prison." John M. Pinto. Photo via WikiMedia Commons But that doesn't mean he uses weed to get high. In fact, the 25-year-old says he's only smoked it once, which he doesn't recommend even when he can. "I don't smoke weed for the high. I smoke it because I smoke it all the time," he told VICE. "I don't really like its effects. I'm not into the feeling of high. I mean, I've only had cannabis twice in my life." To get high? Like Pinto, most people who try pot find it to be more a "medicine" than a drug like heroin or cocaine. But there's no doubt that cannabis is a good medicine for people with medical conditions. In fact, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) even issued a recommendation in 2011 stating that medical marijuana could be a viable treatment for AIDS patients. Mental health experts agree, but they say it's best to understand that marijuana isn't just the "weed" it's often associated with, and that it's most often seen as the medicine. People's motivations in using marijuana to treat mental health conditions vary. Marijuana can help people in other ways, too. "Marijuana is a very effective medicine for a lot of people who need to manage pain and nausea. There's some evidence that people can have a lot of the same benefits that people get with smoked cannabis, for example, as with opioids, which is a much better drug to use with," Jason Papp, the executive director of the Colorado chapter of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws, told The Denver Post in February. For young people like John R. Pinto, cannabis feels more like a "medicine" to help them deal with stress and focus better. Photo via WikiMedia Commons However, that benefit is limited. Many studies have found there are no significant long-term outcomes for patients using medical marijuana. Still, the substance remains legal in a handful of states—including Colorado, Washington, Oregon, Alaska, and Washington D.C.—and a number more states could soon join it. But the federal government has a different view. As it continues to work toward an April 20, 2016 deadline to legalize recreational weed nationwide, the Obama administration is cracking down on states that have taken steps to legalize marijuana for recreational use by adults under 21. Under this policy, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) has been threatening marijuana businesses that have grown or made money off states' legal weed markets—like those in Washington D.C. and Colorado—with civil asset forfeiture. According to a July letter from DEA Acting Administrator Chuck Rosenberg, the agency will not interfere with or "interfere with the enforcement of the Controlled Substances Act" by those jurisdictions, even if they're operating in accordance with state law. As part of its policy, Rosenberg says marijuana businesses and consumers	0
MARK ZUCKERBERG, AP Business Writer WASHINGTON (AP) — A federal judge in Texas denied Friday a bid by President Donald Trump to bar an employee of the Environmental Protection Agency from testifying about his interactions with Trump. The Department of Justice filed a brief Friday in a lawsuit brought by David Bernhardt, who is an EPA employee based in Dallas. In his lawsuit, Bernhardt said Trump has violated the constitution's emoluments clause by accepting financial payments from foreign governments. The Justice Department said in its Friday filing that Bernhardt "sought to enjoin any future emoluments-related investigations."	0
When his family was searching for the right home for him, a couple in Florida had an unexpected surprise waiting for them. "The first thing I said to my mom is that I'd love it if I could move in," he said. After his family searched homes in several states and got lucky on several occasions, they found their dream home. He told NBC 4 New York that "It's really nice, it's nice." The family moved into the tiny home for $50,000, less than what it would have cost to buy a three-bedroom house. The family took out an mortgage to help cover a down payment of $25,000, and the rest was covered by a $30,000 tax credit that a tax prep business helped them obtain. The property is in the community of Okeechobee, about 45 minutes from Walt Disney World, and is part of a cluster of affordable rental homes. In another rare find, NBC 4 NY reported that a New York family found a six-bedroom house for just $100,000, despite many offers. "It feels like the housing market is still really shaky," said Jim Schilling of real estate firm JLL. "It hasn't really recovered from the recession." But he added, "(It) was really very lucky they found that house," because "If it was right next door to them, it would have been priced much higher than it was." NBC 4 New York reported that prices for new homes are going as high as $800,000. The Associated Press contributed to this report. Copyright Associated Press / NBC New York	0
This is part of our ongoing series, "On the Road to Zero Emissions". Join us in our exploration of climate engineering and beyond through our weekly live livestream, and our other video content. Lately, the news has not been great for global warming. First, President Trump took some action on the topic, announcing a pair of executive orders to withdraw the United States from the Paris Climate Agreement. Then, in February, the New Zealand government announced that it would seek carbon offsets and other greenhouse gas reductions for all ships that use the country's ports. Meanwhile, other countries are moving in the opposite direction. In November, the German government announced that it would ban all new coal plants by 2022 and replace coal with renewables by 2050. For some people, those events, or the political climate around them, signal a return to the past. "We are getting close to the point where we can safely phase out coal power and return to what we did in the past," said Greenpeace's international climate spokesperson, Alex Loms. What's the alternative? According to scientists, many of the measures put forth by other countries are not feasible, or even environmentally sound. What's more, many have also been criticized for pushing away low-carbon energy sources and putting climate targets at risk. But it's still possible to move in the right direction. "You cannot shut down any nuclear power plant in the world – including the two most polluting in terms of CO2 emissions," explained Loms. In response to recent political pressure, France has announced that it will close down the last reactor at the now-outdated Chalk River plant by 2017. Japan's Kyushu Electric Power plans to close its No. 11 and a pair of nuclear reactors in Sendai in 2018. This week, South Australia announced that it would close its brown coal-fired power plant at Abbot Point by 2019, joining Germany in its phase-out plan. "We're still in the process of getting back to fossil fuels," said Daniel Hirschmann, a climate scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. "The challenge is that the climate challenge is still there. It's harder to decarbonize and transition to clean energy and do it quickly. For example, we've still got to do everything we can to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in cars." So what should we do? And who should pay? What should we do? The short answer? We need a global plan and funding to accelerate the transition away from fossil fuels. In fact, that's the focus of the Clean Energy Ministerial that will convene in Berlin on January 26. But while much of the focus has been on the US and China, an international solution must include Canada, which is also in the midst of planning for an end to coal-fired power. It may also require other countries to rethink their reliance on coal to meet their climate commitments. As of Wednesday, Australia has joined China, India, and South Africa in pledging to phase out their carbon emissions by 2030, and the UK is expected to announce its pledge later this month. There will also be announcements from other countries in 2017 and 2018. All of this should make it all the more difficult for countries to turn away from their fossil-fuel-based carbon dioxide emissions. A recent analysis from Climate Action Tracker has estimated that the world will need to reach a net-zero emissions target for 2050, meaning the total amount of CO 2 emitted by human activities could drop to zero. This comes on top of countries having already committed to the internationally-agreed agreement in Paris and countries around the world already doing more than 100 percent renewable energy. Meanwhile, many states in the country are actively planning for renewables. "Our goal should be to have 100 percent renewables by 2035," said Massachusetts Secretary of Environment and Energy Richard Blumenthal. While some think they can make money investing in renewables, most renewable energy companies in the United States are struggling. According to a recent survey from the Solar Energy Industries Association, there are only 17% of companies that reported profitability in 2016, and there are concerns that this number has decreased even further in 2017. If companies are only able to turn a profit at a level of profitability of 2 cents, for every dollar spent on financing for renewables, companies will have a tough time competing. In the meantime, the US and Canada now have one another's backs. According to US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, Canada and the United States "are going to be the natural partners in the transition" from fossil fuels to renewables. Canada has set aside $1 billion to invest in the development of clean energy for its businesses and individuals. While the Trump administration is focused on climate change policy, other countries have also made policy changes in recent years. Germany is implementing a ban on coal-fired power, France has increased its ambition for renewables, and South Australia has announced that it will close its old coal-	0
A few months after I first started writing my thoughts on Magic Online at StarCityGames.com, I decided that I wanted a more open format I had a lot of experience with called Constructed. I had been playing a lot of Commander over the years, and I just thought that I would like to explore it further, but I hadn't built around a format before. In the fall of 2005, I found Magic Online and tried playing on it with a couple of friends. It really seemed like the best way to test for Constructed! My first Constructed deck was my Commander deck. I called it "The Command Zone" as I would put together a lot of cards from a box and build a deck around those cards. I had a bunch of cards for the commander, and a ton of ways to put together cards that would have made a good commander. We played a game with cards drawn from a basic land, and in order to win I had to have enough artifacts in the Command Zone to do so! We had a lot of fun with this deck, though we eventually ran out of artifacts... I had four copies of Urza's Legacy from back in the day, so I used those. During this time period at home, I was putting together my personal collection of Magic cards, and that became the base for what we played at home with my family. We played a lot of Commander, and every once in awhile, some of my collection would take on a new meaning for a Commander game. I started playing a lot more with Commander games at home, and then I started playing with it more regularly at StarCityGames.com, but I hadn't really built around a format at the time that I wanted to. The other thing that I was interested in doing was testing Magic Online as heavily as possible, and it didn't take long for me to get into a format where I could play a tournament and win it! I started playing with Constructed on Magic Online with a couple of friends and I quickly discovered that it was very similar to my family Constructed deck. If you have a game plan, you can play the same deck over and over again and win a lot of those! It was a lot of fun. I had a deck of cards that I had gotten ahold of. I was playing a version on Magic Online called "The Gauntlet," and I was making money off of selling my old cards for dollars! In November 2005, Wizards of the Coast offered me a Magic Online subscription and sent a copy of Magic with a subscription code to me on December 15, 2005. At that time, I was living on the West Coast, so this was an incredibly exciting opportunity if I wanted to get back into Magic playing a lot. My wife was actually pretty happy about this because they gave me the opportunity to play with my wife's favorite game. So, I decided to give it a try, and that was the beginning of my career playing Magic. My first Constructed tournament was a PTQ in the Bay Area. I got a good finish in the Swiss and made it to the Top 8. I actually had a good finish but was unlucky in the draft. My first match I mulliganed to 5, but my opponent got my lands and didn't mulligan once. The second match was a mirror match with him, and he won the whole thing! I had a lot of fun building and playing this deck, so I moved on to other formats, but Magic kept on coming back. In February 2006, I started seeing more people playing Magic online more frequently, and it just kind of snowballed from there. I ended up winning a Grand Prix with that deck I had been building for a while. Then I went on a rampage in the second-to-last tournament I played in with the list I had built. In January of 2006, I started writing my articles at StarCityGames.com that were in the vein of the articles you find for any other Magic Online online magazine. I wrote a couple of articles on different things and ended up winning one of them! Then I got invited to Wizards of the Coast for the 2006 Pro Tour, and I ended up winning a whole bunch of prizes including a nice custom-built Mox Diamond! After the Pro Tour, I went back to playing the same Commander deck that I had played with on Magic Online at StarCityGames and started winning more tournaments. I started to get a lot of interest in online Magic. This was also around the time that I got introduced to the Magic Online Team Constructed, and I was able to get two of my best friends to start playing this format together. The rest is great history. The format we play now is called Magic Online Extended. The format is pretty much the same thing that Vintage Masters was before it got split into Modern Masters and Standard Masters, but now there is an Extended and a Standard Masters. Each format is a different experience as you try to make different things happen with	0

As you may have heard before, there's another great movie out in theaters this Friday. You've also probably heard that I was recently in attendance at the film's premiere in London, and I'll tell you that I don't regret my trip. Well, I might have a slight excuse: this is one of those rare occasions where I was able to check out both the first and third installments of the Amazing Spider-Man franchise, in addition to a few other surprises. I had the pleasure of sitting in on two trailers for the films, which were first screened in London and then again in New York earlier this month. This was my first time seeing the film in that format, and it was exciting to see some of my favorite aspects of the origin story get a bit more of a screen time in the two movies. Of course, some things didn't quite go as planned during the premiere. I can't take away too much of the fun of seeing Spider-Man fight the Venom symbiote, or the action scenes and character development that were shown in the trailers. The best bits probably came during the Q & A, which I will definitely share with you soon for this week's ComicBook.com. I also got a chance to sit in on the following Q & A session: Question: How has it different playing the Venom symbiote, since there is also a new villain in this? Gavin Hood: A little bit different, but I was playing the clone of the original. I mean, you've always got the same guy. He's just not on screen now… You know it's very exciting, but as an actor, you're always thinking about your character, because the character has changed through the years. He might be more or less interesting, but you know he's not going to last that long. I'm playing the clone of Spider-Man. And the whole fun of being a Spider-Man movie that doesn't have the web slinging of the movies we've been used to is that if these guys are going to be playing like villains, they can come as villains. It's a nice change of pace for everyone involved. Question: What were some of the things that were cut from this trailer to make it into the film? Gavin Hood: Well, you know, I just have to say that I really enjoyed the way the trailer ended with Venom in the sewers of New York and then going into the heart of Manhattan. That's the way I wanted that to start the movie. That wasn't cut. Question: As a filmmaker, what makes it important that these films be unique and different from each other? Gavin Hood: Well, I think that they all have to have their own distinct identity. I think that they all have to be original. And I think that it's an important challenge for us to try and take the films in different directions. Also read: Amazing Spider-Man Sequel Explained – How The First Two Movies Interconnected Question: And how do you think you would describe the story that Chris Pratt is telling? Gavin Hood: My impression is that it's more of a straight up action story. I'm sort of more interested in that, where the movie is taking it. I think it's the same kind of story, where Peter Parker is trying to get back to New York and get a job, and he falls in with somebody who's a little too dangerous to be around. A very nice introduction to him is through his best friend, Gwen Stacy. Not many people know that she was Peter's first crush, and she's probably still the greatest thing about his life. And this woman becomes this very strong ally as the movie moves along. She's very much in the background, but she plays a larger role over the course of the next several films. And I thought that she really brought some life to the role. And of course, all of Peter Parker's friends are there. That was an important part of the story that we weren't able to tell in the final cut of the first one, which was a lot about the school at Peter's high school, and his friends and how he got his spider powers. I thought that all of the characters that we met in that were involved in that story are important, that we'll see some of their origins. And we'll learn all about it. You know it's a lot about a good teacher who is teaching Peter this thing called being a superhero. And then the whole supporting cast of people who help out Peter in his superhero career is going to be important to the movie. Question: It was revealed in the trailers that The Lizard (James Franco) turned out to be Venom, and there has been a bunch of speculation about whether or not that's accurate. Do you think that might've been a little too much to leave out. Gavin Hood: Well, in the new film	0
I'll be honest with you. I wasn't even aware of the phenomenon known as "Sagittarius Rising" until my friends on Facebook, who are all Scorpios, started posting the phrase. When you look that term up in the Merriam-Webster dictionary, you'll find that the definition for that term is a "rising sign of the zodiac." The word "rising" is a bit vague, and it doesn't specify an exact date, but for the purpose of this article, one can assume to be sometime during August. For those of you who didn't know, Sagittarius is one of the more mysterious signs of the zodiac, as it represents the very best and worst of things. It's often referred to as "the horse of the zodiac," which isn't necessarily a bad thing, per se. After all, being associated with the horse is a very positive thing, yet there are several negative traits associated with Sagittarius. And if you can't stand that, this is probably not the sign for you. Also, since we're on a tangent, Sagittarius doesn't really have much of a birth-chart. Regardless of what sign a Scorpio is, they do possess many traits and characteristics that define them in one way or another. And no one knows what those traits are more than us. As far as Sagittarius and the signs they fall under go, Scorpio, in particular, shares some traits with those of the Cancer sign. Sagittarius Rising is a very intense time of the year. Even if you haven't done any hard work in the form of work, it still seems like the sun is making this journey to get here with us. A lot of this is due to the rising Sun, but other factors also influence your situation. For example, a very stressful year can affect Sagittarius in two ways: either physically, or mentally, which can become quite overwhelming. If you have lived a life of constant stress, it can be difficult to break this cycle. We don't have to do this ourselves because each of us is a unique being and can learn to take care of ourselves if we want. We're capable of dealing with these kinds of things, so what can you do to make this time of year better for yourself? Start doing the things that matter to you If you don't do anything, by the time the sun arrives on August 15th, your mind has been prepped for what to expect. This means that everything you've been doing, whether it's work, school, volunteering, or even socializing and being with friends, will all be over. It is very important that you do what you've been doing. It can be tough, but when we stop being motivated, we will fail when the storm hits. If you really want to be the best, then you need to go out and keep on working. You would do this because you want to make your parents or teachers proud of you. It is really important that you keep working. The best of us do whatever it takes. And the best of us work for something that matters to us, something that matters to others, and something that is truly meaningful. Once you make this decision to put your heart and soul into your work, you will see it pay off in big dividends very quickly. You will be in charge, which means that you will have complete control over your own life. Once the storm passes, things will feel a little more relaxed as well. This is especially true if you keep yourself motivated, which will help you with the next stage of the challenge: The storm is over and now things really begin… Preparing for the New Year This is why I am telling you to prepare for the storm. We have to take it upon ourselves to build what our hearts and minds are calling to put into place. There is no other way we will know what to do. And for the first time in awhile, it feels so exciting to take back what we have lost in the last year. It can be difficult to believe your own eyes, but a few pieces can help make you more positive and help you get ready for the New Year. It was last week that I had the opportunity to see a movie called I Love You, Man. It is one of the most controversial films to be released this year, but I have been a huge fan of the movie for a very long time now. Even so, it was a little strange to see it because it involves a male character who has lost his family, so I guess it was somewhat timely that it came out at this time. Although the movie was difficult to watch, I was able to identify with the character from the moment he says "I Love You…Man" and goes up to a woman who has been the same way. He tells her she's beautiful, that she is strong, and that she doesn't need his	0
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has on September 18 signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with China to jointly explore in the Spratly Islands of the Spratlys and Paracel islands in the East China Sea. This "expeditionary joint working group" agreement is subject to the approval by the U.S. Congress, according to the Pentagon website. The MOU is significant because it "will mark a new phase in the ongoing U.S.-China dialogue that seeks to improve military-to-military relations," according to the military. This MOU is designed to facilitate the U.S. military's efforts to conduct an observation mission and to conduct a scientific survey of the two artificial islands. The MOU comes after China's recent military maneuvers that coincided with the U.S.-China Strategic and Economic Dialogue.	0
There are no reports that the police are asking about whether any individuals were under duress or under the influence of drugs. This comes more than a month after Michael Brown was shot and killed by Darren Wilson, a white police officer in Ferguson, Mo. — a police situation that is still being investigated. "People are going to be hurt, people are going to get hurt on their side, on our side, everywhere," said the officer who helped Mr. Brown escape. "It is going to happen." Mr. Brown was shot several times about 9:18 p.m. on Aug. 9 in the police response to a call about someone possibly breaking into cars at an isolated intersection. The officer stopped Mr. Brown without provocation in a vacant lot, then ordered him to get on the ground. Mr. Brown put his hands in the air but failed to comply, according to the police account of the incident. A struggle began between the two, prompting the officer to fire several shots. Police found the body about half a block from where he had been stopped, wearing only the one-piece Nike track suit and a white T-shirt on the way to the police station. Photo Some witnesses told local media that Mr. Brown appeared to be fighting the officer while Mr. Wilson fired his weapon. The state medical examiner, Dr. Daniel J. Messel, and a grand jury have not determined whether the officer's shooting was self-defense or criminally negligent, according to interviews in The New York Times with a dozen law enforcement officials and outside experts. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Law enforcement officials and private analysts described a complicated investigation that has relied on a variety of tools, from tracking cellphone signals to watching security video. A St. Louis police official said detectives had spent about $18,000 on surveillance equipment to photograph the area where Mr. Brown was shot and examined it using high-tech equipment.

I am working on another project, a small, simple app with a very small memory footprint. To be more specific, it's about a string which contains a "c" and no more spaces.  Here's the current strings: "c#,#,c" "c#,#,c#,#"  You should be able to see in memory all of these strings. I should get all of them back on one run as there's no data I am retrieving from the database.  Now go ahead and do the following thing (and the following will depend on what OS your are running on): (Note: this may or may not work on your computer but since my laptop is a Mac, I won't assume any other OS's will actually work) open a new tab and navigate to the directory where you are currently working and copy the C:\c\string.m file and rename it to C:\c\string.cpp. open a new tab and navigate to the directory where your C++ program is and copy and rename the C:\cString.m file and rename it to C:\cString.cpp. Then open your program in Visual C and, with your cursor on the C# input type, right-click on it and then choose "Inspect the namespace". You will open in a new tab under a new window with the following text: using System; using System.Collections.Generic; using System.Linq; using System.Text; using System.Threading.Tasks; using System.Runtime.InteropServices; Change the name of the namespace from "String" to something else. That's all you need to do now. It's now time to get the string to return. To do that, you must go and find an existing method called GetString, which is one of the base classes of all C# string types and which I mentioned above. You should see it under the "System.Collections.Generic" namespace. Now, this method is just a wrapper around the String class but you can find this method in a few classes: System.Text.RegularExpressions System.Text.IConvertible System.Text.RegularExpressions.ICaseBound System.Text.RegularExpressions.ICaseBoundMatch  To replace the String.GetString with the method you just found, all you need to do is pass in this string to the ConvertFrom method on the method of your choice. For example, you can replace our string with this string: <?xml version="1.0"?>  <?xml version="1.0"?> <!DOCTYPE ScriptBase PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD ScriptCore 1.1//EN" "http://www.docdroid.net/doc/ScriptCore/1.1/ScriptCore-1.1.dtd"> <Scripts> <Script> {string} convertFrom = new string(getString(getSystem.StringToRawText(c), Convert.ToStringOptions.AllCase)); </Script> </Scripts>  Notice that all that is left after the ConvertFrom is this string: "<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" standalone="no"?>"  Now, once we have the "string" object, we can do the following: string str = c.GetString; if (str == null) { Console.WriteLine("Empty string"); return; } int n = Convert.ToInt32(str.Substring(0, n_in)); Console.WriteLine("%d", n); string str2 = str.Substring(n, str.Length - n_in); string str3 = convertFrom(str2); if (str3.HasLowerCase()) { Console.WriteLine("%d", (n > 0) ? n : 0); } if (str3 == null) { Console.WriteLine("No result"); return; } Console.WriteLine("The content of str : {0}", string.Empty(str)); }  This will output the following: The content of The content of The content of The content of As you can see, if the string str contains no spaces or commas, or if the string str contains extra whitespace (or if the string str contains any other characters which are not allowed by the C# strings language) then it will get automatically converted to a string of the correct length, which is the number of spaces and commas that have been removed from it. The method can also be implemented in a	0

CAMEL TREE ORGANIC ALDI (WAL-MART)  "Health is not cheap" Al-Bashamah Al-Shaykh Abdullah Al-Fahd (May Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) *  "Health is not cheap" Al-Bashamah, Shaykh Abdullah Al-Fahd, a prominent Shaykh, who was well known in the UK, USA and Saudi Arabia for the great efforts he has made in promoting health-consciousness and good living.  The book he wrote is written in the Persian language using the Arabic script, which was very popular in the 7th century. It is regarded as one of the great works of medicine in the ancient world. In this work are also the first known works on hygiene and nutrition, with a clear recommendation of using spices for the purpose. The book can be purchased from Amazon.com (Click Here) or any other retailer who would sell books in the world.  The name of this book has many meanings, which may help to understand it.  1. Al-Bashamah, The Arabic word 'Husn', (which means 'Health',) means 'He who cures (Al-Wafa') and 'He who promotes (Ahnaaz)', according to the Shari`ah.  2. Al-Bashah means 'The cure' which was also used in other medical works.  3. The title of the book is 'The Health-Oriented Person' ('Al-Husn al-Mujaan). It is named after the Prophet Muhammed who said: "Whoever becomes the best of persons will be as they (your family members) are in health and the best of (your) family is the one who is in health, and Allaah is Most Great, Most High." [Ibn Majah (20/82)]  The book is based on a very important principle:  1. The person who is very well and healthy is a person like Allah, and he must be protected.  2. This protection must be in Islam, which is the basis of the protection, i.e. it goes from the person to the Creator.  3. All of us have the freedom and the right to take care of ourselves, but the protection and care should be based on Islamic law and the Qur'an.  The idea is very simple. It is quite possible to become well or to be healthy, but to become healthy and to be well depends on Allah, so we should follow the Qur'an in all things, and not be influenced by the outside world. This book has many excellent points in it. It is the work of a man who tried hard over the past 80 years to follow Islam, and to follow the teachings of Allah, and he was respected and sought out among various groups and societies, as I say, by the different Islamic groups. I can't speak to the importance of the book, because of its age at this point and its length, but it is very clear and concise. This type of work was used in the ancient world, until the Arab conquest in the 7th century brought about a cultural change, which affected the health care system in Arab countries. The Arabic language was a difficult language, as it is today in the West, so people often used other languages. The work of a contemporary man in Arabic was so powerful and convincing that it could convince even illiterate Arabs, and even some Arab tribes which were previously non-Muslim, to take the teachings of Islam into consideration in their health and social life, including giving more healthful food, and taking less alcohol as well.  It is a great book to read when the need arises.  I must also note that if an Arab in his or her own country is to be treated well, the best physician is to take the recommendations of those who have succeeded in a good or even excellent health. Therefore, the book is not really an Arabic medical manual, but a personal, practical guide for an individual living in a Muslim-majority country which had achieved such a great level of health, and who will need the advice of an excellent physician, in order to achieve good health. The title of this work is Al-Husn al-Mujaan, which means 'The Health-Oriented Person'. It is named after the Prophet Muhammed who said:The book is based on a very important principle:1. The person who is very well and healthy is a person like Allah, and he must be protected.2. This protection must be in Islam, which is the basis of the protection, i.e. it goes from the person to the Creator.3. All of us have the freedom and the right to take care of ourselves, but the protection and care should be based on Islamic law and the Qur'	0
When I was little, we used to play one-player chess. I'm not sure why, but since one player in a game is usually the dealer and the other player is the Queen, I think that might have been its reason. It's much easier to understand that way than dealing with three players simultaneously, which requires thinking both at a very high and a very low level. Anyway, we did it and we learned a lot. Then, later on, my father and my brother decided that the game had lost its magic. It was not much fun to play with a full house of players at the table. My sister and her friends and I went to a friend's house and played with several other friends. That game took a lot of planning, planning, planning — and that was what we played the most. And it never seemed quite the same again. I think that one could learn a great deal from playing a board game with a full group of players. The main advantage of playing in a group is that the entire group is involved with the game, all of them participating in decision-making, and so on. But it is not necessary for a game to be board-game-like in terms of the game itself. I've often found that game mechanics are not much important. A game is what you do with it, not what the technology is that provides the playing interface, where the player interfaces with a physical board or with a screen or with an electronic device. On the other hand, I like the simplicity of play that often develops when people learn how to play a game by themselves. I think that one could learn a great deal from playing a board game with a full group of players – that's my personal belief – but, as was seen with chess, a group of the players can also be very dangerous. My best experience of that came at a board game convention for children with whom I was playing chess, and I got very, very bad with those kids, even though I thought I was playing well. They would often try to cheat the opponent – which is very dangerous, of course – by trying to move their pieces before their opponent's, by "shuffling" their cards. Sometimes the cheating would be done in such a way that it was hard to tell for sure what their cards did. I think that it's probably worth teaching children to play games like chess and checkers by themselves, even if it's only as a learning tool. But as a general rule that probably should not be done at board-game table-level events, and certainly not at games conclaves or conventions where they can bring with them their own games that are more complicated than a game like Chess. I used to have this very strange fear of playing a board game with a group of adults. I have always had difficulty playing chess with adults, and I've always had great trouble with games like Chess against the Machine. And I've always thought it was a very interesting thing when you play chess with adults and you don't feel like you are cheating the other players and you have to pay attention and keep track of every single thing. But when you play a two-player game with adults and not only are you cheating your friend and taking part in these interesting intellectual and creative debates on how to play a game of Chess or Risk, but you are also losing a lot because your friends constantly take points from you on this "game," the game is not very good. And the reason is that it's not a real game, it's a chess game. But, as I said, even in chess, the adult rules can be just as challenging, and in fact are sometimes a lot more challenging, than the children's rules you get for free if you play some of these games with your children who are older than you. So if there is a group of people that is going to play board-games, I'd suggest that you play those games only with other adults. Just as it's not OK to play with children. So I don't think I have much to add here. But let me make a few comments. In the last few years, I've thought of teaching some "kids" games to adults: Pandemic, Terra Mystica. I don't know if that's going to be possible given the technical issues that would have to be dealt with as far as the graphic and audio quality went, given the age of the players and the age differences among the groups of players that would have to be accommodated, and so on. If, nevertheless, we can do it, I'd be interested in trying it. Also, I would love to try playing Terra Mystica with someone who was not an adult. I think that would be a very interesting experience too. The basic idea of Terra Mystica is that the players play as colonists on a starship, and then they have to solve puzzles to get the different treasures that are strewn across the ship. There is some kind	0
If you have a hard time remembering the difference between those two things, you might want to read the comments on this thread. EDIT: Oh hey, the first comment wasn't me. It was a guy called randy_m. I'm an avid "Frozen"-movie fan and am a great fan of "Anna and Elsa" from Disney's "Frozen." I also have a great sense of humor, so I wasn't going to insult him or call him out about the spelling of his movie. In short, we were talking on the phone. I didn't expect him to call me back after a few minutes. I had planned on leaving the number on the call, but there were people else who had the same number. Turns out it was an amazing thing that happened. When I came across your question about the difference between "Frozen" and other Disney movies and shows, I had to get back on the website and check. I must say I am a great fan of your movie and want to tell you a few of my favorite details. A couple of months ago, your friend asked me what was the difference between your song "Do You Want to Build a Snowman?" in the song "Let it Go" from the "Frozen" movie. I replied with "There's no difference between the songs in "Go" and"Can we?" In that particular song, Elsa sings the line "What is life, if not what we want for ourselves." The line was a direct quote from a lyric from Alan Menken's "Annie," which I thought was particularly relevant to the "Let it Go" song from the "Frozen" movie. I'm not sure if she heard I responded to her but I hope she does. I will definitely reply when it comes my time! In addition, if she comes back, she can ask for my autograph or a picture of me on stage with Anna! 😉	0
AUSTIN, Texas, Feb. 18, 2014 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- (Marketwired - Feb. 18, 2014) - NU Capital Partners (the "Company" or "NU CAP"), a leading early stage cannabis investment fund and management company, announced today that it has entered into an agreement (the "Merger Agreement") to merge with The ArcView Group, LLC ("The ArcView Group"), a leading early-stage cannabis investment fund and management company, under which the Company will (i) become a wholly owned subsidiary of The ArcView Group and (ii) become the primary shareholder (a majority investor) of The ArcView Group and will provide The ArcView Group's management team with executive management services and advisory services.  A full copy of the merger agreement, which is not yet complete, will be forwarded to the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") which, upon completion of the merger, will have 30 days to enter into definitive agreement to the terms of the merger agreement. Upon completion of the merger, the Company will become wholly owned and not-for-profit subsidiary of The Arcview Group. The Company will cease to be a publicly traded entity, will become known as NU Capital Partners (the "New Entrant"), and will file a registration statement (including amendments) with the SEC. The New Entrant will be governed by its own Articles of Incorporation, bylaws and board of directors. NU CAP intends to fund its operations with the proceeds of its future equity offerings, which will be made at a price that is equal to or less than the common stock closing price on the NASDAQ stock exchange ("NASDAQ").  "We are excited and proud to join forces with a long-term leadership partner with a strong track record of successfully navigating the capital-intensive and rapidly changing cannabis industry to bring together our mutual goals and expertise, which were complementary to each other," says Kevin Egan Chairman of the Board of NU Capital Partners. "The merger and our joint efforts will provide NU Capital Partners with a better foundation with which to grow its business and create shareholder value. This will assist us in realizing the full potential of investing in the cannabis industry."  "The ArcView Group prides itself on its expertise and track record of successfully navigating the often challenging waters of corporate investment in the cannabis marketplace, from the inception of The ArcView Group in 2010 to its continued operational and financial success today," said Jason M. Zonenberg, Managing Partner of The ArcView Group. "As a founding partner with NU CAP, we look forward to working together to accomplish our shared goal of realizing the strategic value of cannabis investment funds and a healthier cannabis industry."  "We are delighted that NU CAP has decided to join the expanding cannabis sector as, in its own words, 'a company that builds capital and generates value'. We are looking forward to enhancing our own efforts by leveraging this strong platform, in order to make investments that yield value-creating returns and that will have a positive impact on our industry and the environment that surrounds the industry," says Mike Leventhal, chairman of Zonenberg Capital Management.  "The combination of NU Capital Partners and The ArcView Group provides a unique opportunity for the early stage cannabis industry," said Don Robinson CEO and founder of NU Capital Partners. "The merger will give the Company access to the best talent, infrastructure and capital in the industry, making it the go-to partner in managing the expansion of the cannabis industry."  NU Capital Partners will take possession of all NU CAP's assets on February 22, 2014 and file a joint-stock proxy statement with the SEC with respect to the merger. Following the completion of the merger, The ArcView Group will remain as an operating company and will continue to manage and control NU CAP's assets and other business operations. At the meeting of shareholders on Tuesday February 20th (the "Meeting"), the Boards of Directors of each company will: Establish NUCOR'S EXISTING OFFICERS OF AUTHORITY. The Boards of Directors will appoint one independent director of NU CAP (the "Independent Director") from the NUCOR shareholder nominees list of the prior year to the degree that such director is permitted. NUCOR will appoint one board-appointed independent director of NU CAP to the extent permitted under the Delaware Limited Liability Company Act. NUCOR will appoint two independent directors of NU CAP to the respective degrees permitted under the SEC's bylaws and applicable rules. The Board of Directors will set forth an agenda for the Meeting in a notice to the company from the Board of Directors to be delivered to the company on or before February 27th. NUCOR will adjourn the Meeting and hold a further meeting of shareholders, at which time the Board of Directors (the "Board") will take action and notify the company by the date provided in an announcement to be mailed to NUCOR shareholders with the Notice.

"What will the government propose for their new job?" This question is probably asked by many citizens as well. In a new report the International Labor Organization, ILO (pronounced eye-O-lan-oh), examines this topic. The Organization finds that governments should plan and execute programs for new jobs and their creation, as well as the training of workers for these jobs. A new job, the ILO argues, "is defined as an occupation or type of work where employers are actively seeking persons without existing qualifications as part of their own work forces. In most cases the new work is not yet operational." The ILO's recommendations are based on findings from a survey that it conducted amongst its members. It interviewed workers from 20 nations, including the United States (US), Germany, and Canada. Overall, more than half of them stated that government should "plan, fund and implement a new job program in the short term." These are the most positive answers the survey heard. This article analyzes the implications of ILO's recommendations in terms of their implications for national economies and labor markets. It also discusses questions that remain unanswered, including whether the recommendations could have beneficial effects in developing countries, and what might be more effective at creating jobs and improving economic growth in developing countries. How does the ILO define a new job? The ILO defines a new job as one that is needed because an employment model—for instance, one that requires workers to remain on temporary contracts—is not in operation or is not working. "New jobs can be short-term in nature or are part of an overall growth strategy to increase sustainable job creation and long-term employment stability," the ILO states. According to the ILO, a new job often involves training or upgrading workers for a new employment model. "For instance, there may be a need for newly identified IT specialists who, with some extra training, will be needed to provide IT services to industrial companies," the ILO writes. "Or there may be a need for IT specialists in particular industries with a large need for qualified people. A new job is often created in the short term but there could be some positive effects, such as improved training and skills, which create long-lasting employment stability for the unemployed." As with many other global labor market indicators such as unemployment and wage growth—which will be analyzed in a related article of this series—the ILO defines a new job as a job "where workers have experienced a significant improvement in their economic situation. It is not necessarily the most secure position, although most workers accept it." How do national governments plan, fund, and implement a new job program? The ILO recommends that national governments plan, fund, and implement a new job program in three stages. It is important to do so because the unemployment rate in many countries is high. In the first stage governments should identify the short-term need for workers, for instance with IT companies who are looking for workers to develop new business models. In the second stage governments should develop the new job program and its management system—which refers to how and where to recruit and train workers. The ILO defines the new job program management system as the "plan, structure, and management of the entire enterprise-wide program and associated program activities" of new jobs. In other words, the national governments will develop the program, which will involve various sectors, including education, research, and the government, and also "create appropriate mechanisms for its implementation." The ILO is careful to note that the program will have to be comprehensive with some aspects, like training, going beyond government intervention. Finally, governments should "encourage and facilitate the establishment of employment opportunities for persons in the short term through the creation of new jobs and the creation of training capacity." How can we increase unemployment in the developing world? One way to create new jobs and create better employment in the developing countries is to "bring the knowledge and skills of international experts together with the needs and aspirations of these countries." But this is difficult, according to the ILO authors. "A lack of a coherent and well-organized research and development environment in many developing countries makes it difficult to plan and undertake new jobs. The lack of training capacity makes it difficult for young people to acquire new skills. The limited number of labor-intensive industries, for instance food/agricultural, means that many poor workers do not make the most out of their opportunities that exist." Another way is to provide tax breaks, including exemptions, to companies that invest in training workers. Some countries offer direct financial incentive, such as a tax credit or a direct grant, which is a "positive approach" but there is "a lack of transparency of the system," the ILO authors warn. Another possible mechanism for creating jobs is to provide a tax credit to the unemployed or to young workers willing to return to school.	0
This is my new project, which I've decided to call X-Frequency. The whole concept was hatched during a weekend where I was looking for a project to help get myself out of a funk for a bit. In the mean time, I was bored and wanted to do something different. It seemed like a good idea at the time. The project is intended as a simple way to display multiple frequency signals (including sine and square wave) in a single panel, either as an "electronic guitar" on a rackmount system (like the Korg MS-20), but also as a simple way to display multi-frequency signals in a traditional 3-way rack layout. The idea is simple, simple, beautiful. The source is the very awesome Frequency Master: http://www.frequencymaster.com/ The schematic is below, and the code to display it is below. If you want a real-time view of the signals, try listening to the wave files being generated using VST. That's what everyone has been doing lately. The circuit is very simple: The output of the oscillator is fed to a transistor. The output of the transistor is then hooked up to a variable-speed DC source (I would highly recommend a variable-speed DC supply of some kind, ideally a variable-speed AC supply from a wall-wart, rather than a battery). The output of the variable-speed supply is then fed to the speaker (in my case that's an Ampeg amp, which are usually powered from the AC supply). The output of that speaker goes directly to the speaker output, from where I routed the speaker cables down the back of the unit. The audio signals are a very simple waveform, but I really like their simplicity on the output. They're quite pleasant, and the "sound" that they produce will bring a smile to your face. The schematic is basically a simplified version of the schematic I've used on my X-Wave oscillator/pulse generator circuit: http://www.doble.com.au/xwave The voltage from the amplifier is fed through a capacitor, which acts as the "base of the wave". The power from the oscillator-based waveform is fed back to the input of the X-Wave amplifier, which drives a variable-speed DC supply via a voltage divider circuit, into a switch-mode power supply. I found out that this circuit is good at driving two separate DC voltages, but in my case that didn't work. In that case, I used a 5V linear power supply to drive two separate +16V voltages to the output of the X-Wave amplifier. The output of that DC power supply is hooked in reverse into the base of the oscillator waveform, and then fed back up into the oscillator. This is the same circuit as used on my oscillator circuits, except that I have the circuit on the other side of the circuit instead of the other way around. The only thing I added in here besides the X-Wave amplifier was a variable-speed AC/DC supply. I thought that this was required so that the audio signal from the oscillator could be fed back into the AC power supply, which would improve its stability on the grid. The design is as follows:  The circuit is quite simple:The output of the oscillator is fed to a transistor. The output of the transistor is then hooked up to a variable-speed DC source (I would highly recommend a variable-speed DC supply of some kind, ideally a variable-speed AC supply from a wall-wart, rather than a battery).

SUMMARY As one of the wealthiest nations in the world, the United States should be spending money not on luxury projects but on the people who live in this country. Instead of throwing money into unnecessary and duplicitous programs, the President and Congress should create an emergency budget for basic needs, starting with making college affordable for everyone. One-in-three college students and six out of ten working Americans rely on student loans for tuition. Student loan debt can seriously affect a person's chances of finding a job, and the repayment times can stretch out the lives of students even after they finish school. In the years leading up to the 2008 financial crisis, over $1.4 trillion of student loan debt was accumulated, with the average debt balance in 2012 exceeding $25,000. The average loan balance for graduating college seniors who took out new student loans in 2012 was nearly $30,000. The average borrower pays 6.45% interest and student loan debt pegs borrowers to low or no rates of inflation. When interest rates are higher, debt increases. In response to rising costs, many colleges are increasing the cost of tuition, particularly as the federal government subsidizes the cost of undergraduate education with Pell Grants and loan interest deductions. More than half of student borrowers currently take out loans at or above the maximum for federal student loans. More than half of students who graduated with debt during the recession are making monthly payments of more than one-third of their income. This has led to large delinquencies and default rates as the national default rate increased from 10% of all borrowers to 12% in 2010. Over the last two years, Congress has taken a series of actions to address the current student debt crisis. Congress should now turn to solutions that go beyond merely making borrowers pay interest and fees. SUMMARY OF FINDINGS Overall student loan debt is at an all-time high, with one-in-three undergraduates and six out of ten working Americans relying on these loans for tuition. Over $1.4 Trillion of student loan debt is in debtors' name, with an average student loan burden of almost $27,000. The average student loan borrower receives interest discounts for lower-payments and is saddled with large balance balances. Loan rates for new graduates increased from 6.45% in 2007 to 6.85% in 2012. This is an increase from the 6.0% rate that the Bush Administration proposed for 2012, while the Obama Administration has proposed a 4.5% rate. In 2012, student loan borrowers paid more when paying interest and fees than they were when paying their loans off. Despite student loan debt being relatively low compared to other forms of consumer debt, about three times as many students are burdened with debt today than were burdened with it before the Great Recession. The average debt due for loans taken out after graduation in 2011 was $29,700, approximately the same amount that borrowers faced in 2008 before the economic downturn. Student loan debt affects people of all ages. The majority of student loans are owed by young adults. In 2012, roughly half of the new student lending came from households with students under age 30. In 2012, about two-thirds of all graduating college seniors who took out new student loans were working and earning more than $40,000 a year (in 2012 dollars). Most of the student loan debt is concentrated in 10 states: Massachusetts, California, Arizona, New Jersey, Texas, Connecticut, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, New York and Minnesota.

Pilot, a new drama series based on the book by David Mitchell, will pick up directly where The Twilight saga left off, following a pair of teenage girls from opposite sides of a friendship rift. The new series, which will premiere on PBS in late 2016, will focus on Grace (played by Emily Blunt), a beautiful tomboy whose mother is a successful lawyer who can't stand having his daughter be who she is. Grace comes home for Spring Break to her grandmother's cottage, where she's surrounded by a group of friends, including the headstrong Marnie, who falls in love with Grace and, on the night of their arrival home, disappears without a trace. "Our young characters — Grace, Marnie, and David, who plays her teacher — are all coming of age in their mid-20s, and the central characters from the Twilight books are so clearly relevant," said executive producer and Twilight creator Mitchell. "We wanted to revisit them as they're both in their fifties." RELATED: Read more about the new TV series 'Pilot' Here How 'Pilot' Makes 'Twilight' Into a Modern Classic Here's What You Need to Know About 'Pilot' Pilot will mark the second time Mitchell, who also penned the script for the first series, has taken on a project from his long-time writing partner, Jonathan Tucker.

We've covered the importance of not just learning the game of golf but also the mental aspects of the game from the mental game to the emotional side of the game. Our next step, though, is just as important–we must first get ourselves up the range. I believe it can be done, but it does require some good fortune for some of us. That has happened a handful of times for me in the last few years when my balls have been defective. Once I made a mental correction after being too much behind in my swing and the ball sailed past the hole. That shot, I have to admit, made me feel a bit better about myself about that particular round. But that shot was a long way out from my goal line, and I didn't have too much confidence in my ability to hit a fairway ball at the back of the fairway. A couple of weeks later, I was trying to putt after the last hole of a round. That was quite the uphill climb for me, but I managed to get out a few extra putts and got myself up to 18th place, well behind the leaders. Now here I was again at the last hole with an 18 foot bunker left on the front of the bunker. It was my first hole going out back since the previous week and I was very nervous. I was so confident in my ability to make the putt out to back that I just let off a ball in my back up and missed. My ball was so high up in the air that it just missed the cup. I thought to myself, 'I don't want this to cost me a shot I'm ready for!' I had a little bit of a laugh at myself because in my mind, I just wasn't able to hit a good ball out to back. But once I came out and stood in the fairway looking at the hole I had hit out at out and was wondering how to handle my emotions after putting my club down, I remembered some of my shots from last week and I started thinking, "Okay this isn't that bad." That gave me another boost of confidence and I quickly brought my putt back down the hole and was able to hit it for birdie! As I said, I had a few other putts go that way after that that had me going, "Okay I might be able to hit that." Other times things like that were just very lucky. But the key to doing it is not trying to get more confidence from that putt because you know that's not going to help you hit the one you're actually going for. So if you can't even hit the ball high enough, that usually isn't going to help you out or your confidence boost. But the good thing is, in many cases you can help yourself out because it won't necessarily be your last shot. Just like you have a good mental game for your putting, you have a good mental game for your putting when you hit it to the hole; you have a good mental game for hitting a ball into the hole–you just have to get yourself out the hole first. I think, though, that you can use the mental aspect in your putting not just to get more confident on those putts that aren't all that well timed for your shot–in the long run it's going to help you play better and get closer to more golf balls that go in the hole for the putt. So don't be afraid to get more mental and emotional with your putting. You do want to give yourself a little bit of credit for trying to get the ball out to back in those cases, but you have to go the distance and hit the ball the way you want to be able to hit it.	0
On January 3, 2015, I had the unenviable task of sitting on a panel with two of the top American minds in their fields. The topic: The Future of Work, a topic that every day seems to have a different and sometimes conflicting answer. From a libertarian point of view, the libertarian view is that the government has overreach itself, with its meddling in the affairs of private enterprise and, worse, has encouraged businesses to become less productive. The view from the other side - the point of view of business leaders, economists, government officials and academics - is that the market is self-correcting and that no single agency should have the power to intervene so dramatically in a process most of us prefer to leave to free markets. I have written about the differences between the two sides in detail. But I now think it is time for some general observations to lay this out. First, it seems, at least to me, that both sides have misunderstood their own work. When economists say that the market and the government are not in balance, they are in fact stating the obvious. They are saying simply that neither the market nor government has control over the outcomes they seek. Both sides have, in fact, been working towards an equilibrium that only a market can achieve. They have just made no effort to understand what equilibrium really is, and how to know where to aim to achieve it. Now, let's set aside the obvious point that most economists have a very simple perspective on any given scenario. Even if your view goes beyond this to try to measure social cost - how much money is spent, how much goods are eliminated in a country, and so on - many economists still insist that you do not expect to achieve equilibrium by attempting to use government action to reduce that cost. They will point out that what you have really achieved is to have "doubled the money." The problem in such theories is that you have created a situation that is clearly unsustainable, where costs will be driven higher. This is exactly what some of the world's largest companies are today. Second, economists still appear confused - sometimes literally - about what they think they are doing. If you believe that the main problem with the current state of work is that employers have too much control over the workplace, it's hard to see what you could possibly do to fix this problem. The government already provides the best and most direct mechanism that has proven effective to date. The problem is that the government actually wants to take back control, not to make it better. The government wants to take back government control of labor to the point where the workplace can be transformed into a free and equal marketplace in which the workers are in charge. They want to have everyone leave their job, not stay and make more money than they now must make to survive. (Yes, you heard that right; the people running our nation's corporations do not like to see the people they are paid to employ being paid less than they are worth.) They want to force employees to accept a pay cut, not an increase, so that they will stop hiring so many people and become less productive. They want to do this by compelling the employers to change the terms and conditions of their jobs. They are not interested in improving on the market but in changing what has become the market. Why do all this? Because politicians know where the political hot potato is - the wages under which people can live. They, therefore, seek to push the price of labor down to that level and increase the number of people for whom it's a good deal. And why do employers want to be paid this or that? Well, because they are in the business of making money. And since government can just do what businesses do in the process of making money, you can be sure that government will be the biggest player in the game. As long as the big government players in the game are employers, and since government officials are paid more for advocating the policies that will raise the prices of the products and services businesses deliver, it will not matter how good your ideas are. It will matter that you want to make the government pay your bills. Let me point out, though, even in the face of all this, that the business world has not moved far from where it began. The idea of increasing the profits of everyone and decreasing the wages of everyone is not a new concept. It was a natural result of the free market that took over after the War of 1812. Even then, though, employers thought they had room to increase wages to offset the loss of profits that came from increased automation or from competition from other countries, so they didn't. The result was a vicious cycle of lower employment, higher prices and lower profits, which has led to the current situation, which will only be reversed by forcing businesses to lower their prices. You see, a few steps in the right direction towards ending the problem of overwork can take you a very long way towards solving the problem of unemployment. And	0
The following is a guest article by Jody Lee. The first part of the article will appear in Jody's upcoming book on the "Escape Artists" of the 1980s, "Reinventing The Unseen" Some of the famous escape artists to take up residence in the United States were convicted felons who had no ties to organized crime and were not wanted by law enforcement. Some of these escape artists were so well known that television news stations had a reporter present during their escape. Among them were a number of convicted criminals who had received prison sentences of only four years or less. Others have a very dubious history that is little known to most Americans, but that can be quickly cleared up by reading their stories. They were also the product of a process that included the use of psychological warfare techniques and the use of the media to make them celebrities in the minds of their victims, as well as a means to keep them safe from the police. 1 – The "Bobby" Bias Affair One such escape artist was one of the most infamous criminals to ever take on the task of escaping from a maximum security prison in the United States. Known as the "Bobby" Bias Affair, Bias was not only a convicted crime boss, he had spent fifteen years in prison for two counts of robbery. He had been serving time at Fort Dix in New Jersey, in a unit with the most vicious criminals incarcerated at the prison at the time. In 1987, Bobby Bias was transferred to Dachau, in West Germany, because of a parole violation. The story goes that Bias was a very unpopular inmate in both his unit and the general population at Dachau, but was given special permission to leave in order to attend a court hearing. When he tried to depart, they held him there without charge. It is believed that he was able to contact people in the United States who could help get him out of the country so he can attend an international convention for business associates. In exchange, he would not have to spend the remainder of his life in a maximum security institution. While he was awaiting trial for his second prison break, his wife and son were killed in a traffic accident. He claimed that the accident was an act of God. During Bias' trial, he made an attempt to convince members of the jury that he was completely innocent, and that he was going to die in prison anyway. Bias was found not guilty by a jury. He spent almost eighteen years in prison, and during that time, another escaped prison break had occurred that landed his friend, Albert DeSalvo, in prison as well. Both Bias and DeSalvo, along with five other inmates, had become wealthy from an insurance scam they were involved in with another prison escapee, Paul Kresnik. Some of these insurance policies turned out to be fraudulent. After his trial, he was tried again for his role in one of the earlier escapes, and was found guilty once again, this time with the death penalty. After his final trial, he was given three life sentences without parole. In an effort to gain his release, he approached a man named Joseph Giorgio who was a member of the "Special Activities Squad (SAS) of the New Jersey State Police". He was able to get him out of prison and out of the country via an unusual means of escape. Joseph Giorgio, Bias' former partner in crime who helped him escape from Dachau, was a very close friend of his before they became partners. Joseph had a very good relationship with Dachau Warden Walter Wyszynski. Wyszynski was particularly well known as being unimpressed with the criminal behavior of a few of his inmates. While in prison, Joseph's wife had died in a car accident. In an attempt to spare Wyszynski from getting his revenge, Joseph decided that Giorgio was going to try to sell his story to the media, which would lead to Bias' freedom. Giorgio was able to get two reporters from the New Jersey Star-Ledger to send out a series of stories about Bias who would lead to him being placed into high security prisons. Bias was placed in a cell at the maximum security facility at Riker's Island in New York, and given a nickname that he would later use for himself in his escape. He also claimed to have been beaten by guards throughout his prison years at Dachau. The problem was, the reporters were not very familiar with New York state prisons at that time and never saw a beating committed by guards. After Bias was moved to a secure location, he convinced the media and reporters involved to keep quiet about him in the interest of keeping him out of the media and public eye for his release. The problem that became apparent was that the reporters still wrote about him. In addition, several journalists and media workers who knew	0
It appears that the latest version of Apple's iOS 9.3.3 has a major bug that can cause the iPhone's display to burn through its battery in far-off future without warning. A user on Reddit found that his iPhone 5S battery was draining quickly after installing the newest version of iOS, and it seems like the problem is widespread across the operating system's iPhone 5C/5S range of devices. "It's possible that some older devices may be damaged with iOS 9.3.3, or that iOS 9.3.3 simply doesn't work as expected with the device," the user wrote. "I have an iPhone 5S running 9.3.3 and I've had my charging cable plugged in all evening. This morning at around 3 on a Saturday morning, I woke up to find it nearly dead. I've just checked the battery icon on the home screen, and it has gone from 99% to almost half full, and is still at that level after 3 hours. The charger appears to have worked the whole time, but I wonder what caused the issue." Redditors are reporting the same problem, and most people have not turned the charger off, according to others who have experienced the same issue. As you can see in the first image, the battery icon on the home screen isn't even displaying, since the iPhone doesn't have that information displayed by default, instead displaying "Charging" information. The user is still using the iPhone and his iPhone is still charging, but he said he would likely replace his iPhone with an iPhone 6S after the incident as a precaution. He was able to get the device to charge up to about 70%, but then it just lost the charge completely, and he hasn't had the same problem since.	0
How is the quality of our health and education system affected by poverty? With the help of a newly released analysis by The National Low Income Housing Coalition (NLIHC), we've compiled a list of six things that drive up rates of poverty, all connected. 1. Lack of money to eat Almost half of all public housing residents live in units with severely inadequate heat, and a quarter of them have no access to a toilet. Over a million people are homeless in Chicago each month, and those living on the streets are at higher risk of heart disease, stroke and diabetes.  2. Low-paying jobs Poor people have significantly more to spend at stores, and poorer families spend more of their income on food — often the most affordable and healthy food! Many jobs require little or no skills and no education, including fast food jobs in fast food restaurants, retail jobs such as store clerk and security guard, and office jobs such as receptionist or computer worker.  3. Lack of transportation In Chicago, more than half of all food stamp recipients come from families that are headed by a single mother. But even when they don't earn enough to support their children and dependents, they're often forced to rely on public transportation, and the cost is a heavy burden on households. 4. Poor educational attainment Less than one-third of low income students in Chicago do not graduate on time from high school. In addition, nearly two-thirds of low-income high school graduation rates are significantly below the state average, and the drop out rate is 50 percent higher.  5. Low-paying jobs Low-wage jobs are especially difficult for low income families. And many of them are only available to those with a high school diploma or less. For instance, nearly one in five of low income Chicagoans working fewer than 30 hours a week are working in food preparation and serving.  6. Lack of access to affordable health care Nearly 40 percent of the children in public housing in Chicago are enrolled in public, low-cost or free lunch programs. Children with low incomes have to contend with the health insurance premium, co-pays, deductibles and copays on an ever-rising list of health insurance items, which include drugs and dental care.	0
For as long as we can remember, the United States has been the world leader when it came to incarceration. In 2007, the official American count of inmates worldwide, as calculated by the U.S. Bureau of Corrections, was 1,353,611 and the United States alone accounted for 438,085 of those. And in the last five-year period of 2009 to 2011, the United States prison population surged by over 7,000 inmates per year, which is equivalent to about 10 percent of the global population, despite falling prison populations in Germany, Japan, and other countries. To make matters more frightening for the rest of the world, more Americans are being sent to prison for non-violent crimes. In 2012, the United States imprisoned about 200,000 more people than any other country. If non-violent crimes are excluded from the calculation, the United States now has more people in prison than any other country in the world, except possibly Iran. And despite many of the United States' more aggressive, punitive justice policies that stem from the War on Drugs, the U.S. incarceration rate has gone up over the last decade while other nations that have not been as punitive, such as China and Brazil, have cut imprisonment rates. Given this trend, it probably shouldn't come as a surprise that, over the last two decades, there have been increasing calls to reduce the United States' prison population, including at a United Nations meeting in 2009. But it does appear that a growing number of U.S. leaders are waking up to the fact that American prisons cost less to keep than are our schools, hospitals, and social services. As of April 2012, the U.S. government spent a little over $80 billion per year on its prison system. The Department of Justice, which oversees the Department of Corrections, estimates that the average cost of prisons per prisoner at the federal level is between $15,000 and $20,000 a year. At the state level, these figures rise to $35,000 to $45,000 a year, and the costs are even higher at the local level, with some cities like Newark, New Jersey, paying over $80,000 per inmate. Although this information is relatively new, the fact that these costs are being borne by the American people is no longer hidden from public view. For example, a recent report released by the Justice Policy Institute estimated that the cost of running the prison system in Washington, D.C., could fall to as little as $1.3 million per person in 2014 dollars—a figure lower than the cost of keeping a few hundred children in the city's schools, despite the fact that a single inmate costs about $150,000 a year. This is a startlingly low figure even by D.C. standards, given the high costs it takes to house and feed an estimated 300,000 prisoners, including hundreds of thousands who are locked up for petty crimes and offenses such as prostitution and drug abuse. For example, a single person jailed or incarcerated in D.C. for a drug offense could end up costing the city $1 million in extra legal aid services alone and nearly $2 million in lost economic production from the criminal justice system. There is some indication that other countries are starting to wake up to the fact that the massive incarceration cost the United States is incurring isn't sustainable, and that it is in the country's interest to be a more humane and rational system of punishment. In January, the European Union Parliament voted against ratifying a proposal that would have limited prisoner freedom, as a response to the global trend towards reducing prison costs and prisoner numbers. In May, a group of leading American economists sent the U.S. government a letter urging the reduction of the prison population. In recent years, the United States has become increasingly reliant on the massive privatization of correctional services. From private prisons to private probation offices, the United States has seen companies receive contracts to house, feed, and discipline those who have broken the law. And as private correctional services have flourished, they have grown increasingly involved in what is seen as the core of prison operations—keeping the population of incarcerated prisoners in compliance. This system has come up short when it comes to ensuring that the prisons are both safe and efficient, and has raised serious concerns over who is incarcerated and the quality of their treatment. Private prison companies—most notably the Corrections Corporation of America, the largest GEO group, and the GEO Group, the nation's third largest private prison company—now occupy a growing corner of the American penal justice universe. In 2009, more than half of the United States' 300,000 people behind bars were in private prisons. Today, as the United States faces an even greater surge in the incarceration of nonviolent offenders, it is increasingly necessary for us to figure out more humane and cost-effective ways to deal with this situation.

The University of Arizona has been getting complaints about the sound of its football team's horn, especially during football games. This week, after an Arizona Republic investigation found significant problems with the sound, the university asked that the NCAA change its rules regarding the use of the sound, including restricting its use in a certain stadium. The school did not provide specifics about the complaint made to the university. University officials said the university is considering an appeal.

In a statement on its website, the school said it was investigating how it plays the horn and would provide updates when it knows more. The school said it has notified all the parties involved and the NCAA of its findings, which it will consider by January of 2018, or whenever there is a ruling. "We are working hard to resolve the issues raised in this investigation, and are taking this situation very seriously," the school said. RELATED: College football teams with the most fans, most fans-related arrests It's hard to find much information on how the University of Minnesota, the University of Minnesota Duluth, the University of Minnesota North. The NCAA's rules about how a team chooses to use its horn, set with the intent of creating a competitive environment, also prevent universities from playing with it during non-conference games, though the NCAA allows it in certain circumstances when those games would be competitive. The NCAA is currently in a process to review its rules governing what officials must do to make sure that fan engagement and participation is at the highest possible level, though it has a history of changing its rules, including its handling of college football fans of both teams.	0
Milo Yiannopoulos is no longer at Breitbart. Here's what you need to know. (Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post) In the wake of a video in which he appears to defend pedophilia as well as assault on women, conservative commentator Milo Yiannopoulos resigned from Breitbart News on Tuesday – just 12 days after he was given the website's highest role. The site's CEO, Larry Solov, offered his "sincere condolences" to Yiannopoulos and his family, as did Yiannopoulos's editor in chief, Alexander Marlow, via email. Marlow also provided a copy of his resignation letter, written from overseas. "I am incredibly proud of my role at Breitbart, and the important role it played in defusing the growing hate movement that is currently engulfing our world — and in promoting tolerance and understanding," he wrote. "Breitbart News is also a platform for the alt-right, an emerging conservative movement that has caused concern among some," he wrote. Marlow described Breitbart as his "home for news and commentary for the alt-right." As the Post and other news outlets reported, this "new" conservative movement includes more than just "conservatives" — it also includes "white supremacists, anti-Semites, racists and misogynists." Marlow wrote: "[O]ur coverage was critical in highlighting the growing popularity of the #Gamergate movement that abused and threatened individuals with physical harm for not believing that women and minorities had the same opportunities as men, and for challenging the traditional, gender-based gaming culture; and in identifying many of the core political problems facing our free society." [The disturbing alt-right 'journalism' I helped write] Solov had already announced last week that Yiannopoulos, who has said he's gay, would no longer be working at Breitbart after a video surfaced in which he appeared to condone pedophilia, among other topics. The resignation letter described Solov's decision to put Yiannopoulos in the highest position at Breitbart "after careful consideration" but said that "the article that ran this morning was the final straw." Yiannopoulos's recent comments on child sex have "caused a firestorm within the right-wing media ecosystem," Solov wrote, arguing that the site would need to "be more deliberate and thoughtful in our coverage moving forward." "We must do better, and it begins with improving our coverage, not shying away from controversial but important content," he added. "I'm eager to be part of the team rebuilding trust with this important audience. This is a new era at Breitbart but I'm confident the right people will lead it." [Milo Yiannopoulos resigns from Breitbart as advertiser pulls ads from website following controversial comments] In a press statement to The Post, Yiannopoulos wrote, "I am not a child abuser. I did not say those things. If I thought the argument that I was defending child abuse was persuasive, I would not be standing in front of you today. I am not arguing, nor have I ever argued, that all relationships between an adult and minor are consensual. Pedophilia is not a sexual orientation, it is a type of mental illness." Solov had also said, "Milo is a terrifically talented writer, editor and provocateur, but he cannot lend himself to effective workplace environments, nor does he deserve to. He has exceeded all of our expectations and will be greatly missed by us all." Yiannopoulos, who was born in Greece and raised in London, grew up in the United States before starting a career in media in Britain. He rose to fame under the leadership of his controversial right-wing news site Breitbart after being hired by senior chairman Stephen K. Bannon. Breitbart has faced criticism following Yiannopoulos's departure from its front page. The site published a story earlier this month, reporting that a female Breitbart writer asked for a raise but, according to her contract, it did not pay much.	0
The U.S. Navy's newest amphibious assault ship, USS Iwo Jima (LHA-5), was launched by the commanding officer of the Norfolk Naval Shipyard in Hampton Roads, Va. at 11:00 a.m. on July 11. The USS Iwo Jima (LHA-5) will replace the Iwo Jima, a U.S. Navy amphibious assault ship that suffered a fatal accident in May when a man slipped off an escape slide and fell 40 feet onto the deck of the ship. Since May 10, more than 80 civilian and military personnel have been injured in Iwo Jima as a result of the accident.	0
"The thing is, the guys would do it in the office and we'd all laugh at them," he continued. "I think I have more of a reputation for not being the most dramatic guy in the office, but once I started getting them to start taking themselves more seriously, it was a great thing, and I think it helped them build this bigger picture." In recent months, Trump has taken to publicly chastising his staff for their shortcomings. In mid-April he tweeted that his chief of staff, Reince Priebus, was "weak, ineffective and not able to stand behind the team." He singled out former Chief Strategist Steve Bannon for criticism as well. "I am so upset with Steve Bannon, I thought he was going to be my best friend," he said. "But he's not a good person." After a long press conference on Monday, which went poorly, the president told reporters that he is frustrated with the West Wing staff and that "the buck stops here." "I'm always frustrated sometimes in the White House with the way — it's not that it doesn't work, but it's working really well against us," he said. Trump, whose presidential campaign was defined by his campaign-trail brashness, has long been regarded as an outlier. But the president has also consistently proven a reluctant or reluctant-to-be-apologetic president. "He is not particularly concerned about how he's perceived," said former Republican strategist Kevin Madden, who's worked on four Republican administrations. "It's just the person he is." The president is far from alone on the GOP front in refusing to take criticism. Some Republicans have been known to be loath to apologize when they've made questionable decisions, particularly in private. Others have been particularly sensitive to any suggestion that they're willing to bend on conservative or national security policies, or that they've given up a fight over conservative values. There's a long history here, but during the presidential primaries, Trump used his position as a celebrity to offer a kind of reality TV reality show—a reality of himself, on television. He didn't shy away from the tough questions and the negative comments, the same way a typical political candidate would. He didn't shy away from his controversial rhetoric. And he didn't make a big deal of the fact that he was a reality star as a political candidate. "The reality TV star is the new reality," said Roger Stone, a longtime Trump adviser, later. Trump in February began appearing on "Meet the Press" with Chuck Todd, a longtime NBC-talk-show host who he has long attacked as inaccurate and biased because of his liberal leanings.	0
MILAN – The latest news and views from Real Madrid as we prepare to meet Cristiano Ronaldo at the Superclásico clash against Barcelona at 1am this Sunday. The Portuguese has been talking in the media about what will happen during the Superclásico. "This season I'll be happy if we win, otherwise I'll be disappointed because I'll be away from home. We will have to battle for a victory as I have to spend the night away from my family." After scoring 29 goals last season, the 30-year-old hopes to score even more. "Maybe 40 goals, but I haven't begun yet. I'm really happy to have hit 30 and we'll be happy to win if we can break that record," "It's one thing to be a goal-scorer, it's something I've been working on. In Spain, football is a team sport, you have to bring the whole team with you, to take them where you need to go. You can score goals, score assists, but you cannot do it alone," he said Cristiano's new agent, Jorge Mendes, will not be attending any of the games this weekend. "Jorge is really happy with the work we've done for him. I think that with his experience he can help his client at every stage." The Madrid coach, Carlo Ancelotti, is confident of being able to exploit Cristiano's excellent play at the Clásico. "When we won the Champions League against Atlético Madrid, he made two assists and was very effective. We are very pleased he's coming to Madrid for this game," "Cristiano loves competition and has the right attitude to play at his highest. He's an important player for us, and I hope his goals will be in the goals against Barcelona," said Ancelotti at the post-match press conference. Barca star Neymar also wants to help his club defeat Real Madrid. "I'm just thinking of helping the team in any way I can, that's it," he told The Sun. "Of course, I'm very happy to win the Superclásico, even though this is my first time in Madrid. My goal was to get to the finals of the Champions League," "Barca must win, I'm not going to give them any sympathy", a very calm and confident Neymar explained. "I think there will be more points at Madrid, because if they win at all in this league, then it will show they can win in the Champions League as well. If we win the Superclásico, we can start talking about that in April," Neymar said.	0
New Zealand Rugby officials are confident they can get the All Blacks into next year's Rugby World Cup, having just beaten off an early challenge from France and Japan. A series of tests in France and Japan has led to questions from the French as to whether New Zealand cannot take a team to the tournament in Japan. The New Zealand Rugby Union has taken every measure it can to reassure French rugby officials they are fit and ready for the World Cup, a process which reached an emphatic conclusion on Saturday evening. After defeating Japan 36-20 in a pre-quarter-final warm-up, the All Blacks completed a record-equalling 13th consecutive Test series win against a New Zealand opponent with victory in Paris on Sunday. New Zealand Rugby President Steve Tew described it as a "good win" for the tournament's integrity and "the best victory of the year".	0
In an attempt to improve his image, President Obama said Thursday that he regrets talking about the racial profiling by the Los Angeles Police Department that resulted in the killing of an unarmed black man in 2008, but did not give a reason for his refusal to apologize for it. Speaking to the Rev. Al Sharpton at the National Action Network in Washington, where Obama was expected to discuss health care policy and immigration, he blamed Americans who "seem to only care when other people are in trouble and we don't pay attention to our own problems in our own communities." He added: "I am not going to be part of a political 'gotcha' moment where we're just going to attack one another and start bringing race into our political process. I care not one whit about politics that trivialize the African-American experience or otherwise suggest that African-Americans are somehow less American because of the color of their skin." The remarks, which came before he had started speaking, sparked outrage from Republicans and civil rights activists. "A Black Lives Matter member said Obama is 'not going to be a part of a political 'gotcha' moment where we're just going to attack one another and start bringing race into our political process.' —Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa), quoted here," Rep. James Clyburn (D-S.C.) tweeted. "Why would President Obama agree to come here and pretend he cares about race relations after just saying it was 'nonsense'?" Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.) quipped in a tweet. "I don't know to whose political gain these comments are being made," Lewis said in a tweet earlier this week. "The President and his administration may have had a positive influence on relations between the white and black citizens in this country, but I have always believed there is no reason for him to apologize for his own mistakes." Obama said in the speech that he wished it was possible for him to "find a way to say 'I'm sorry' without taking it personally. That's why sometimes it's hard for us to hear each other. It is something that we all feel, and there's no excuse. And that's the way it always should be." Obama said he had never before "been asked what I could do to make everybody feel better," but hoped that his comments would contribute to a "healing moment" in our society. "We are a better America because of Martin Luther King Jr.," he said, referring to the founder of the civil rights movement. "He has inspired millions of people because of his courage and his hope." On June 3, 2008, while riding his bicycle through Los Angeles, 28-year-old Ernesto Diaz was fatally shot by two officers of the Los Angeles Police Department. The shooting happened after police stopped the man as he allegedly drove erratically through a Hollywood neighborhood. When he refused to get out of the car, and police attempted to tasers him, he was shot as he tried to get back into the car. He subsequently died three days later at a hospital. Despite a $8 million settlement on Diaz's behalf, the case was only recently settled. During a press conference with Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti and Police Chief Charlie Beck later in the day, Obama said: "I can only imagine what people are feeling today around the country as they wonder how we can address race relations and trust between the communities and the police department that they elected us to serve." Rep. Emanuel Cleaver (D-Mo.) asked, "Would that be so hard to say? What would be your response?" Obama replied, "Well, I'm not going to say it." The president later added: "It's easy to forget that for a lot of people it was a shocking, shocking incident and we're not going to pretend that that was any different." Obama's comments came five days after Eric Holder, the attorney general whose department found that the LAPD had violated civil rights by shooting Diaz, told a congressional panel that the DOJ was reviewing the case. Holder told members of the House Judiciary Committee: "We have received and turned over a whole bunch of information that we're reviewing, and we've asked for public comment as to what else we should look into."	0
It is not clear if Mr Modi will bring in a law requiring the construction of toilets in India's public places, amid concerns it wouldn't be possible to enforce such an order due to security problems. "In the case of public toilets it is very difficult for any officer to make an arrest," said an official, who didn't wish to be named. A senior official from the ministry of women and child development told the AFP news agency that while the country isn't quite where it would like to be when it comes to gender equality, "we recognise the fact and work on it". The comments came after Mr Modi called for the setting up of "gender-separated toilets" at a rally in the western state of Rajasthan where the prime minister is touring in his first overseas visit since taking office in 2014. The BJP general secretary in Gujarat when Mr Modi last came to the state said that Mr Modi's call was "absolutely incorrect" and that women in India did not need separate toilets. "We've not even thought about it and never planned it," Sushil Joshi said in a speech before India's parliament in 2012. "If we build separate toilets where will there be any problem for women?" "We are going to make toilets for women which would not have separate toilets," Mr Modi said in an interview with CNN-IBN this week. The comments are likely to be criticised in the social media, where calls are already being made for the prime minister to apologise and explain why he did not follow through on his original promise. The government's website notes that the Indian government "has taken a number of measures to improve the situation in terms of availability of toilet facilities for women and children". However, the website does not reference the recent ban on the sale of cattle for slaughter and the increasing number of women's violence campaigns. A recent study by the Women's Resource and Empowerment Foundation found that there were around 4.7 million unplanned childbirths per year in the country. Of those, the highest number of pre-term births were to women under 15 years old, women who were married at some point and women from low-caste or tribal communities. At least 2,000 children among India's girls will die as a result of being born outside of marriage each year, according to the report.	0
A former member of the British intelligence officer's family said they are "devastated that any family member would ever want to involve themselves with" the "dishonest people" who worked for British intelligence. Former member of the British intelligence officer's family said they are "devastated that any family member would ever want to involve themselves, themselves or their own children" with "dishonest people." (Al Jazeera America) This is perhaps an understatement. The former member of the British intelligence officer's family said this week that if he had known the people he worked with, he would have never hired them. In an interview on the "Anderson Cooper 360° Show" with Anderson Cooper that aired Tuesday, the family member said he was "appalled" to learn that his sister-in-law did business with a British intelligence officer, who he said had an "extreme political bias." "I actually feel terrible," he said. After the interview, the former member of the family also told the BBC that he is "extremely disturbed" about what he learned. He was referring to his sister-in-law. The former member of the intelligence officer's family said his family learned about the operation after news organizations reported on the operation. He also revealed that his mother was also involved with the former intelligence officer. In a subsequent interview with the Washington Examiner, the family member said he didn't tell his sister-in-law about the case until after her company was sold. "We're devastated. What has that done to her?" he said. "I'm absolutely devastated for her. I never would have thought that this would have happened but what can you do?" It's an extreme example of an ongoing problem in intelligence circles, where "proactive measures" against political opponents, especially immigrants, are common. Formerly employed by U.S. intelligence agencies, the former member of the family said he had nothing to gain from working for British intelligence. He said he has always been honest about his activities and always paid his own expenses, including airfare. But when he started looking for a company in the U.K., the British intelligence agency came up with him. After that, other people found out about him because he showed them his CV, it was published in a national news outlet, the British national security website ExCere. But it seems the former member was unaware that the information on the former agent's CV went over the spy agency's radar. "My mum was very disappointed that I did this and said that I never should have done this," he told the Examiner. "I didn't do this for me, I did it for the country." It is unclear if the British government has investigated or sanctioned the woman who used to work for the spy agency. But the agency told the BBC that the intelligence officer "had fully abided by the rules of the office of intelligence and security of the United Kingdom," and has "no known personal grievance against the agency or its staff."	0
I am a Christian and I am proud to be a Christian. I've always felt comfortable and at home with this faith. And even at a young age I was able to see how this religion's values and teachings provided an answer to my questions and concerns in a way I could relate to. For a time, I also felt a certain comfort and belonging and certainty in my beliefs that I could never experience without the Bible. I found comfort in it. I connected to it. It was my comfort. And it provided a sense of clarity and purpose and understanding and peace and comfort and meaning and meaninglessness. Over time as I have grown in understanding, I have come to regret the path my youth took. I've come to understand the deep and serious problems facing our society today. And I've come to understand that the only hope for a better America lies not in the idea that God is on my side, but in the idea that we are on his side. That we are all God's children, part of one human family. The only hope to move ahead is to work together to change our institutions. To create something better here on Earth. And I've come to understand that we may very well have our most glorious and glorious days ahead. I've come to know that America's strength comes from its diversity. Our strength comes from our people's passion for inclusion. Our strength comes from those who love their country but not for who they are—those who want to keep us divided. Our strength comes from those who see America as a land shaped by the power of hope over fear. Our strength comes from the promise of a future where we will be judged by our contentment not by the color of our skin, not by the wealth of our background, not by the zip of our religion or our sexual orientation. We have never lived in a nation where all of us have felt fully and equally at home, but the world is changing. I believe that in the future this hope will be put to good use. I believe that with the right leadership we will make America stronger. I believe America is great and can be great again. I believe that we can and will become stronger and more united and more prosperous, and more peaceful and kind and generous and kind than we have ever been. I have been encouraged to see the great work being done by our faith, that in fact we have no more urgent task because America has moved forward—we have moved forward in every area we set our mind to. For the last couple of years in particular, I have been so profoundly moved by the extraordinary change that has transformed our nation: the change of values; the change of attitudes; the change at our core of a faith that is stronger than ever; the transformation in our cities of the young people who have come forward to bring the changes that we deserve. I have seen these changes. And I believe in the power of this work for the good of our country and for the good of the world. The work we are doing is good work. But we are not done yet. We have much more work to do. One of the most significant changes we have seen in this nation, and for the world, in recent years is the loss of faith in the basic values that have made our country such a success. So much has been built on the trust that was placed in our institutions for us all to be equal before the law and have basic rights regardless of race, nationality, or faith. I believe as I do from my own experience that such a culture is fragile and needs to be nurtured and protected. But we still have a long way to go. It is our belief that this kind of work can be accomplished only if we believe in our God and God's goodness. That's what has sustained us and helped us overcome many of our challenges—faith, faith, faith. So it is my prayer tonight that all of us will rededicate ourselves to the idea of a God who is good, and believe in his goodness and hope for the future and in those whom we trust to be our leaders with clear eyes and steady hearts and boundless faith. This is the work of the future. We are called by God to make the world a better place and the work of our generation will prove that. So tonight I would like to speak to you about that work; in particular about the vital power of faith to transform hearts and make our world better, but I will give you an invitation; it is not open to you. What I would like to convey—the power and the responsibility—are the truths of God's word. These words I am going to speak to you about today are not things I believe. I am not trying to convince you with my intellect, my intelligence, with anything I've learned from your faith traditions. No, these truths come from God. They come in the Bible. They come from the traditions of the people who believe these things. And so I	0
Gorgeous New Photos from 'X-Men: Days of Future Past' Poster Reveal Wolverine's Glamorous Transformation First things first, X-Men: Days of Future Past is awesome . Really. I'm not sure how I managed to put it off so long while desperately craving this particular installment of the mutant superhero saga. With its stunning visuals and thrilling action, director Bryan Singer's reboot (which stars Nicholas Hoult, Michael Fassbender, and Anna Paquin) has me more excited than any X-Men movie in history. But let there be no doubt: it's a superhero movie, and it's set in the X-Men timeline. A little knowledge of the universe and a great movie can go a long way.  Now that 'Days of Future Past' has been released in the United States, we've gotten our hands on a new poster on the official 'X-Men: Days of Future Past' Facebook page. (It's actually a slightly different poster than the one below, because someone was going to be using the original in a different context) And while I love the new look, the poster is also a bit confusing, and a little hard to read. That's where these beautiful new photos come in.  In the series of pictures, director Simon Kinberg's team uses the following three photos to tell the story of Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart), Magneto (James McAvoy), and the other mutants who live in the future on Earth. We see the other iconic X-Men, from Iceman (Michael Fassbender), Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence), Blink (Kamryn Douglas), and Beast (Nicholas Hoult), as well as Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), Quicksilver (Aaron Taylor-Johnson), and Cyclops (James McAvoy). The group fights the Sentinels, which seem to be powered by the Sentinels' creators.  After seeing these photos — and some of my own — I wonder if Scott Summers (James McAvoy) could be the one behind all the evil. I'm not saying he can't be, but I'm saying this would be a major turn in his personal life, and I'm not sure how that could play out in the long run. He's just a teenager in a world of mutants … could it ever be easy for him to get it all back?  X-Men: Days of Future Past opens on Blu-ray and DVD March 15th, 2014.

An estimated 1.5 million Syrians have fled their country since the fighting began more than two years ago, making it the overwhelming majority of the population who have left Iraq over that period. Some 3 percent of the population over Iraq fled, according to a study from Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and the International Rescue Committee. The conflict began as peaceful demonstrations against the regime, but quickly degenerated. The violence, particularly around the city of Aleppo over the summer, was intense but sporadic. The violence in the past year has not seen the intensity of the summer's massacres, in which hundreds of Syrians became the victims of attacks in separate cities. But even if many Syrian government forces are being killed by the insurgents, other soldiers are being killed by the rebels, who have gained a foothold in some parts of the country from which to launch attacks. The surge of refugees is a significant blow to the war-torn country because Syria is already a source of one of the world's most extensive refugee flows, and many thousands remain trapped. More than 1.3 million Syrian refugees, including more than 600,000 children, live outside the country, according to the United Nations. Although the violence is intensifying in rebel-held eastern Aleppo and the Syrian government now appears to have lost control of much of the country, the government still controls a majority of the population centers and holds only about 50 percent of the land. "We are talking about a country that is becoming ever more fragmented," Mr. Lakhdar and Ms. Khatib said.	0
As I said in my most recent post on these topics here's the latest in my weekly series about the "sociological illiteracy" in American culture, and in the media! You'd be surprised at how often I get emails from atheists, and even theists, about "god's reasons for existence" and theism at this point. I think they are mostly correct if not in all of their points. But then again, I think most atheists and agnostics in America know enough about theology to have a pretty firm grasp of the Bible, and are also quite familiar with some of the Christian doctrines. So let me take a look at one particular case, and try to help atheists think about Christianity in a rational and critical manner. Here's a story I heard recently. A man was out jogging. Some thugs tried to get him to sell drugs. He refused and got into a street fight. Later that day, a group of Christians were waiting for him in the parking lot. One came up and asked him about his experience, why some "sinners" were being tortured and destroyed. "What sin did those people commit that the Lord hates?" That may sound like the typical Christian response to the question. But if an atheist is asking an equally reasonable question, we will get a very different response. Why would you ask such a question? First, I don't think the Christian's answer is really what you expect. As I said back when we had the case of the church lady who wrote to my last post, it's a very Christian response that is really about showing contempt for the other. And they don't call her a demon-possessed fraud, they call her a blaspheming slut. That's a bit different from saying, "Well, all of the sins and blasphemies in the world are sins against the Lord, so this man has earned it, and we are only following the teachings of Jesus." There's also nothing rational about it, and the "sin against" is in the second clause. The problem with this approach is that your "sin" is not the sin you commit. It's the sin you accuse the other person of. What's going on? Why say a woman who has a sinful husband is making it up?" I think there's three reasons for that. First, they are defending their own honor. They are not willing to admit that their God is not all-powerful. Not really. Second, they hope that by getting you to admit the sin is a big deal, that they will be seen as having done their job. Third, they hope that we will see that they are right and that the way they're defending the honor of their "family" is just as good as any other defense. Now this kind of argument from silence is really a straw man. The fact that they think that any claim is a valid defense of their authority and honor is not proof that they are right, or at least that they are right when they assert they are right. Even though such a claim must be "valid", it does not establish its truth, that is a different thing. As far as I can tell the Christian is arguing by pretending that all claim that God must have had some supernatural explanation for all of these events happening, the one we know of in the Bible (God's being awesome), and that if someone doesn't believe this to be so, then all of the other evidence they have is invalid. This is a classic appeal to ignorance. For any person who thinks this way, the argument is just not worth making. Now in this case, we also have the problem with the "slavery excuse". The truth is, this only works if they know that slaves were being tortured and kept as property. And the reason a person would not know that unless he personally was in a prison or being tortured is not because they lack information. This is because people often fail to realize that the person they talk to is not talking to an impartial observer. They are talking to someone they believe to be their friend or family. As far as the argument's based on God's justice, it works well for the believer who has no knowledge of the true history of slavery. For the skeptic, however, as I mentioned in previous posts, we have to remember those who lived in those times. They probably suffered just as you do, and some probably died more violently and horrible deaths. Anyway, those are the three reasons.

DETROIT - A 20-year-old is at the bottom of the Grand River near the Southfield Marina. Now, more than four months ago, he drowned during a swim he was trying to do. Heather B. Smith told Local 4 he decided to go in the water. "He said he was feeling really bad," Smith said. Smith said her son, Jason Smith, drowned trying to do a sprint. "He kept swimming and swam," she added. "He was coming down the stream and then he started going down the wall, and he tried to jump off. "A woman yelled out for him to get in the shallow end, or the bottom. He ran into the water, and didn't want to swim, and he turned around and started coming up the wall. And then he went under water," Smith said. The Grand River is home to many rapids, such as the Southbound Falls, which was recently reopened after extensive repairs. They're designed to help people in the river, but some people, they said, go over the top, and swim around the rapids. The Grand River is not supposed to keep people in the river with them. "I don't want to be the person who says 'You shouldn't be on the river during a flash flood because you're going to drown,'" Smith said. It's that same concern that led Smith's family to put up signs saying no swimming to help them raise money for the Friends of Grand River Reservation. "People jump in. They don't realize it's not the safest way to go," Smith said. "It's hard. He was really a young man, so it's hard to come to terms with." Jason Smith was the only son she had. When Smith wasn't at home, she said she would get the kids ready and then go out to her car. He was one, and she didn't want any of them to miss him. "He was a good person, a good son," Smith said. "He was a good guy." Copyright 2013 by ClickOnDetroit.com. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.	0
A young man was killed when an alleged gang member opened fire on a patrol car in northwest Harris County this morning. Police don't believe the officer's family knew the deceased. He was shot at about 5:25 a.m. in the area of West Houston and Montrose.According to a Harris County Sheriff's Press Release, the officer was with a partner investigating the theft of a vehicle when "at least two men began acting suspicious toward the suspects and the officer." Police allege the suspects "observed them driving an older model white sedan. One of the suspects got out of the vehicle with a handgun concealed in his waistband as one of the officers opened fire at the suspects' vehicle. During the gunfire, the officer was struck in the head. The suspect then exited his vehicle and ran back into the group."The deceased was identified as 18-year-old Johnhorne Fennell of Spring.He has been sent to the Harris County Institute of Forensic Sciences. The deceased is the third Houston deputy shot to death by an individual in just more than a week.	0
The idea of paying your child to play videogames is a relatively new one. With the rise of cell phones and social media it seems that the idea of letting children as young as five-years-old play video games has become more acceptable. But as long as they don't hurt themselves or people around them, why shouldn't a child's free time be spent playing video games? "It is up to parents, however, to be vigilant about the games they allow their children to play, so no one ends up with a black eye or a broken arm simply because a child chose to play a certain videogame to which it was not authorized by their parent," noted a report by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP). Some parents do allow their children to play videogames, but parents are sometimes reluctant to let their children play violent or sexual games. As the AAP notes, there are a few cases where video game violence may be OK, such as when parents believe that they can protect their children by limiting their exposure to violent games. But even games that are considered to be of "low" to "moderate" violence are often violent in style: for example, with the game Splosion Man: "These games have no blood or gore, and no sexual content. But they do involve killing virtual monsters that use weapons, often in gruesome ways, as depicted in the title," notes the report. Other games are much more sexually explicit than in the previous example. Some of the most popular sexual games that your children can play, according to the AAP report, are: Sleeping Dogs: "Sleeping Dogs is a violent stealth game featuring criminals and gangsters who try to take over Hong Kong. In these games, the player can shoot or stab as many people as possible and take out guns from their bodies to shoot others, but they also need to take out their rivals' weapons in order to take down the leader," states the report. Resident Evil: Umbrella Corps: "In Resident Evil: Umbrella Corps, a group of "Umbrella agents" are on the run from Umbrella Corporation when a deadly virus is released. Players can assume the identity of either a member of a secret government task force or a rogue agent in the fictional setting of the film and make decisions that result in either saving the world or saving a loved one's life. In this game the player can choose to save one character or the entire group of agents. This game is violent and may contain violence or other elements of a mature nature." Tom Clancy's The Division: "Tom Clancy's The Division, a third-person shooter video game, allows gamers to participate in "siege gameplay" as a terrorist group called The Division, led by an "E3-trained" former U.S. Secret Service agent, battles rival terrorist groups. This game emphasizes tactical maneuvering over traditional shooting. Unlike most "siege games" in which both teams fight using traditional assault rifles, The Division also includes military-grade weapons. Players can choose to be either of two factions, using one of the two factions' weapons, such as assault rifles and handguns." These games may seem more "fun" than violence, but is the game still violent? According to the AAP report, video games are one of the safest games for your children to play, simply because it is so non-violent and no actual harm is done to other people. Video games are not like traditional video games with guns and explosions. It is only when videogames are played with violence, or in some instances sexual content, that there is a potential for danger. "There is no real harm in playing video games in moderate amounts, or just because a parent or teacher thinks the child might enjoy a certain game. A video game isn't the same as playing real-life sports or playing with toys," said the report. A game with a non-violent story and just good gameplay is actually a much safer game than one with more violence and sexual content, according to the AAP. It is important for parents to know when it is appropriate for their children to play. There are games out there, like Tom Clancy's The Division, that do require parental supervision and supervision is strongly recommended for young children who are playing these kinds of games.	0

From the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, and the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute (STRI), Panama: Two new species of spider named in honor of former U.S. Presidents George W. Bush and Bill Clinton have been described from two sites of the Panamanian Rainforest. The specimens are the seventh and eighth new species of tropical spiders since 2010, a period of significant growth in the species' range. The researchers described the pair as Hogna tepidariorum and Hogna mafra, both from the genus Hogna. The two are restricted to a tropical lowland region in the southwestern portion of the Panama Canal region. The spiders are distinguished from other species by their different colored "tongue" hairs. The spider species, each between 6 mm and 9 mm in length and weighing less than 30 grams, are described in the online edition of Zookeys this week. Hogna tepidariorum (n. gen., n. adj.) is a larger, more robust relative of Hogna tepidariorum subsp. tepidariorum. It is only found in areas where the rainforest has been converted to agriculture or where humans have disturbed the forest's habitat (e.g., with clearing or clearing of natural forest) or introduced invasive species (e.g., the American chestnut tree virus). In Central America, the two places where these spiders have been found are the Guajira River watershed as well as the Costa Rican Amazon, the first time Hogna tepidariorum subsp. tepidariorum has been described in these two areas. The researchers named a second new species of Hogna spider, Hogna mafra, in honor of former U.S. President Bill Clinton. The new species is based upon the specimen collected by Patricia H. Stoeckle and Paul R. A. Zuber of the University of Texas, Austin and described at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City. The specimen is from Ecuador. The name Hogna mafra has Spanish origins. Since 1998, the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute (STRI) has been working as part of the USGS's Panama-Caribbean Tropical Forest Program to support the biological collection of tropical biodiversity from the rainforest in the Guajira River watersheds of Costa Rica, Colombia, Panama, Ecuador, and Costa Rica. STRI has established a permanent field station at the Boca Negra Nature Reserve within the Guajira Basin, a former salt pan ecosystem that has been disturbed and reforested for agriculture. STRI researchers are using an innovative DNA microsatellite assay to determine the number of genetic lineages (or subpopulations) of tropical species in tropical rainforests worldwide. STRI also collects and catalogs specimens from the Panama-Caribbean Tropical Forest Program. The researchers report that the Boca Negra nature reserve is a refuge for species such as Hogna mafra.	0
I'm a big fan of the Kanger Protank 2, and I've even upgraded my old Protank with the TC100, because it's compact, easy to switch between the tanks in a drop-in fashion, and the flavor output just blows me away. I purchased the Kanger Protank 4 on a whim, because I've seen it touted as being slightly better than the other two tanks in the family, and that's exactly what it is. With that said, I figured that the new Protank 4 is definitely a much nicer tank to look at and to hold. It's more comfortable to hold and it doesn't feel like you're squeezing the sides and top of the tank together. The tank also holds up surprisingly well. I haven't had an issue with leaks, while still allowing you to adjust your resistance, and I've also found that it can perform really great at low wattage and then hold up quite well. The Kanger Protank 4 takes the classic Kanger drip tip of the Protank 2, along with a new one from Kanger, the Kanger Aerotank. The new Aerotank doesn't fit perfectly in the old Protank 2 drip tip, as it's wider and longer than the other Protank tip, but now that it has a better drip tip, I'm not even worried about it. As you can see from the pictures, I've also got two tank caps on the Protank 4! I can't even tell that they aren't there! They're great! I've decided to go with a dual coil setup, which is currently my go-to tank setup for this size of tank. It performs amazing, and has so many different flavors to choose from. I really love the Protank 4. Highly recommended! 2 people found this helpful	0
Greetings all. This is a topic that has come up so often, in my work at TDC (and for others) that it seems to have morphed into an article. This is a personal blog post, and I realize that may upset people that I've spoken at or have spoken at other schools. To be completely fair to people who do disagree with me, I'm not trying to "bully" anyone into action (or away from action). I am simply trying to state for the record the opinion of my former employer. I appreciate the opportunity to do so, as do you, as I want to leave this topic as one that is in an open, and hopefully constructive, discussion. It took me awhile, some very dark night nights of the soul, but I reached a point where I had to take a position on the elephant in the room (and in my own mind). It is this view that I will go on to describe below, my views and motivations, and, most importantly, my reasons for thinking it is OK for a teacher or teacher parent to get involved in an organization that is openly anti-union…or to support a union. This is not a question, just an opinion. And it is not a position I believe is common among most "professional educator" organizations today. So let me explain. In my experience as a teacher, I can tell you, that the majority of teachers are union members, especially in the most progressive areas. They make union a top priority, whether they support the union, or not. And I'm not talking about teachers who simply vote for a union (although this is the most common way). I'm talking a "strong" union supporter who will actively support a union, whether they agree or not. I don't believe that a teacher who has always supported a union has committed any form of professional misconduct. It is not a crime to oppose a union. On the contrary, it is a form of professional commitment to serve your country to support our fellow citizens, regardless if you personally agree with the union on all issues. And a teacher that is against a union? What I do believe is that being against unions, or at least being on the fence about union, is no longer a valid excuse for getting "paid" to lie. It is a badge of honor just like "being a teacher" is in today's teacher marketplace. And, I'm telling you this as an educator! Many people in my profession are not educators, just like some in the "professional" industry. And just because the name "educator" is associated with a school (which is not an ideal position) in our nation, it does not mean we don't need to practice what we preach for the children. We do need to teach children from a basic set of values. In fact, it is our responsibility to pass those same values on to our children, to their friends, and to our fellow citizens. And, if a union-free education is what is "right" for the children, then by all means the union-free education is what is right for those children. I'm not a parent, or anyone who wants to dictate what is right for my children (and that includes you, as an employer, as well). So, if you have the opportunity for an employer who will sponsor a teacher who supports a union, do so. If the position is part-time or "on the side," give those who have the right to support to teachers a "special time of pay" or some other way to express what their "part-time relationship" means. But do not pay a union supporter to advocate for the union in any way that will impact your bottom line! (And yes, I am aware you want to stay "in the game", and have to pay some dues, even if that is against your conscience.) Keep in mind, though, that what you give is how much you will ultimately receive back in the form of your job. And if you are a teacher, parent, or organization that has an issue with TDC having an issue with it's union-supporters, we're always happy to help you understand that an organization is not always a "one-sided" organization. If it is truly an exclusive club with members solely due to the issue of their unions support, we would all welcome a conversation with that organization concerning the merits of opposing unions. But if it is not about unions, and if you know for a fact that this organization has a policy that opposes unions, and your position is aligned to mine, this might not be the place to find other organizations that will support you and your position. We offer services to many organizations on a regular basis. And if you find other organizations with similar views and policies to those of TDC, please let us know. We are always willing to discuss these issues. And again, I reiterate, please do not attack other	0
KOLKATA: For the first time, an Indian school textbook is being used in the U.S. for teaching mathematics. As part of the Global Mathematics Project (GMP) conducted by the Council on the Accreditation of Educator Preparation (COAP), the American Council for Education (ACE), P.K. Singh, a mathematics teacher from the Delhi Central School, taught in the U.S. to prepare Indian students for the GMP. While at the US for this project along with his students, Mr. Singh introduced a set of mathematical methods which are not normally used in U.S. schools.Mr. Singh, who is also the founder and president of Vigyan Bhartiya Sanskriti Anusandhan Kendra, shared his experiences of teaching mathematics in the US during a workshop at the New York Math Club on Friday. He told TOI: "I have been teaching math for more than 30-years in schools in Punjab where I have been able to show how mathematics is used in India. In addition, I know how to teach it in U.S. too. When I came to the U.S. at the end of 2012, I have learnt several basic principles which are not usually taught in U.S. schools. I wanted to share my experience of teaching math in the U.S to students and the general public here as part of the Global Mathematics Project.The American Council for Education and ACE agreed to work together to produce this textbook in cooperation with Vigyan Bhartiya Sanskriti Anusandhan Kendra, an education organization based in the U.S."Our experience on GMP has provided us with some insights and suggestions. Some of the most important things we learnt are that teachers in the U.S. and India must cooperate. Teachers in one country must have teachers in the other country to train each other. In addition, there must be a clear line of communication – from the teacher to the student. Also, teacher's books and materials must be in U.S. dollars. We also talked about the need to develop new research, and how India can continue to expand its education sector."The new Indian textbook has been approved by the ACE and has been sent to Vigyan Bhartiya Sanskriti Anusandhan Kendra for development."I am quite excited that this textbook has been approved by ACE and has been sent to Vigyan Bhartiya Sanskriti Anusandhan Kendra for development and the final version of it is due early next year. They have worked on this from the beginning. It is going to be a great collaboration for India and the U.S.," said Mr. Singh.The U.S. version of the textbook will be published by The Council on the Accreditation of Educator Preparation (COAP). "The content of this textbook will also be used in Indian schools, through teacher education programs and as a teaching tool in the academic discipline of mathematics," said Mr. Singh.The textbook will be available to teachers on various websites of Vigyan Bhartiya Sanskriti Anusandhan Kendra and the Council on the Accreditation of Educator Preparation along with some other education organizations. There are also some publications by the organization that will make this textbook available to students in the U.S. "A small portion of the textbook has been translated and we have sent that to the Indian version. I am not certain if that's going to be included as part of the final release of the book, but that is my hope," said Mr. Singh.The book is being adapted to U.S. English language. "It is based on the Indian Mathematics in English version and some other Indian textbooks as well. The basic mathematics and some interesting questions from the textbook will be translated into English," said Mr. Singh.	0
This is one of those "I read it for the story" moments. In the mid 1980s, a small group of people were looking at the same problem and came up with the same solution and a few other things that, if you were a scientist with a small budget and a large idea, would be very interesting for a good story. The problem comes from a very basic question about whether there is a connection between the rate of change of the weather and atmospheric carbon dioxide. Here is the paper for some background: Kotov , J. D-M. et al. (1986) Does the Atmospheric Climate Model Run on a Computer Get More True than False Temperatures? Atmospheric Science Letters, 10(3), 585-589. Basically, the model runs were set at 2-3% (or less) and it found, in their words, it was "no better than chance". They had one other interesting fact to add: the actual atmospheric CO2 content didn't respond at all to their choice of model, except for the fact that it went up around the equator (see here for more). Their paper was published in Air Science and Technology: A Quarterly Review, no. 1 and their data set they used comes from the US. In this paper, Kotov looked at how different models varied with variations in atmospheric carbon dioxide content. The problem, in this case, was how to handle the fact that climate is actually a global system (not just local) so there can be no simple linear trend in the variation of either CO2 or climate. The models could simulate the whole system and so it's hard to know what is likely to be happening to CO2. For the global climate, the models that did best were ones which could capture the whole world, i.e. in this case the global climate response. The other models could only model part of the world, in this case the North American and Australian regions (Figure 1A), but even then they didn't do quite as well. Figure 1. The average simulated climate response of the seven models investigated by Kotov in his paper, (A) Northern Hemisphere and (B) Southern Hemisphere, (from Kotov, 1986). They did get a number of interesting results, notably that the North American continent, although there was less variation in the response, had a larger trend due to the lack of data. The South was a bit more variable and the southern parts of the Antarctic got a bit more sensitive. They weren't so pleased about that, though and pointed this out, saying: We believe that the lack of global trend for the continental portion of the climate system indicates that it has not yet been accurately modeled; that the sensitivity of the global climate to the global carbon dioxide content is unknown; and that the variability of the response of these regions may have to be further explored. The paper was published in the prestigious journal Atmospheric Science Letters. If you think about it, this isn't an entirely new problem. After all, they ran the models a few percent higher for a little while and found that the climate actually got warmer. Why is that important? Well, consider that the Earth's average temperature is about 16.5°C; an increase of 1°C causes that temperature to rise by about 2.2°C. It's the difference between that and the 0.6°C observed in recent times. That is almost the same as half a degree. A change of 2.2°C, let alone half a degree, would make the average temperature in Europe warmer than it is now. So, the models that Kotov looked at simulated the rise of CO2 and they got it to go up, in real life, but with the model that got it to increase most quickly, it went up very slowly and with a lag of weeks or months. That's a bit of a head scratcher, though, isn't it? In fact, to the best of my knowledge, no one before Kotov had even tried to get an idea of whether there was a problem with the trend in climate, whether or not the observed increase was more than just noise in the data. It's hard to believe that no one else had tried before him. Even if it wasn't possible to run large numbers of climate simulations, one way of testing whether there was a problem would be to run one with a large enough variation, say in the range of 20 to 90% of the global range of temperatures, such that all of global climate would change, but that would still show a global increase in temperature if the variations were large. There isn't a lot of data for this, but I'm certain, by the way, that other scientists have tried a variation on this scale, i.e. have done a simulation using a much larger range of variation for climate than just the one which Kotov looked at. So there are some hints	0
How does it feel to be a man? The latest research on men's feelings about masculinity suggests it's a surprisingly nuanced question. And a recent survey of 4,068 men and women ages 26 to 65 reveals that most men and women agree that being a man is important in their lives. But when it comes to the ways in which they identify with the male gender, researchers found no obvious gender divide. According to the poll, men said they thought of themselves as "firm and reliable," "strong and confident," and "assertive," while women said they identified more with the words "caring" and "compassionate." Men also reported having more positive feelings about their bodies than women, with a majority saying they are "very thin" or "very muscular." They were also significantly more likely to be enthusiastic about their bodies in general, and to be averse to comments about appearance and weight. The study was published in the journal Man and Woman in the Social Environment, based on data collected as part of the ongoing International Women's Survey of Men and Masculinities. In recent years, the U.S. has taken on a national focus on the gender issues facing men, and many researchers have noted that men's feelings about their gender have been understudied or ignored. "Most people assume that the two genders are different, yet men and women report very similar beliefs about their gender roles, their values, and their self-perceptions," say a joint statement from the study's researchers. "This research demonstrates that both men and women share similar notions of their masculinity, but with women's perceptions of their masculinity showing less variance." According to the researchers, this is the first study to assess what men think about themselves in relation to masculinity and other attitudes about men. "We have the data that we needed to begin to understand these things, and that is what's so fascinating. Most people assume that the two genders are different, yet men and women report very similar beliefs about their gender roles, their values, and their self-perceptions, which is what's so fascinating," says sociologist and co-author of the study J.P. Rushton, a professor at Louisiana State University. Rushton and his co-authors also hope the survey, which polled 4,068 men and women in three countries, will add context to existing research on how American society and politics have become more equitable, and more progressive, for women. "We're starting to hear voices of men now in conversations about women in government and politics — it used to be all men, and it used to be all men. As we start to hear voices of men, we'll start to see an acceptance, and more and more men, and women start to move in the direction of what we were expecting," says Rushton. While some men do identify with the term "man" more broadly than others — some men say they consider themselves to be "feminine" — most people polled said their gender would fit into both categories, with men and women who said they saw their own gender as masculine roughly as equally likely to identify as "masculine" as those who identify only with their body's physical features, as well as those who identified as "feminine" or who said they were neither "masculine" nor "feminine." But while both men and women said that gender defined them, the gender of those who identified with both words — which the researchers used interchangeably — was largely unchanged from 1999 to 2013 — between 33 percent and 34 percent of self-identified men, and between 28 percent and 29 percent of self-identified women. The researchers believe their findings have profound implications for men's psychological well-being. Noting previous research on the positive emotional effects of masculinity, Rushton says men who are less interested in and more critical of their gender roles tend to be at greater risk of depression. But for those who identify as "masculine" but do not adhere to this image, these findings show a potential upside to less negative responses to gender roles. "People may be less satisfied with their own gender," says Rushton. "I think that would be something we would look for in our studies." Rushton adds that despite their apparent similarities to women, men feel comfortable with expressing more female-like traits that could make them feel more "masculine" than their gender labels suggest. For example, the study found that when asked to choose between two genders, half of men said they thought of themselves as "feminine" and half said they think of themselves as "masculine." The researchers say this gender overlap may be one reason why Americans were more likely to identify as male than female last year, according to the Pew Research Center. The researchers also speculate about the possible reasons behind the different ways in which men and women identified with their genders. For example, they theorize that some men may identify with their gender based	0
On Monday, the Supreme Court gave the final say over the state's "heartbeat" abortion law. The four justices split, as usual, about what the law does--or does not--do and the question before them today is whether the law will force abortion clinics to close down or go underground. In some ways, this issue is more complicated than the "two-thirds majority" ruling that the Court issued in March in Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt, which found that a Texas legislature had acted intentionally and purposefully to place severe restrictions on abortion access. The Texas law requires clinics to meet the building standards of ambulatory surgical centers and it puts a 72-hour waiting period on all abortions after the first trimester. The law also would require the clinics to have admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles--a step that many abortion rights advocates have deemed unnecessary since the vast majority of clinics already have hospital privileges. But there is also a broader question here regarding women's health. The Court in Whole Woman's Health also found that Texas's restrictions on abortion rights were designed to be especially damaging to women who had earlier miscarriages or who faced a severe fetal abnormality. The Texas law explicitly allows for any kind of abortion--including an induced abortion in which a doctor performs an "intact dilation of the cervix." These factors, which the Court has previously found to be relevant to the abortion restrictions, are not so relevant here. There is no question that women in Texas who undergo an abortion after a dilation abortion experience severe pain. In the same legal opinion that struck down Texas's law, Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote: In the end, the record in this case confirms that the pain of the abortion procedure can and does result in serious injury to a woman's emotional, physical, and mental health.... Even the best trained professional cannot ensure the emotional safety of women suffering such excruciating pain. As for the question of whether the state's law would make abortion clinics more dangerous for women to practice, the majority opinion in Whole Woman's Health has already dealt with that. In a concurrence written by Justice Sandra Day O'Connor--the majority author of the court's previous abortion rights decisions--the justices wrote: "Because of the nature of the surgery at issue, the likelihood of complication cannot be ruled out. In our experience, in-hospital dilation is very difficult, and the medical community's understanding of the surgery can be sketchy. Moreover, it is unlikely that a doctor performing the procedure for the first time would be competent to counsel her patient through the complications, either." To its credit, the court did not try to come to a "settled view" on what the new law might mean for abortion. Instead, it said that the law does the following: Requires abortion clinics to meet the building standards of ambulatory surgical centers...This requirement does not impose an undue burden on either the doctor or the patient. The requirements in the Act are minimal, and it requires a doctor to perform a very easy procedure. The patient cannot say that the doctor has subjected her to a significant delay or a significant inconvenience. The requirements do not violate the fundamental constitutional right of informed consent. The requirements do not prevent a doctor, in the course of carrying out his or her medical task, from communicating with a pregnant woman about the nature of the medical procedure, providing the woman with information about alternatives, and suggesting a course of treatment. While it may not eliminate the risk of abortions to women undergoing any kind of procedure, the decision today does signal that the Supreme Court will not tolerate the sort of surgical procedures that clinics must employ to provide abortions. As for what a decision by Justice Elena Kagan could mean for Texas' abortion law, the court could have a lot to say in March. In March, the court is scheduled to rule on whether Texas lawmakers have violated the 14th Amendment's ban on laws that place an "undue burden" on women's constitutionally protected right to choose abortion. If the Texas law is the sort of law that could raise red flags for the Supreme Court, the justices could be a lot more aggressive in striking it down if Justice Kagan agrees with the plaintiffs and strikes down Texas's restrictive law.	0

"What a shame that you're not my husband! I've heard so much nonsense about a wife not being able to keep a man, but I think you make a mistake in your thinking. You are the one that needs to prove yourself worthy of my love. I'm not looking for someone to take on the whole house cleaning as if you're a maid...or the whole household management duties.

As we go down the list of nominees for the 2014 Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Edition, we have some new names. In addition to last year's top-selling model Kylie McNeill, there's former Miss Florida Tara Conner, who has a similar look to what Rihanna wore while modeling for Sports Illustrated and is on a mission to spread the word of the magazine and model in the nude. And then there's the amazing Kate Upton, one of the hottest women in the world at the moment who's modeled in many issues of SI in the past. She had an interview with SI's Swimsuit Issue, and, I kid you not, it was a nude! Upton explains: "I never thought about modeling in a swimsuit before. And then it just seemed natural – because the way it works in the swimsuit industry is a lot of the models are naked… I think it's important to show the world what beauty can be like if you focus on it and you think about it and you make decisions for it, and you have confidence in it. And that's kind of what I do." "It's also a great opportunity to showcase women's bodies that traditionally may be under represented," Upton concluded. "I've felt that I don't have the same opportunities that other beautiful women have… To kind of shine a light and show the world how different a woman can be with just her body." We're not sure if it's the way she dresses, her attitude, or just her great sense of humor, but Kate looks like the perfect fit for some SI Swimsuit Edition covers. Do you agree with Kate? Comment below and tell us why you believe she's one of the top 25 hot models of all time! [Photo Credit: Getty Images]	0
A New Jersey police chief says a teenager from Jersey City made a threatening phone call to the city's mayor on Sunday morning.  "During the call, the suspect made an allegation of attempted murder concerning the mayor," Jersey City Police Chief Mark Peters said Tuesday after the teen turned 16. Peters said Jersey City police were called to the 18th Street Bridge in Bergen County around 11 a.m. Sunday for a report of a "suspicious person," not a threat. He said the teen was not armed and had no criminal record. Peters said while investigating, officers found a cell phone and several receipts belonging to the teen. When he was given a search warrant, officers found several items inside the teenager's bedroom and an unspecified amount of marijuana, he said. The teenager was charged with criminal possession of marijuana and endangering the welfare of a child, the chief said. He said the investigation is ongoing. Peters said he did not know the teen's age, though his phone had a profile photo for a person at the time of the call. Mayor-elect Steve Fulop, who will take office Tuesday, said he met Tuesday night with Jersey City police, who agreed to hold the suspect for the mayor's approval. Fulop said that would take place Wednesday at Bergen County Court in Freehold. The mayor-elect said the phone call could raise serious concerns about "security" in the city. "We had a guy who had threatened to kill the mayor in Jersey City," Fulop said. He said there are strict security measures in place in the city. "It's just very unnerving that the first place that a potential threat should be reported is a police department." Hudson County Sheriff's Office spokesman Jim McCarthy said the department and its detectives are investigating a separate call Sunday morning reporting that a group of people shot at a truck. He said the call came in as a false alarm, but when officers responded, they found two people, including one with a gunshot wound, who appeared to be intoxicated. They were taken to the hospital with non-life threatening injuries to their torso or limbs, McCarthy said. He said police believe that the incident may be related to the Sunday night incident. McCarthy said this was the second shooting of a vehicle suspected of being driven by an intoxicated person at the Bergen County Fairgrounds in one weekend, both in Ocean County. "The last incident was reported here during the Fourth of July weekend," he said. "The perpetrator left the scene on foot in this incident."	0
"When there are two sides, there's a war on." What follows are the quotes from the man who wrote the best-selling book that has changed the war on drugs, turned an entire national conversation from criminalization to legalization, and changed the fortunes of his most ardent critics, the police. Cops, stop your bullshit! (I have to go now, but you should read it!) by Chuck Baldwin What do you do when you witness the unspeakable? When the blood of an innocent child breaks the silence, when the mother cries out for justice, when the city screams for an end to mass incarceration? When you see what is happening as your police take the life of a young man. At 4:30 a.m. on Nov. 14, 2013, the two Albuquerque SWAT officers who had entered the room where 23-year-old Daniel Zamudio and his friend, Marlon Vasquez, were sitting, guns raised, shot their way through the door, killing both men. An autopsy showed that the men had been shot at least 10 times, perhaps as many as 15 -- all from behind. The police said they feared for the lives of the two terrified, unarmed people inside. But on Dec. 6, the Albuquerque Police Department, citing a judge's order, released the medical police report on Zamudio that showed he was unarmed when his friend ran at him with a knife, and the officers fired five shots, killing him within six seconds. This is the first time that the department has released the details from this incident. It's the only time that the police have been transparent about police shootings. But, as the medical report from the shooting of Zamudio says, he was not, and could not have been, armed. Why were these "officers" so terrified? That is a question that needs to be answered by the people -- the Albuquerque people -- who have been fighting for a long time to change what's happening in local police departments. If these men were armed and dangerous, that's a completely different matter. When confronted with someone wielding a knife, an AR-15 assault rifle or a handgun, Albuquerque Police Department members would fire first. But the fact that it was unarmed men killed at the door is the reason that the police can be so quick to deploy their firearms. The men in handcuffs Here's what the police found in Zamudio's apartment. The officers had found this room completely empty. There were no drugs, no weapons, no evidence of a crime. And there was no reason for the men to be handcuffed and locked in the hallway, in this spot on the floor. It seemed odd to handcuff the two young men inside their own apartment in the predawn darkness with no sign of a break-in. But this was not odd -- it was standard procedure. All across the country, cities and police departments routinely perform door to door searches of homes without any warrant, probable cause, or reason for a search. The only justification for these searches is that police are worried that people are hiding weapons. But if you're in your residence when police knock on your door at 4:30 a.m., the most they are really looking for is to find drugs. These officers had no reason to suspect that the men they shot were armed, at least not until they shot them, and then started firing again. These officers also had no reason to shoot Marlon -- not that they would have found anything illegal in his home or car, which he was walking out of before they fired at him. It was a senseless act of violence not just on both sides -- it is a senseless act of violence on our criminal justice system. It is impossible to be shocked by this video, because it has been in the news every day for the past month. But the Albuquerque police chief's decision to release the officers' bodycam footage after a court order -- a decision I and others criticized -- reflects a disturbing tendency among law enforcement in the United States -- and it reflects a disturbing shift in culture in the country. We are moving toward a climate of law enforcement that will only protect people if they can be shown to pose a danger. That climate is leading to the murder of more of our fellow citizens by police than by all other forms of violence combined. Albuquerque police have also changed since the incident, and that's the important thing for us to remember. The Albuquerque police have changed, and this is a great sign. Police are responding to social media with humor -- their first response to the shooting was to announce that they were giving out free cigars. That's good, but the real question is: Why would you shoot and kill two men who were trying to protect their own lives? The same question was asked of the officer who shot and killed	0
It's just an example Hello, just an example, because I wanted to see if this is something that does actually work or not. My goal is to make a script which performs a scan, but the output is a list of nodes which are "connected" to each other with n nodes, where n is 1,3,5,...,15 (as many as are possible), as you can see, I chose n = 15, because that is enough for me, it works for me and I do have a bit of experience with the format of a scan. The example is not that much complex (as compared to my more ambitious scripts) but it does work. The script is just running through and reading each line, printing the node names that are connected to the nodes and then writing out a text file with this information, in this way you can look into the whole scan as you wish. In addition to that you can see the same nodes are scanned a few times and then written out as text again. The following screenshot shows how I generated the file with a script like this in the same directory as the scan (the node list itself is not visible):	0
This is what Donald Trump's presidency looks like when the American system of checks and balances is taken for granted. Trump's first move was to appoint and fire senior officials. Trump, a billionaire whose company has done business with foreign governments, and whose net worth is unknown, apparently lacked the necessary security clearances. He fired a law enforcement official (Mark Halperin) who was investigating him and he has asked the attorney general to fire the special counsel now in charge of the investigation. That move is unlikely to succeed. It is no coincidence that the actions reflect the kind of authoritarian personality that has infected Trump's transition team and whose actions are now reflected in the government at large. That is what Trump's own words about Russian President Vladimir Putin mean for this nation. Trump's first action was appointing Steve Bannon as his campaign chief executive and chief strategist. This decision was based on the premise that his instincts as a political operative were superior to his experience in the mainstream Republican establishment. The president-elect is following in the footsteps of Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney who gave Bannon the key job heading his campaign's analytics operation as he was looking for a way to win the nomination. The chief strategist is the one that Trump talks most about with his closest advisers. Trump sees little distinction between them and Bannon is not to be trusted, but the president-elect is also impressed with him. But then Trump went a step further. Bannon said in an interview that he was going to be his "wingman." He had a role in bringing Trump's campaign message to the mainstream media and the Republican Party. Now it appears that will be his role inside the White House. Trump appointed as the head of his National Security Council the former Wall Street attorney Michael Flynn, who lied about meeting with the Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak prior to Trump's inauguration, and subsequently was forced to resign as Trump's national security adviser. He also chose Steve Bannon to be the White House chief strategist, but he recently admitted in an interview that he had also told Flynn about the plan to fire FBI Director James Comey without consulting Vice President Mike Pence. Trump is going to need to rely on his chief strategist if he is to make progress on issues like healthcare reform and repealing the Affordable Care Act, two major fronts in the battle against the Democrats in Congress. Trump has also fired Robert S. Mueller III as special counsel investigating his campaign team's ties with the Russians and a host of financial transactions by Trump and his associates for which they have been caught up. It might be a legal maneuver, but it would be a political one. Trump's reaction to the news is predictable. Instead of being grateful for the president who is taking a huge, important step in uniting the country and keeping it in charge of its own destiny, Trump tweeted "RESIST," adding "Fired FBI Director James Comey will be replaced by someone who will do a far better job, bringing back the spirit and prestige of the FBI." Trump's action and behavior were predictable from the moment he took office. He will use his new authority to advance his political and personal interests. To be a leader worth the title he will have to put aside his political ambitions and concentrate on the responsibilities and work of being commander in chief to get the country back moving and on track to the goals of its founding fathers, the men and women who built America.	0
The number of people killed by drivers under the influence of cannabis was found to be more than double that of those killed by alcohol, a study has found. Researchers from the University of Sydney found that drivers aged between 18 and 32 years old were over five-times more likely to experience a cannabis-related fatality than drivers aged 15-24 years old. "Youngsters often view cannabis as a harmless substance, yet it has the potential to be lethal to drivers," the study said. "The increased fatality risk from cannabis is significant and should be considered in any policy measures aimed at reducing cannabis-driving-related deaths." The findings came after a study found cannabis drivers were seven times more likely then those who had drunk alcohol to collide with a pedestrian. Drivers found to be under the influence of cannabis were also more than twice as likely to lose control.	0
How to set up a VPN connection What is a VPN?  A Virtual Private Network is a digital tunnel that allows you to access online resources over the Internet anonymously. This helps keep your private information hidden.  When you use a VPN, websites, online services, and people around the world, use a different IP address to connect to you. The IP address provided by your Internet Service Provider (ISP) can be used to track what websites you visit, track what Internet activities you perform, etc. If your ISP collects this information or uses it to track your behavior, it could be considered as cyber stalking or harassment.  Here at SurfEasy, our VPN servers use a unique and secure encryption protocol to let you access the Internet securely. SurfEasy uses these servers in Australia to protect your privacy.  SurfEasy uses PIA for its VPN application. It's a open cryptographic standard developed by Open Whisper Systems (OWS). It's designed to be flexible, easy to install, and secure. SurfEasy also supports multiple languages, including Japanese.  Before you use a VPN, you need to learn a few things about what the VPN is and how it works.

VPN traffic goes through a lot of Tor Exit nodes and Tor users would not have Tor. This could also include sites that are associated with Tor such as sites that promote sexual predators. There are also many other reasons why you would not want to use a Tor exit VPN. For example, we are not responsible for any IP addresses you use when you connect to our servers!  SurfEasy has a Tor exit option. This means you can browse the internet anonymously while on SurfEasy's VPN servers. If you use VPN software on your Android phone or computer you are also using a Tor exit.  Using a Tor exit helps protect you from the internet predators, sexual predators, and government snoopers.

What is a VPN IP address?  When you set up a VPN connection you must choose a unique IP address for your connection. This is the IP address you are using when you connect to the VPN server.  A VPN IP address can have a significant impact on how you are tracked. A VPN IP address is not the same as the IP address of your ISP which provides you access to the network. Your VPN IP address is not the same as the IP address of the VPN server that we connect to. For example you can use a VPN IP address that's different from any other IP address for our server.	0
I'm sitting in the kitchen of my apartment, which is full of books, maps, and various knickknacks. After two hours or so sitting, I'm tired and my eyes are watery. There's something different about the room, but I find myself unable to put my finger on exactly what it is. Then, out of nowhere, a pair of glasses appear on my counter. "These are really good," I tell the man, who is wearing a suit, an apron, and a mustache. "You have got to try them." Then I show him my room—three shelves of books, a dozen maps on top of each other, a dozen knickknacks like a giant backpack. He holds his hand up and takes a swipe. "I like your room, too. It reminds me of your home." The room itself has some resemblance to my own house—its patterned tiles and rugs, the chairs I use, the books and movies I keep in my house. In the kitchen, however, my house has been replaced by something a little unexpected. What you see is only my imagination, a house that never existed. I live on a property that is owned by a company called Trava House, which bought the property three years ago for a reported $15 million. For the last three years, I have resided here among a collection of people I call "Projects." These are people who have received $5 million to build some kind of architectural experiment; they call themselves "Circles of Influence." When I arrived, in 2012, they spent $5.7 million; this year, they spent $9.9 million, for a total of $21 million. At this point, I can't tell where the money will come from to finish building a house out in the desert. It may come from some kind of "open-source" project, or they'll borrow it from the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development. Or maybe they'll use the money to create a kind of community center. I'm in my apartment with two other people who live here: an artist named Daniel (he prefers his friends and family to only use their first names), who has a huge book collection; and an architect named William. They have been living here at Project Trava House for four years and are now living through every stage of construction. It's kind of like being in a traveling circus and hoping to escape that circus one day. I first came to Project Trava House with Daniel in 2012. Daniel had received his master's thesis about an architect he had met at the Architectural Center, and this had sparked a friendship that led to Daniel working on Project Trava House on his own. William was an architect who was in a position to do so. (William is one of dozens of prominent architects in New York City who do all of their client work in Trava House's studio.) Together, they founded Project Trava House, a community project whose goal is to create a house—any house—in the desert, in exchange for about $1 million a year of funding from HUD. It's like a small-scale utopian experiment, and there's a sort of science behind it, to be sure, but there's also a lot of free-flowing optimism, like when Project Trava House gets to work its magic on an unsuspecting neighbor (if not on them). The project has been criticized for the way it has re-invented the concept of sustainability, as well as the fact that it has been incredibly expensive. The project is located at 3600 East 7th Street, and it requires about a dozen people to run and staff the house for any given week. The group of developers and architects at Project Trava House has some interesting ideas about the way we move around in the world and how architects should do some of that, and some less interesting ideas about the way architects should just accept the consequences of a certain type of architecture. The group seems to believe that the construction of a large structure should result in an "artificial" environment—something that is "artificial," but not very good. (In case you're thinking: "Oh god, artificial! Can't that hurt someone who wants to find the perfect space?" Yes, it can; but I'd argue that it doesn't.) I also don't think that the group is well-suited to dealing with certain aspects of the city and urbanism. It may be a group of smart people who have made their way in the world through their skills and hard work with computers, but it's also a group of people who, I assume, have been living a lot of our lives indoors. If you've ever driven a car that didn't have a driver, you have some insight into what I'm talking about here. We might not have lived all our lives in apartments, but we've lived a lot of our lives inside buildings. The	0
"The people have to accept change and have to be ready to change," said Mark Levin. That's an interesting statement. What does it really mean? Levin says that "all that's needed is a new president," with a new Supreme Court justice, and that everything else can be worked out later. I'm not sure I agree with the latter statement at all. I think that the American experiment in radical change would have had its first major test in America with a Republican president. We'd need to confront and overcome the cultural, political and philosophical challenge to the nation's founding that would come with a GOP president, and even then there's no guarantee that everything would be fine. There are limits, but they are all well outlined by the Constitution and the checks and balances built into that document. The people would not take the chance. I disagree. Most of the time, you do not need a change in an incumbent president in order to have a radical change. The change that needs to be made is within the Congress itself. The people need to understand that they are the center of this nation's governance and should be expected to use the power they enjoy to change that governance. This year Republicans are going to get the opportunity to do just that. Let's hope they seize it and see this through.	0
(CNN) A group of U.S. scientists says that their data from the Hubble Space Telescope prove it: Ice covers more area on Earth's surface than previously thought. Scientists said the new discovery means that the oceans cover about one-quarter of the planet's surface, as opposed to previous estimates of 70% or more, according to a report in the journal Nature Advances . They added that this new ice coverage represents more than 100 million square kilometers more than previously estimated. Previous estimates, which covered only half of the planet, were based on satellite imagery from the late 1980s, CNN affiliate KCEN reported. Scientists had suspected that ice in the seas covered only about 10% of the Earth's surface. The new data may mean that sea levels have been rising at an unprecedented rate, causing the ice to shrink, according to a statement from the National Snow and Ice Data Center that accompanies the study on its website. It added that ice melt is the main driver behind the rise in sea levels. The study "adds a little more uncertainty to our long-term forecasts," said Christopher Rupkey, director of environmental economics and policy research at the Environmental Management Institute (EMI), a Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Berkeley, California-based research organization that published the study. NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, operates Hubble as part of an Astrophysics System Observatory (ASO) program. The discovery follows another recently announced ice cover discovery by the ASO group that led to the conclusion -- supported by the same study -- that the world's oceans have covered about 25% of the Earth's surface. The scientists were studying NASA's twin Hubble Space Telescope images to gain information about the Earth's climate. This is the latest in more discoveries of ice and water in the waters of the ocean. The Hubble photographs showed that the water of the oceans covers about 1% of the Earth's surface. The latest finding may mean that global sea levels are rising at an unprecedented rate, raising questions including how fast ice melting might cause sea levels to rise, according to Rupkey. The researchers calculated that the total ice covered in the oceans is equivalent to the area of the entire Greenland Ice Sheet.	0
A new ad from former GOP vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin and her campaign will be running in Nevada's Clark County ahead of next week's caucuses in the state, a county official and the local GOP chairman confirmed Tuesday. Palin's campaign will run an ad featuring a video featuring a child in rural eastern Nevada telling of his own story, as well as one of his mother raising their children in poverty in that county. "This is part of a larger ad we've done in a number of different locations nationwide: a child talking about what his mother does to make ends meet and how she raised him and how his mother raised him and how they all know the pain you have going on today and how we all stand together to change the world," said Brian Murray, chairman of the Clark County Republican Party and a deputy for Gov. Brian Sandoval (R). That ad has already aired in Reno, as well as the Las Vegas area, Murray said, which is why it will run in Clark County. "It's a positive thing because it's talking about a message about the future and trying to encourage people not to stay on the status quo," Murray said. Palin endorsed former Texas Gov. Rick Perry and Sen. Ted Cruz Rafael (Ted) Edward CruzBredesen says he won't back Schumer for Senate Dem leader Webb: The new mob: Anti-American Dems Ignored Latino vote will be key in future elections MORE (R-Texas) in the wake of Perry's departure from the race, and she will be back in the campaign in coming days if she does decide to run again for the White House. She has also been weighing in on the GOP presidential race. After the party's primary in New Hampshire, she called Donald Trump Donald John TrumpTrump: Dems playing destructive 'con game' with Kavanaugh Several Yale Law classmates who backed Kavanaugh call for misconduct investigation Freedom Caucus calls on Rosenstein to testify or resign MORE "a cancer on conservatism." "I think it's an opportunity to reach people because the Republican Party, we've never run away from our principles. We have never run to the right," Murray said, suggesting that the new ad is part of her ongoing effort to reach a broader audience with a clear message of economic responsibility. Palin and Perry have a long history in the state, with Perry serving as lieutenant governor in the 1990s and Palin co-hosting a radio show on the Perry administration's radio network. Both have been criticized for being insufficiently conservative, but Palin's endorsement of Trump has given her a boost in the polls there. The former Alaska governor is expected to appear on stage with the GOP nominee at a rally in Pahrump on Thursday.	0
Pineapple Sauce You can't beat the flavour of this classic and beloved Indian curry. With the crunchy, orange and sweet flavours of pineapple, this is just the ticket! The sauce is made of ingredients like kiwis, coriander, cumin and cardamom. A classic family recipe. Ingredients (Serves 6): 1 cup mangoes, peeled and finely chopped 1 can (25 oz or 750 ml) tomatoes 1 tablespoon turmeric 2 cups water 2 tablespoons sugar 1 tablespoon coriander seeds 1 teaspoon paprika 1 teaspoon ground cumin or cardamom Method Cut the tomatoes into small bits. Saute the onions, ginger and garlic in some oil until they start to brown. Add the onions, tomatoes and spices. Mix them together well. Add water to make it even thickest. Simmer the tomato paste for 8-10 minutes (for more heat) then add the cooked kiwi and simmer it for another 2-3 minutes. Meanwhile, in pan heat oil, add the crushed tomatoes, turmeric, coriander seeds and cumin. Saute on a medium flame for a couple of minutes and then add the water. Let it boil over a medium heat. Add a little salt and sugar, cover and keep simmering. Stir it regularly, or else it will be salty. When the tomatoes and water has evaporated and turn it off. Now add the mangoes and cover and keep simmering. Let the mixture boil about 5 minutes and then strain it well and add. Add the turmeric powder and mix it well. Curry is ready! You need about 30 to 45 minutes or more to make it the perfect texture. Serve it with rice or with chapati. Tips & Ideas Don't use canned tomatoes, especially in this curry recipe. Choose fresh ones whenever possible. The spices mentioned here are for the main spicy ingredients, you can add fresh chilies to the dish for a bit different flavour. You can keep the sauce chilled and serve it over rice and chapati, or serve it with rotis or naan. Pineapple (Pisang). This recipe was originally published on the blog of my dear friend Arun Kuriyan.

I'm not sure what happened to all of my posts, but I was so busy working on the book for the last year that I didn't have any time to write anything for this blog. I did write a whole post about how to make a good recipe video, so you should keep that in mind. So after a couple years of living in New York City and cooking at home, I have finally found time to focus on writing a book about the food I grow and cook: Sweet Dishes: From My Kitchen to Yours. As a child, my mom taught me everything she knew about cooking – that it's about using the right spices, the cooking time and temperature, the amount of sugar needed for just the right sweetness. When I was in college, when I worked in restaurants like Chez Panisse and the Spotted Pig, I learned everything – that it's about knowing your food, taking good care of your vegetables, that we all deserve to eat our best dish whenever we are having a party for Thanksgiving or some other big occasion. But most importantly, I learned what I should be doing in order to cook and eat food I love to my fullest and enjoy every bite that comes from my kitchen. Today, I'm going to share my tips and tricks for cooking with my hands. 1. Make your chopping board and knife sharp… …and get good at cutting and eating food A simple rule that I think can make a huge difference is using an equally sharp knife to cut your vegetables, while using a different knife to chop your food. When it comes to chopping, it doesn't matter if you have used your food knife on a vegetable before or if you bought a new one (that's what I did) – it doesn't do any good for your knife if your knife isn't sharp. Once you feel comfortable with your food knives, practice by chopping some vegetables with them. It's not rocket science… just keep learning. If you can't find sharp food knives, at least get yourself a cutting board that has nice sharp edges. It will also help you cut vegetables safely with them and will help you learn where your food knives and chopping board are on the chopping board. 2. Keep your food clean I'm a huge believer that food should be properly stored. You're not just saving a few minutes here and there, by placing all your kitchen trash where it can be easily retrieved; you're not only throwing away food that's not coming out right, you're also throwing out a lot of food that could have gone to good use. The kitchen is a very busy place and we usually have to clean out our sink every week or so. When we don't, it ends up overflowing with food. Also, as the weather gets warmer, it's not uncommon to see food going bad in a few days, even if you bought fresh produce. It's not that it makes any sense to keep rotten food in your refrigerator and freeze it instead, but I really like seeing how the food looks before it disappears forever. It makes me feel a bit better about what I put in my body! That is a promise! 3. Get a good cutting board I love my Bosch Classic Bento Board because it has a cutting surface of soft wood pieces and a metal tray. It comes with a great cutting surface… especially if you're going to use your kitchen knives. As with my other boards, don't be shy to ask for a high-quality board if you see one that's not right for your budget. You may just get lucky one day that you see a board that's really high quality! 4. Use disposable containers It's very simple. If I eat out at home and the ingredients I buy that contain a lot of ingredients that take longer to wash before I use them are all glass, i.e. pots and pans, glass containers, or disposable containers, I don't want to be doing the math when deciding which glass container to use to fill my glass cup, or how many dishes I use in one trip. For the same reason, if I'm going to prepare a variety of dishes and use a glass container that might not even be broken or dirty, I don't want to be wondering which container will work the best to clean my pots, pans, or glasses. If the ingredient is glass, I'm okay using non-glazed ceramic plates, even if they are slightly stained or scratched. I don't care. 5. Use utensils and knives that are pre-cut to the perfect size I'm really serious about this one. My old favorite, the 1.5-inch wide (or larger) chopsticks from the grocery store, will keep for years and years. And I'll use them. But if I'm going to prepare a dish with a lot of ingredients that have a tendency to break when handled (think fresh vegetables or fresh seafood), I don't want to be struggling with tiny chopsticks all	0
A few things I did when playing with the new release I wanted to test my new release on a few things. I wanted to see how it worked to load and save files as an admin (i.e. a user/group that has write access to the server and is able to create files) and I wanted to see how it worked to create a new user/group at the same time, i.e. a user/group that does not have write access to the server and can only create files. So I created three separate environments:  test-domain (the machine with Ubuntu, the installation files and everything else I needed was on the machine) (the machine with Ubuntu, the installation files and everything else I needed was on the machine) test-user (the user with write rights to and the server) (the user with write rights to and the server) test-machine (an empty, empty VM, I just made one folder with the configuration files and started working with the setup package)  As a user I went to the local machine (test-machine): 1. I typed: sudo apt-get update 2. I pressed enter 3. I tried to start the Ubuntu server from the server command line sudo service ubuntu start Nothing happened.  4. I pressed ENTER and rebooted the server (or did something similar) Note. That was on the machine with the installation files and everything else I needed was in it. On the test-user server I had only the server configuration file. No installation files and the files that allow me to start the server at boot. Now I wanted to use the new release and test it to see how it worked. I started up the test-domain machine (with the Ubuntu server at boot, not the test-user one) and did sudo service test-server start but the server failed to start.  I tried to start the test-domain server again. This time with: sudo service test-domain start and it was started. I started another virtual machine (on test-server), typed the install command for the user/group creation and got "could not get the user/group id for this user" at boot. I did sudo useradd --home-dir /var/lib/nginx/www/home/test-domain --exclude http://localhost  This created the user/group test-user and I was able to create a user/group at the same time.  For a while I continued with my test-user experiment and it all worked fine. I got everything I needed and installed my application. After a while I found a problem and after some investigation found out that the problem is this: My installation files are on the test-domain system (I just made one folder with the contents) and my installation is set up for single user in a non standard install.  So my application is not installed properly. It doesn't work for a user with local access to the server and needs to be installed in the other way around.  I'm using this environment for this very reason:  I want to be able to test the new release locally, without needing to go to the Ubuntu server and download everything. The only thing that needed to be changed was the configuration files (in the package files folder) and the location of the server configuration.  But then a few days ago I did sudo service nginx start and the new release just stopped working (for me). So I did sudo service nginx stop  and the new release stopped working too (for me). I'm not the first person to have problems with this new release.  My advice is: If you are using the server configuration file (the one with the /etc/nginx/conf.d/nginx.conf file) try to use the test-domains server, create user/group accounts and have them installed that way. and have them installed that way. If you just have to install the application for some single user do that too but have it installed on the test-domain system.  The reason the installation files are not used by the test-domain server is it is so you can install the latest versions without having to download the install script for every new release release.	0
In an interview with The Boston Globe, Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX) defended his stance on marriage equality with one clear message: "I believe in traditional marriage … as an orthodox Christian." "I truly think marriage is defined in the Bible, it's defined in the Book of Genesis as between one man and one woman," he noted. "Marriage is defined in the New Testament in Matthew 19:4, 'You shall love the sister as yourself.' The New Testament is full of Scripture that talks about loving people, supporting them, defending them and loving one another, and I think there's nothing in that passage of Scripture that calls for the recognition of gays and lesbians." The Bible does refer to one man and one woman being in wedlock, Cruz asserted. "In New Testament times and throughout the New Testament, Jesus teaches love for those who don't have a certain faith, whether that faith is Jewish, whether it is Gentiles, whether it's atheists, whether it's others," he added. "The point is, I do not believe this is inconsistent with orthodox Christian teaching." Cruz also cited his Christian faith as being what led him into politics and he explained why he did not believe gay marriage was a threat to traditional marriage. Cruz's comments come just a day after his running mate Mike Pence said he believes same-sex couples should have the same marriage rights as heterosexual families.	0
The number of homeless people sleeping rough in the UK has risen to its highest level for 11 years amid continued cuts to council budgets, a leading homelessness charity has warned. The National Alliance to End Homelessness (NAEH) said it was concerned by a trend towards increasing numbers of single adults with no children staying overnight in their homes. The charity said the rise in rough sleepers - who often have mental health, or other problems - was being made worse, in part, by cuts to local council budgets and a long-running national crisis over low levels of affordable accommodation. The Naeh said it was concerned that more and more people were finding themselves living in their own homes and having to live on a "very low income" as a result of the current economic climate. "The cuts to council tax benefit and housing benefit that has taken place have had an impact on the amount of income that comes from council tax, which makes people even more reluctant to move out of their home once the freeze or cut ends," said Naeh housing spokesman Kevin Stewart. Mr Stewart said some of the "dreadful" experiences he knew of "could not have ever happened under the last government". In the past three months, for example, a father who had been out of work for 12 years was sleeping rough for the first time in his life. "This could never have happened under the last government. It's a completely different picture now," he said. "There's clearly more people than at the height of the last recession; it's a very worrying one for people who were at the end of their tether in terms of money." He said the problem was not solved by housing benefit and council tax benefit cuts, saying that more could be done to increase the number of homeless people living independently in their own properties rather than in temporary accommodation. The issue is causing major consternation among the government, with Prime Minister David Cameron facing increasing pressure to tackle the issue. The latest government consultation on reforming homelessness - which resulted in "treaty" proposals before the May election - has resulted in a raft of reforms aimed at helping people avoid homelessness.

 A lot of people who are not familiar with JVM internals still seem to think that the JVM just runs its own Java process with an interpreter. This is not the case. Although the JVM is the first application, it is certainly not the last. What you have in this article are a few of the last applications to run on the JVM. In my opinion, what you find here are the last of the few "good old days". These applications are not perfect, but they demonstrate the evolution of Java applications over time, and they show the development methodology that is used in the JVMs today. This methodology is not new, but it has changed a lot. In the next sections, I'll have a look at a few of the last programs running on the JVM. The first section will focus on some of the most advanced JVMs of the time—the J2SE ones (e.g. Sun and Oracle products). The following articles will focus on the development methodology used in the early years of the Java language itself, e.g. the early JetBrains products. In every article of this series, I'll try to explain the background behind the application, and hopefully, even convince the reader, if necessary, to give a look into the source code. The last Java programming applications In the first part of this series, we explored the evolution of the Java ecosystem and how it is used today. I'm gonna tell you a lot of stories, starting from the very beginning, and then, through the whole Java development lifecycle: writing the code, testing it, making bugs fixed, optimizing the code, deploying it. It is definitely more challenging to do so, and it has many more details, but the purpose is the same. It is all a part of the continuous process of improvement in Java. J2SE first, then Java SE The history of the Java virtual machine is, however, a bit more complicated. When the first programming languages such as FORTRAN and COBOL were developed, the notion of an "executable file" had not been introduced yet. Java, by the way, was originally named "Coc" (Cobwebs) and was written as a language for the operating system Cobol in the 60s. Later, in the early 70s, the company who would go on to develop the Java world-wide, Sun Microsystems (later Oracle, and now Oracle Corporation), called their new language "Java". So we have the two versions of the JVM, JVM 1 and JVM 2, both in the "public domain". Both versions were designed not only to run the JCL-based programming languages, but also a few other types of programs, such as shell scripts, graphics editors and other applications used for general purpose programming. There were two major issues with these implementations: firstly, they were hard to compile and run on modern CPUs. And secondly, they were big and bulky—over 200 kilobytes (KB) for JVM 1, and over 400 KB for that of 2. The problem was that the new JVM versions were huge (in all implementations, around 4,000 KB). This made it hard (if not impossible) to move them into smaller, faster and/or cheaper CPUs. Because it had to be able to run any number of smaller applications, and because most of these applications had only been run once, the JVM 2 had to be really small. It had to compress everything, and also compress the source code. However, even though there are some smaller JVM implementations, they are very old—in the first two years of its existence, it was used only by the Java virtual machine, and most of the implementations are no longer supported by Oracle. Because of these issues, the JVM's development was a challenge. It took a long time and a lot of effort for the JVM to be able to run more and more types of applications. And even now, many of these applications still run on top of the JVM—but very, very slowly. For example, Java applications today will run a lot slower because most of them will require the presence of the JVM to execute and compile them. However, there are some applications today that are compiled directly into the JVM. These might be some of the most interesting programs in the Java world, or it might be some of the most useless programs ever. There are a few things that I think are worth telling you about the JVM from the beginning. Some of them are well and obvious, while others might not be immediately apparent. Let's start with the obvious one: The JVM is really really slow! Yes. And by "really really" I don't mean that it runs at maximum clock-rate. The JVM is really really slow. Really. Slow. This is really big. This is only what you get	0
Rafael dos Anjos is still training, but is not close to a return. The Brazilian lightweight champion was scheduled to make the long flight up to Orlando from his native Brazil but was forced to cancel due to the Hurricane Irma. Dos Anjos is expected to make his return in early December once the conditions die down a bit and be in the clear from his injury but still wants the UFC to get him back on a date. Dos Anjos told Sportradar he will meet with USADA and look to fight in December. "The most important thing is to be 100 percent healthy now and prepare for a big fight on December 4, 6 and 8 in Las Vegas," dos Anjos said. He admitted that he hadn't spoken to anyone in the UFC regarding an immediate return. "In January I will have another round for the fight that's on next year and I'll meet with [UFC president] Dana White directly. Maybe in the beginning of next year." In his absence, UFC welterweight Nate Diaz has taken over against Eddie Alvarez and in his first fight against Nate Diaz he got the best of the champion and put the former champion on the shelf. Diaz-Alvarez 2 was not a great fight to begin with but Alvarez did a good job against Diaz and has come home with both belt and the interim lightweight title of the division. Alvarez believes dos Anjos would be a big threat to his belt and is confident dos Anjos would take him down and beat him in the ground. Dos Anjos has said he isn't concerned about a return from injury and is focused on the December 4 fight with Eddie Alvarez.	0
[NOTE: I had not done any real analysis on this so I'm basing this on what it says on the T-Mobile site. It's not exactly easy if you want to figure out T-Mobile's subsidy vs. cash value for prepaid.] "We believe in the tremendous value prepaid customers bring to customers. We're going to continue to build strong prepaid business that offers customers a strong value proposition and we're putting all of that in place for the new year," T-Mobile CTO Neville Ray said at the T-Mobile Un-Carrier 10X Summit in Fort Worth, Texas. T-Mobile's prepaid business has been on a good run all year, adding nearly 100,000 new customers each weekend. But with the T-Mobile Un-Carrier 10X initiative getting rolling, T-Mobile is moving to a prepaid model. The new model is known as Value Plan. Here's how it works: "You pay $30 / month for a phone and use it on our Prepaid Plan," Ray said. "Once you have 100 minutes, you'll get it back by paying 30 minutes the following month. It's like having your own phone network and unlimited data." What this means is that customers can get a phone for the same price as the high end iPhone, and then turn around and charge them $30 if they want to use it for calling and texting. T-Mobile's prepaid business is now one of the fastest growing consumer smartphone offerings. So this new model is a great way to get customers who usually aren't likely the best customer support out of their phones. It also keeps down the cost of the smartphones. "We're going to give our customers, our prepaid network customers, an option to be able to upgrade their phone in the near-term, and keep their phones on the network and on the bill cycle and also be able to switch phone carriers," Ray said, "and do all that over 30 months at no cost to our subscribers." We have a detailed review of T-Mobile's Prepaid Plans here.	0
There's just one problem! How to know if you are or are not a "real" Muslim (and not some sort of shirk)? According to the shari'ah, you've got some big questions to answer: "Do you consider yourself a Muslim?" The answer depends on your beliefs, and there are three kinds of Muslims in the world, one of which is "true" (tasawwuf), the second is "believed" (istahaad), and the last is a "fake" (kafir). Of these three, only the genuine ones are real Muslims in the eyes of the shari'ah. Is one of the three types genuine, and thus a Muslim? No, that's just "kufr" (unbelief). The first type: "I am a Muslim." Or, if you're a muslim, you're a "true" one and therefore a "true Muslim." And there's really no difference between true and true. The second type: "I'm a Muslim, but not at all. Some people call me a fake Muslim (kafir)." That's just "in order to justify his sinful conduct." The third kind: "I'm a Muslim, but in the form or shape of a shaheed." This is called (takfir), "the perversion (zahir and shirk)" of the Prophet (peace be upon him)." So…who will you be in the eyes of the shari'ah? As for the second question… I think that the answer depends upon your view of the Qur'an and the Sunnah. If you believe the Qur'an and Sunnah are perfect and perfect and perfect, then you will be a Muslim, as we all should. The problem is, you'll end up being a fake one. The problem for the person who will become a genuine Muslim… The second one is more difficult to understand, because it depends upon whether you believe in the shari'ah. If you do, then you will just be a Muslim of a few other characteristics. If you believe the Qur'an (and its narrators) are perfect, there is little difference between a real and a "fake" one. And since the Qur'an is the final authority in all matters and it is the best of guidance for all people, it is legitimate for you to believe and act upon it. But, if you think the Qur'an is imperfect and therefore can be flawed, then you think you'll also be a "fake" Muslim. Therefore, your view of the Qur'an will determine whether you are or are not a genuine Muslim. But there's a difference. So why can't we just follow what we believe in? We can see from the Qur'an that the Qur'an is based upon knowledge of the Qur'an! So if you know from the Qur'an that you should be a real Muslim… and it's based upon knowledge and you know from the Qur'an the "real" version, then that's going to have no difference from you being a fake Muslim. But why can't we just follow what is "observed" in the Qur'an or from the Sunnah, and ignore what we believe in? Because what we believe in matters, and that's what makes up our religion that we call shari'ah (that's what the word shari'ah means — meaning the law), and shari'ah makes up the core belief of true Islam. And the core belief is a core belief about the religion based on an actual, verifiable, authentic source (the Qur'an and Sunnah, for example): We say: There is no god but Allah and Mohammed is the messenger of Allah. The Sunnah is the life of the Prophet. It is the "proof" of the faith (tafsir). As such, we must believe in it, and must take it as the absolute word of Allah, and all "revelations" from it. The core belief in the Prophet (peace be upon him) and his religion is the truth regarding Allah, so it is the core belief of true Islam. What other belief can we bring into it that is not "observed"? The reason we have the "official" or "official" interpretation (i.e. the "most correct" one) of the Qur'an is as such: It was revealed to the Prophet by God… so it should be taken as the Word of God and not "observed" as it is. This is why it is taken "as is" with no attempt to alter the message in any way whatsoever, and	0

It is typically only used against robots, but has been used as a defensive measure against radscorpions, ghouls, mutated brutes, super mutants and super mutant brutes.[1] Characteristics Edit The plasma pistol possesses the same effects as the plasma rifle, except that the plasma has a slower rate of fire and deals half as much damage. However, its lack of recoil and the more efficient ammo it uses allows for a much longer effective range. Like the plasma rifle, plasma pistols are relatively lightweight, especially at higher levels, making the pistol a viable long-range weapon, though still less than the rifle.

As such, it has no unique stats whatsoever and only an attack damage value of 30. The plasma pistol can be made into the plasma rifle using the workbench, but does not receive any effect from the energy cell. In-game, plasma pistols have the same base damage as the plasma storm. It may require more than 4 energy cells to create a plasma pistol fo5a. The fo5a does not have a unique prefix for its laser sights as with the fo4, fo4a and fo3a; however, its foregrip will be a different pattern than the other three fo3 weapons.

The U.S. government will pay $12.9 million to settle a lawsuit brought by the owners of a Washington, D.C.-area yoga studio that accused agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation of conspiring to extort them with false accusations of criminal activity. Yoga Studio, in Reston, Virginia, has a "No-Nose Policy." This means that customers must wear their own noses to join the studio for class. The studio's attorney, Paul Kedrosky, said his client was subjected to FBI harassment during its litigation. "The FBI targeted and intimidated my client," Kedrosky said. FBI spokeswoman Laura Eimiller said the agency is prohibited from discussing specifics of ongoing investigations. But she said the bureau is "actively working" with its law enforcement partners in seeking ways to encourage "responsible business conduct." The investigation into Yoga Studio was not the only one brought by federal authorities against a yoga studio in the Northern Virginia area. Last spring, a similar lawsuit was brought against a studio in Sterling in Loudoun County. In that case, a judge dismissed all counts, according to the American Civil Liberties Union, which represented the Sterling studio. Federal authorities have pursued a number of business practices related to yoga and spiritual groups in the past decade, as well as investigations into alleged criminal activities by spiritual groups and individuals at yoga studios. A 2010 Department of Interior report on religious liberty, which focused specifically on religious and spiritual organizations, was the first government study of the practices of yogis, or as they are called, namaskar, since the 1990s. The report noted that the practice had been "abruptly and negatively impacted" by the practice of yoga poses known as ashtanga and vinyasa, particularly the use of these practices by yoga studios. The report called the practice "dangerously invasive" to the body and called for stricter enforcement of restrictions on yoga studio permits and "special regulations" for such companies for the purpose of protecting against "violations of federal or state law." The report noted that in Washington, D.C., the "use of yoga poses by yogis" and "the teaching of yoga to minors" require permit application and approval by law enforcement, "which creates a barrier to the practice among a very small number of individuals who should be able to practice and obtain permits." The Interior Department report's recommendations to law enforcement in the District of Columbia and Prince William County, Virginia, were to "prohibit all criminal activity and criminal activity by yogis," and "not permit any person or business to be or to conduct businesses, activities, or conduct business that is, as to a particular yoga studio, criminal related." A 2007 letter to Yoga Studio owner Alysia Pappas from the U.S. attorney in the Eastern District of Virginia and the FBI's Richmond field office said in part: "Beginning March 22 and continuing through April 4, 2007, and during that specific period of time, your business was the subject of a wide range of investigations in relation to criminal activity, including but not limited to … (Criminal Infiltrating) and wire fraud." In his filing in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia on Thursday, Kedrosky claimed that his clients were "effectively targeted and harassed" with a variety of tactics. These tactics included, Kedrosky alleged, "harassment, threats, intimidation, violence and physical harm." Kedrosky said the FBI took the investigation into Yoga Studio "very seriously" and "investigated thoroughly." "Based on the evidence and our findings and evidence presented at trial, the government has found that this case was brought out of a desire by the FBI's Virginia field office to protect its operations," Pappas' attorney, Robert O'Neill, said of the settlement. The court filing says that since the April 2006 settlement, Yoga Studio has received no money from the Department of Justice. Pappas' attorney wrote that she agreed to the settlement in order to get back in the yoga business and regain her reputation at the class level. Pappas, who had been certified in yoga and hatha yoga, sued the FBI, the Eastern District of Virginia and the Richmond field office in a federal lawsuit. The Eastern District of Virginia claimed in a motion to dismiss the lawsuit that a "vast amount of evidence" did not support claims involving extortion. It said no evidence supported the conspiracy theory asserted in the complaint: that Yoga Studio's members posed for nude photographs, that customers were extorted to pay for the services of an undercover agent, and that yoga staff were threatened with arrest or prosecution if nude photographs were taken. The U.S. attorney's office in Arlington filed a opposition to the motion to dismiss, stating in part that Yoga Studio's activities and conduct had resulted in "harassment and intimidation of the people who run yoga studios	0
Rudy Giuliani said on Wednesday that Hillary Clinton and her supporters want to turn the United States into Venezuela. The former New York City mayor made the remark while criticizing the former secretary of state on Fox News's "Fox & Friends." "She needs to realize that [Bernie] Sanders supporters are sick and tired of being told what the rules are, and she needs to give them a few more rules," Giuliani said. "The Sanders campaign, we have a different attitude. Not only am I supporting her against him, she needs to give me rules. She doesn't give them to me, and I don't give them to her." Giuliani added that Clinton "fights hard against socialism" — a reference to Sanders' support for a socialist model to overhaul the country's education system. He added that she didn't understand what social welfare means or why it's important. "The system is failing a lot of Americans," Giuliani said. "And it must be changed because what it is is a big part of American culture and it needs to be changed because you can't make a change without changing what's there."	0

When the first images of the Samsung Galaxy S8 were released in June 2016, I was eager for the best flagship smartphone I'd ever seen. My interest was not shared by everyone around me, but this was an important phone for Samsung to unveil that marked the beginning of what would become a five-year streak of great smartphones for the company. The Galaxy S8 brought many of the original Galaxy S features to a new generation of smartphone and brought Samsung's own software features to the forefront of the Android phone ecosystem. Since then, the S8 has been a hit, and in this article we're taking a deeper look at the Galaxy S8, including a look at two different batteries and a look at the Samsung Galaxy S8 battery replacement program, which we'll cover in our full review. The Samsung Galaxy S8 is the phone everyone is talking about. What is the Samsung Galaxy S8? What does it do, and how does it compare to its competition? Let's find out. 1. The Galaxy S8 is a big phone To me, the Galaxy S8 is the best phone that Samsung has ever made. If you compare it with the Galaxy S7 Edge, you'll see that its bigger screen size means that there is more content available and better images and video. The size of the device is impressive, and the new Galaxy Note 8 makes some interesting hardware decisions that make this display as bright and vivid as possible. And the Infinity Display with its larger bezels still looks great. But the S8, at 5.8 inches, is also larger than the iPhone 7 Plus, which is 5.5 inches; the Google Pixel XL, which is 5.0; the iPhone 7, which is 4.7; and the LG G6, which is 4.8. I was especially surprised that the S8 is almost as big as Apple's iPhone X, which is 6.8 inches, and that the S8 is just over 12 percent bigger than the Samsung Galaxy Note7. There are two more noticeable differences between the S8 and the newer iPhone X and Note 8. One is curved, curved edges, which makes the glass on the corners much more resistant to breakage, though again, this is only a cosmetic difference. The other is a metal body that feels sturdy and well-made. This metal body is covered in Gorilla Glass 5 that's super resistant to fingerprint smudges. Unlike the glass, the metal is super smooth and feels very comfortable to use. There have been some complaints about scratches, but if you're used to a more durable body, it's not noticeable at all. I also found the S8 to be more comfortable to hold in general. I think the S8 has a better curved touch-screen, which is something I love about the iPhone X but I found disappointing on the previous Pixel phones. The S8's display is also easier to view on one's face, which is great for a person with large eyes and long ears and nose. One thing I did find annoying, though, is the S8's tendency to slide on the smooth, metallic backing of the phone when it's placed on a surface. This seems odd but not actually a problem. The phone feels great on the outside, though. All in all, I love the design of the Samsung Galaxy S8 and I have no doubt that it will appeal to many. This video explains how to use the S8 in a pinch. https://t.co/XRqW3XzNrH pic.twitter.com/QjJY6tXxHc — Stephen Tulloch (@stephentulloch) December 1, 2017 2. All your Galaxy S8 phones will be unlocked and able to work on other carriers The Samsung Galaxy S8 can be used on any carrier, even Sprint. You can buy the unlocked device, so there's no need to buy a Galaxy S9 to use it on Verizon. You simply need to set up the activation and your phone will be on an unlimited data plan. You also won't need a data plan if you sign up for the Samsung Galaxy Prime service. You can pay by month or go all out and pay $20 for the full year of service. That means it will cost you a lot less and you can use your phone whenever you want without being tied to any one plan or plan provider. The Samsung Galaxy S8 has been announced for $769 on contract, but you can get the same smartphone with no contract without paying a monthly fee. The Samsung Galaxy S8 will be on AT&T and T-Mobile for $50 down and $20 per month or $200 down for 24 months. All other carriers except AT&T and T-Mobile will allow you to buy the unlocked device with no contract. You can sign up for unlimited data on all carriers with the Samsung	0
A group of about 2,000 Muslim women marched this morning in the capital city of Jakarta and held up banners with the slogans "Allah is Great" and "This is our future." The event, which was the first one of its kind in Indonesia and took place at the historic Haji Ali Dang Bugra mosque in the capital's outskirts, was held to commemorate the start of Ramadan, one of the holiest seasons in Muslim tradition. The event also coincided with World Economic Forum, an annual meeting of the world's biggest businesses and governments. "This is not the first time that we've gathered. We've always gathered together and shared stories and issues," said Adi Faria, a 26-year-old Muslim woman and one of the organizers of the event. The women shouted to the crowds gathered in front of the mosque that "if Allah was great, we would be great as well." "The whole world is suffering, and we need to do our best on our own and not rely on anyone, including Islam or the government." The women marched towards the National Palace in front of the prime minister's residence and held up banners reading "Freedom of opinion. Equality for women." A majority of the crowd appeared to be young and the event was attended by a number government officials. Faria also said she felt grateful for the government's support on the issue of women's rights. "I can understand the government's reluctance to have issues related to religion. [But] I believe that Indonesia is stronger because of Islam," she added. Despite the government's support, it was not immediately clear when the march would take place again. Faria said the event was meant to be symbolic and could change nothing in the lives of Muslim women in the country. The Muslim Women's Association (TAPEM) was also invited by the government to host a similar event earlier this week, but organizers refused to participate, according to Reuters.

The new generation of mobile devices is the hottest topic right now, but there are still no signs that there is anyone in the market that plans to make a success of the phone market. On the other hand, there exist those who believe that there are several reasons for this situation: they believe that the market is a big "screw loose" that needs "reinforcing" and therefore have a theory that the only way is to sell phones directly to the people. Those of us that are passionate about this idea do not accept these assumptions and instead prefer to propose the following idea: that we might just have a "screw loose" that needs "reinforcement": the mobile market. A phone is a gadget that lets you communicate with your friends around the world, whether in real time, or through the transfer of a video file. No matter how far or how cheap technology gets: it is still your phone that you have with you at all times. It has a screen and a tiny piece of hardware at its heart. As the number of contacts grows by the minute, so the need for an ever-slightly more powerful phone increases. The "courage" part comes from the fact that you cannot sell a phone to others. In the end, you are the only one who has access to the phone you have. In a few short years more and more people with smartphones will come to see their phones as just another gadget – and the same as a personal computer or camera: something that you carry with you, that can be used for doing something or kept in the pocket. And, of course, you will pay for them – which is not much if you consider the time, effort, and trouble that you will find in doing so. And the fact that you may have no way of buying or renting new phones doesn't make the situation better for anyone. On the contrary: that will make the situation much worse. There you have it. The reason why we think that the mobile market needs "reinforcement". In a world dominated by Facebook, there are already a number of new mobile apps that take advantage of the platform. Apps can work on multiple platforms, like smartphones, tablets and desktop computers, and are able to make a profit out of the network effect. However, if you can't actually talk with your friends, get the latest information or share photographs at will, this is a non-starter. With the mobile market only going up, the number of people using apps grows. Eventually this crowd will reach a tipping point, when Facebook starts seeing its first profits. It may be difficult for them to convince their users that they are creating profits, when everyone still has a simple personal computer and a large collection of photos. The next time Facebook needs a new business model – maybe after they buy or merge with some other social app – there will be plenty of users ready to jump on board if the new company has a really impressive new service to offer. Or at least, that will be the case if people aren't able to share anything over the phone anymore. A lot of people will find a new way to stay connected, which is exactly what Facebook has been doing. When mobile users lose their access to the internet, the effect will be much stronger than you know. That is, a lot of people will be disconnected and Facebook will benefit a lot from this. But we cannot be sure that every single one will do the same. For example, there are a lot of parents with kids – they are very likely to find a new way to keep them connected outside of the family. Even though social networks were started for children, a lot of people use them for their parents, to keep in touch or, better, because they are curious and want to learn more about what their kids say in their sleep. Maybe the last few months we have seen how the internet is disappearing from the lives of a lot of people. As a result, a lot of people have started using the internet as a way to learn about new and exciting technologies. That is, if you can still access the internet, you probably are also interested in computers or science in general. The only way of getting a lot of people to stay connected is the only plan that has a chance – if it's not just another one of the Facebook services that offers to you some really good perks to do the same thing over the web. Of course, there are many other apps that, to a lesser degree, compete with Facebook. But they are basically trying to solve a different problem. The main problem that all apps face is the fact that the people that you are talking with are not going to use the internet themselves. It's too slow, they know that their friends, family or colleagues are more productive on their device – and are going to use those devices anyway, so they can't wait to use those services again. So it's clear that the only strategy that will gain traction, is one	0
Django's template engine, known simply as django.template , provides some handy language constructs for making your template files easier to read, write, and maintain. Among these constructs, we have template inheritance. When a template inherits from a parent template, it adds additional constraints to that parent template, and it also removes some. These features are designed to make your template programs faster and easier to maintain. We use the concept of inheritance because template inheritance is a very powerful way to make templates more efficient and readable at the same time. Let's say a template for a list of customers has all possible values, and the following line is added: print_list(view) Since this template has the full set of available choices, it can be simplified into a single line of code to generate HTML: def print_list(view): print "#{view.name}: #{view.list.size}" print ' ' print view.viewname You can view this template by using the following URL in your browser: It's possible for all of the template files in these views to inherit the attributes of the parent views, meaning that each of this views' nested templates can use an array-based syntax to override the attributes of one of the parent templates. In this case, it would look something like this: from template.view import show_list from myapp.models import Customer from template.list import print_list # All print_list templates in the template hierarchy will inherit a template_name # attribute, which contains the name of the view inherited from # template parents . The default value for # this attribute is " myapp/customers/list.html#my-list-view " print_list( show_list ( view = show_list )) A more complex example, showing three levels of inheritance, is shown below: # Each new template inherits an additional template_name attribute to its parent # template. # The default value for this attribute is " myapp/customers/list.html#my-list " class CustomerList ( TemplateList ): model = Customer def show ( self , * args , ** kwargs ): print '<h1>Customer: #{self.model.name}</h1> ' print view . viewname Note that while template inheritance is very powerful and handy, it also has a downside. Because template inheritance does not hide the template hierarchy, the fact that a template inherits from parent templates means that any templates that have already been generated can no longer be displayed by those views; if you want to display a view that already generated a template, you must render it with a different name . You may also find that this is a problem if you want to include a view that is part of a nested directory into your site. Templates can also use regular expressions in their file names, so that they can match the names of parent templates. To demonstrate this, the following view is included in the template hierarchy of the app: from template.view import show_list from myapp.models import Customer from template.list import print_list # All print_list templates in the template hierarchy will inherit # a template_name attribute, which contains the name of the template # inherited from template parents . The default value for this # attribute is " myapp/customers/list.html#my-list-view " print_list( show_list ( " #{customer.name} " )) # A nested template with a template name of "customer_list.html#customer_list-list" is allowed # because it inherits from "customer_list.html#customer_list". print_list( ' #{parent.name} ' ) # You can't include a nested template in a list view as it inherits # from nested-list , which doesn't include the nested template name. print_list( show_list ( nested_list . viewname )) If template inheritance were applied to the above example, show_list would be able to print the name of the customer because the show_list template inherits from template parents / nested_list . This is an example of the limitations of inheritance: as of Django 1.7, only attributes will be inherited from parent templates, not methods on them. If you want to get some more control over how template inheritance works, you can use the template_has_attribute and template_has_method methods. Both of these methods return True , indicating that either parent.has_method(X) or template.has_attribute(X) is present in the parent template. template_has_method works the same way as template inheritance, but it checks the parent template for a has_method method and returns True if one is present. template_has_attribute is a similar utility that also checks the parent for an	0
Image caption The BBC's Panorama programme revealed claims of abuse and exploitation in Rotherham The BBC is to give a further $55m (£38m) to fund its investigation into child sexual exploitation in Rotherham, the broadcaster has announced. The amount of the investment and what it will be spent on will not be announced until later, but it is understood the money will be spent to fund additional staff. The money will not go towards the £90m Rotherham abuse and trafficking scandal. It will instead be spent on programmes and initiatives to tackle child sexual exploitation, including children's voices. The BBC's Panorama programme last month exposed allegations of widespread abuse in the city. The programme accused the town's children's services of turning a blind eye to "the scale and nature of serious abuse". 'Tackling and understanding' Image copyright PA The BBC's Panorama programme revealed the scale of abuse in Rotherham Earlier the BBC said it would not be pursuing other legal action, but it said it would "work with the Attorney General and our editorial processes to address any future issues raised relating to the way in which the BBC handled the Rotherham abuse stories". This followed a request from the Home Office for the BBC to "co-operate fully" with their investigation. BBC Director-general Tony Hall told MPs the broadcaster had to "acknowledge that when it comes to dealing with any issue like this the risk of any story is the story itself can be damaging to a corporation's reputation". He announced the funding would also be used to "tackle and understand, both in-house and with outside experts", the complex nature of child sexual exploitation across the UK, and to fund the creation of a new project. The new project, which could be launched later this year, could be renamed "A Child, A Child." The new money will also be used in the future to pay for "all necessary legal costs", but Mr Hall said that funding is not a requirement for this purpose. The BBC's announcement comes amid a new police inquiry into child sexual exploitation by Asian gangs, and a "national conversation" around how public bodies and organisations protect children.	0
From the looks of it, it's been a long, busy year for the National League MVP race. Just days after Miguel Cabrera won the award, it's been Jose Altuve's turn to go head-to-head with Aaron Judge. The Detroit Tigers first baseman, who is up for the Silver Slugger award, is going up against the New York Yankees' right fielder. The two are off to an inauspicious start. Ahead in the voting is Judge, who is leading the MVP race at 42.3 percent compared to Altuve's 23.1. Judge has led in each of the first 10 races, with several of the voters choosing Judge in just their first ballots. He also has led in every year in the first 10 races. Altuve also leads at 43.6 percent, while teammate George Springer is second at 23.2. It's the first time in history an MVP has been chosen in his first ballot. The biggest story, however, is that Altuve has already been named an All-Star starter at the third time that he's pitched since his arrival in Houston the season before. He is pitching in his second All-Star Game and this time, he is slated to take the mound as the team's third starter. "It's just a great honor to pitch in an All-Star Game again, especially from your teammates, especially the fans," Altuve said as he warmed up before Friday's game. "To be the starter, I'm very grateful and I love it." Other players to start an All-Star Game before Altuve are Roger Clemens (2000), Paul Molitor (2001), Dennis Martinez (1999) and Roy Halladay (2012). This is the eighth All-Star appearance for the 23-year-old Altuve, who will be making his 15th career start at Wrigley Field Sunday. Overall, Altuve has started for the Astros in 10 games, including four this season. "As a young player, I've watched a few and they seem to grow on you. One thing about Jose is he's always ready for any challenge," Astros manager A.J. Hinch said. "I'm sure he thinks that about this, too, I'm sure he thinks the MVP for me is a real possibility. I have a lot of confidence in this kid, even for the first time to an All-Star Game." Hinch did say he's a little worried about a possible injury in his starting lineup, which is set to be trimmed to 24 from the 25 starting spots. "Just think about it this season when you've got [James] Shields out there and [Michael] Pineda. I'm a little worried we might have a little problem there, even without Altuve. That's the thing with our starting rotation we've got a pretty deep group," Hinch said. "You know, I'm kind of a conservative kind of guy, but if we can have everybody available, it would be nice." Cabrera will be honored at the All-Star celebration in Cincinnati, Ohio. He will wear the Venezuelan national team jersey he wore when he earned the 2012 World Series MVP. With the Astros, Cabrera has been a two-time Silver Slugger winner (2015, 2016), four-time All-Star (2010-15), seven-time Gold Glove winner (2009-2013), seven-time Silver Slugger (2006-09) and six-time All-Star.	0
Trouble in the family? You are, to some, the devil. Or, at least, you're one of Satan's chosen. In The Curse Of St. Anne, William Golding, whose novels (The Lord Of The Rings, Jeeves and Wooster, etc.) informed our childhood's imagination, describes some of the worst of this trope – or at least is probably responsible for it. Advertisement "Many of them had the most violent and wicked character of all the English," Golding writes, apparently trying to make a distinction between "good" and "evil" here. "We are to assume that there is no other sort of English except the 'bad English'… But perhaps they are good, for the people are happy." Golding then goes on to describe some of those individuals with some real violence – which, obviously, is what evil has been all about throughout human history. I suppose it's possible to read Golding's book as a sort of fantasy novel, but it also seems to me it's just a lot of stuff about a lot of very bad people, and they are, as we have come to expect from Golding, very angry people. (They are also quite bloody.) It would be great to say that this is a novel of redemption – after all, the book opens in an almost apocalyptic way, with a "great catastrophe" and a "war of Armageddon" – and that Golding's main concern throughout the entire thing is to make his characters more sympathetic, but I honestly doubt that's what he was getting at. I think he was basically just trying to get some perspective about the nature of violence and evil, and what can be done to stop it. "We are taught what is evil and what is good in the schools," Golding writes near the end, "but we do not learn what is evil…" Advertisement I do wonder though, if it's possible in our world, with today's technology and knowledge, that some of these things could be different than they have been in the past. I wonder what would have happened had someone not decided that "killing and lying" was more important than "humanity and tolerance"? I wonder if people would be more willing to forgive if people understood why they felt the way they did. I wonder if our understanding would grow if, when a young woman kills her husband, she says, after the fact, "Maybe I wasn't strong enough," or if a doctor says that when he sees a patient "there are some things we just have to put behind us" – if, say, we were more willing to listen and to forgive our friends and loved ones for their mistakes than just to blame them. It seems like a pretty obvious thing to say in 2015, but I bet it's an alien concept to people in 1600 or 1800. Advertisement [via The Guardian] Via Boing Boing.	0

Roughly half of Americans do not feel safe at work or with friends; 43% report being fearful of "violent or serious crime." The survey by the American National Election Studies found that 61% of adults have suffered some type of mental health problem, and half report that they know someone else that feels they have suffered from a mental illness. In America today, if people cannot access mental health care, then many will not access the medical treatment they need until they are in a worse state of mental health for themselves than they were when they were first diagnosed. Because of this, it has become increasingly important within the medical field to develop solutions that can help people who have mental health problems access appropriate and effective care. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) addresses this problem by establishing new guidelines for the care of people with mental health problems. However, these guidelines are not designed to address the full spectrum of the treatment that people with mental health problems require in order for them to get and remain well. Therefore, the goal of the National Service to Prevent Suicide project is to create a set of guidelines that will help physicians and health care systems create more appropriate care. The project is being led by the National Research Council, a private, nonprofit, and nonpartisan body that advises the US government on matters of government policy and scientific research. The project is the result of a partnership between the American National University and the Harvard Medical School. This project offers several unique resources to researchers interested in exploring the relationship between mental health and work and social support, and how these issues influence health behavior. Project website: www.nsppsych.org  Project Summary: The National Service to Prevent Suicide (National Suicide Prevention Lifeline) provides the following resources to help individuals experiencing depression, anger, hopelessness, thoughts of suicide, or suicidal ideation: National Suicide Prevention Lifeline: 1-800-273-TALK (8255) National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is a toll-free national phone and text service that offers immediate crisis intervention and crisis counseling to anyone 18 years or older who may be feeling suicidal, feels trapped by an immediate crisis situation, fears a suicide attempt, or is concerned for friends or family. The Lifeline was established to enhance the quality of life for individuals throughout the United States and is especially designed to connect people in need with local mental health care. The Depression, Anxiety, and Suicide (DAS) Study: DAS is a longitudinal study of the impact of the national Depression, Anxiety, and Suicide (DAS) Study on suicidal ideation, depression, functioning, and health outcomes among Americans aged 18–24. DAS is conducted by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). More information at http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/das/index.html  The National Study of Youth Risk Behavior (NSYRB): NSYRB provides comprehensive national data on youths' risk behaviors with the goal of decreasing risk in communities and preventing future suicide. NSYRB collects this data through in-depth interviews with school-aged youth by trained peer-researchers to identify risk factors—including family environments (including whether parents or other relatives view, treat, or support teens), the physical environment of a community (e.g., the presence of playgrounds and schools) and neighborhood conditions (e.g., the presence of gangs, gangs as neighbors and neighbors, the presence of gangs near or in school and neighborhoods, and peer-rated risk behaviors)—as well as their individual outcomes, specifically their suicidal ideation, feelings of hopelessness, and suicide attempts. All participants who had had a suicide attempt in the past or in the last 60 days are included in the NSYRB study. More information at http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/pdf/nsyrb.pdf	0

Praise be to Allaah. In fiqh some scholars are of the view that one should say "there is no taharah for the one who does what is haraam, even though there are many blessings of Allaah on whoever does that. Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: There is no blame on anyone who does a wrong action, and there is no harm on that person when he repents. Rather, the one who repents may see a blessing on himself after repenting. End quote from Irwa' al-Mufrad (2/285) and Tuhfat al-Akhlaar (5/286). He (may Allaah have mercy on him) also said: This was confirmed by al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar who said in Kitab al-Maghazi (4/185): the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: "The person who repents (after doing something that is a sin) will see the fruits of that in his life, and he will be blessed with that (good) fortune."[i] There is a difference in views whether the one who repents of this action will see a blessing therefrom or not, and this must be investigated for fiqh, because some of the scholars are of the view that it is not appropriate for the one who repents to say "There is no taharah" when he repents of it, because this is a concession and an excuse offered by the one who repents, and no such thing is possible, except that he will not go astray from the right path or be defeated. And we know the Shaytaan can be defeated with him, and in most cases he knows well what to do. Thus if he repents of it, then his path will certainly be straightened, and he will be shielded from the evils that come upon him. But if he is defeated, he will have to face the trials that come to people who sin. This point is confirmed in Saheeh Muslim (4/637) and it was also revealed in Saheeh Muslim (5/5536) and in Saheeh Muslim (5/6525) regarding the person who sinned, in both of which the person who repents was warned, and so that person did not go astray, and there is no sin on that person. This is also the view of Abu Haneefah (may Allaah have mercy on him) in his Sunan, in which he says: The one who repents after doing an action that is a sin, will not go astray, while if there is a sin and he does not repent (of it), it means that he has transgressed, but if he does not do what is wrong, then this is not a sin. End quote from Tareekh Al-Khateeb Fataawa 'ala al-Fiqhiyyah (30/7). The one who repents of the wrong action is not to be blamed or shamed after his repentance is complete. Shaykh Ibn 'Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) was asked: 1) I have heard that the one who repents is not to be blamed or shamed after his repentance by others, or by the one who says to him: "Shame upon you. Repent! It was good news to you." Is it permissible to say to him that what he has done was a serious sin by itself and that he should repent until it is forgotten and he will not do it again, but not do anything wrong after he has done the wrong but not before? 2) I have also heard that the one who repents of the wrong action is not to be blamed or shamed after his repentance, or when he says: "This is a very serious matter. Repent!" Is it permissible to say to him that whatever he has done was a sin by itself, until it is forgotten and he no longer does it? Forbid: What he repents of will be forgotten and the evil done by him will be forgotten because Allaah will not keep what is done until it is forgotten, but the sin will remain from the one who did that action to the one who repents of doing it. Allaah has put it in His Book to seek forgiveness of Allaah, and we hope for His forgiveness. You should pray on behalf of one who repents in order to seek forgiveness for him, because this is a noble deed. And Allah knows best.	0
By By Paul Iddon Jun 5, 2013 in Environment A Chinese fisherman rescued a group of four humpback whales that washed ashore in the eastern province of Zhejiang. According to local reports, more than 700 whales were discovered stranded in Zhejiang's Xishuangbanna city just last month. The rescued animals had been spotted in the waters off of a man-made island that apparently was being put to use as a sea wall. When the whales were found, the fishing boat driver of the group attempted to get them on board, but was also reportedly grabbed. Local reports said the fisherman was forced to swim to shore after the whales grabbed him. Local media said that some locals then caught up to the fisherman and asked him to come down from the island, but the fisherman reportedly became belligerent and refused. The boat also reportedly lost control and capsized. The fishermen then managed to swim to shore and were eventually retrieved by a local police station which is said to have taken action quickly. Local media reports stated that the rescue operation took about an hour while the whales remained on shore. The local fishing vessels were reportedly also alerted and arrived at the scene to offer help. The rescued animals were then taken aboard for rehabilitation. According to The whale found this weekend in the waters around a Chinese island had to be taken by boat because it swam on land, it has been claimed.According to Zheng Jiulin, an official at the Zhejiang Conservation and Research Center, more than 700 whales were found stranded in Zhejiang's Xishuangbanna city just last month.The rescued animals had been spotted in the waters off of a man-made island that apparently was being put to use as a sea wall.

I want to play a game with you, I want to play our game, I want you and I alone to choose what happens next, to decide if and how it is you will live again. You have the power.  The only thing that will stop you is you.  Choose the game. Your choices and actions will alter the game.  Choose your path. The path you take matters As does your future, so do your choices and actions.  Choose your path and the world will change.  Choose your path and the game is ours to play. ...And the one to play?  I just realized I need more words!  No. I am afraid that the words are all the world can provide. I want you to stop. I love you, but not this way. I want you to think of a way to bring us together.  We've been looking for a way back together and we've found it...  The game is now open. We are not yet ready to play, still. A few things I want to clear up:  This is my first game. This is the first game that I have ever made, and that I think I should ever make. I'm an artist. This game is not for everyone. I make videogames, and they are designed for a few things: fun, fast, and often very dirty. This game is designed for those people.  I want to use whatever artistic talent I have, to make this game as fun and exciting as I can. My games are not, by nature, perfect, so I expect ours to be, too. As in reality.  A few other things:  I am an atheist. I am a fan of science fiction, horror, and other things that can be thought of as the dark side of everything. I'm not much of a painter. I have no desire to be a rock star. I'm currently trying to live and work full time so I can finish this game. We're an indie game development collective. I am not paid for this game. I am being paid for it. And finally... the title of this game is "I will live through your choices." Yes. Your choices. I will live through them.	0
CAMERA ARSENAL: There are no questions that the world is changing. It's certainly true that there's less of it. But the world is changing. It is changing at a far more rapid rate — about ten to twenty-times as fast at a minimum — than was generally imagined in the 18thcentury. So if we're really going to be ready for all of the stuff we know we're going to be facing in the far future, it's going to take a lot more than a new generation of rockets. We don't need, nor do we have, the technological expertise for a return to the rockets of the 1960s. And even if we could launch them all again they would need to be much bigger than the first ones, with many more times the capacity. So how do we get the world ready for it — which is to say, for all of the stuff that's not like the rockets of the 1960s. And I think we're about ready for it. Here's what I think the world needs to do: 1) It needs to have more and better computers, on every continent. The Internet now reaches around the globe, with most nations now having computers of some variety. The question then is: to what extent will the Internet and the computers that power it grow at the same rate. And the answer to that question is: very likely at a rate that far surpasses our projections. A single computer today makes far more information available than all the computers ever made in the history of the world. How will you get everybody using the Internet with less than half a per cent of the world's computers, computers of the kind that we're talking about? You can't. The question at this point ought to be: what will be the effect of this rapid doubling of the availability of our most important information technology? It will be a truly revolutionary effect, and will change the world in profound ways in ways that few of us have ever imagined. 2) It needs to have computers able to learn. This is a bit of a surprise. After all, the first computers were made to program themselves. A lot of people thought I was going through puberty when I started with computers. But I've always thought that you learn by doing. If I were a good programmer I wouldn't be here. If I were a good musician I wouldn't be playing the piano, I'd be teaching. If I could write good software code, not that anybody understands programming, but if I could write good software code for other people to write, I think that would be enough to get by. I've discovered since then that actually learning computer programming is not the primary purpose of a computer. Its primary purpose is understanding how computers work. And the key to understanding how computers work is getting a lot of people to pay attention to how computers work. Now, there are two ways to do this. You can make a computer that understands it all — that will always know everything. This is a dream of pretty much everybody and pretty much all the time. But you could never hope to do this. The reality of our planet is that it is always changing. You can't stop a new asteroid from hitting it, or stop a change in the temperature of a region of the earth (the climate) from getting worse. You need computers that understand what's happening around them. The first computer to start doing this was one built by Alan Turing, a British mathematician, back in the 1940s. It was not a particularly good computer, because it ran at about 8th (or 2nd) rate of the best computers of that era. But it was a very early computer. It gave us a little more understanding of our planet's atmosphere, as well as giving us a small taste of the way computers might work some day. After World War II Turing got together two of his old computer friends — Alan Kay and Bill Joy — and they formed a company and built a better and better computer. It's a bit hard to say exactly how this second computer started working, because so much came later. But we know that after working on the "Turing Machine," their computers had a way of recognizing patterns that other computers could not. A good example of this is the way computers work in their search engines. For example, Wikipedia is a search engine. It's not a search engine, in the way we use the word, in the conventional sense. But what it does is it looks up the information it needs in a huge volume of data. And that data is, at least as much as anyone can tell, written in code, in the computer code that runs it. So Wikipedia is looking up the Internet. When the Turing machine was constructed, when Turing was working on it, the way it searched the data	0

See, e.g., People v. Schumacher, 45 Ill. App. 3d 834, 839, 249 N.E.2d 962, 965, cert. denied, 355 U.S. 931, 78 S. Ct. 537, 2 L. Ed. 2d 552 (1957); 1 Hastings, Sexuality: An Illustrated Guide (1941), supra, n. 3; Bowers v. Hardwick, 478 Mass. 753, 762-763, 473 N.E.2d 1261, 1275 (1986); 1 N. Y. Crim. Crim. L. § 1.15(3) (McMillan 1969); People v. Rizzo, 38 Cal. 2d 805, 805, 189 P.2d 681, 683, cert. denied, 342 U.S. 822, 72 S. Ct. 1105, 96 L. Ed. 1494 (1952).] The State argues that the provision is valid as applied to certain persons between 18 and 21 because it is not an offense against the person which has a substantial societal importance, as an attempt by a minor to obtain an obscene publication. People v. Hargus, 63 Cal. 2d 743, 748, 180 P.2d 1010, 1011 (1962). However, the Court of Appeal has repeatedly held that it is only those "intimate areas of life and conduct within the control of parents and adults" which constitute private matter which are not within the scope of an offense against the person. People v. Hargus, 63 Cal.2d at 748, 180 P.2d 1010; People v. Schmeling, 50 Cal. 2d 798, 800, 145 P.2d 456, 459 (1941); People v. Schoenek, 52 Cal. 2d 434, 442-443, 144 P.2d 1164, 1166-1167 (1939). While those areas are undoubtedly highly important to society as a whole, as these areas are traditionally regarded by the American people as the area of private, family life where privacy and individual responsibility flourish as a counter balance to the pressures of modern public life, the intrusion into such areas by public authorities and law enforcement officials is no greater than is necessary in order to maintain order. Even with the exception of those persons charged with offenses against the person, the public officials and law enforcement authorities have constitutional authority to regulate the behavior of such persons within "the area of private life" which is within the legitimate concern of the public authorities. In addition, for the most part, the public has a legitimate interest in the regulation of adult persons' private activities in such areas for the purpose of preserving the orderly and safe functioning of the society or for the prevention of criminal activity by such persons. The right to freedom of expression is a personal right from the individual's point of view, but it is a universal right which belongs to every citizen of this civilization. We also agree with the Court of Appeal that the offense against the person provision is a denial of due process of law by providing that the provisions shall not apply where the publication was for the purpose of teaching the morals of lawful sexual conduct. In that case, the defendant was charged with violating section 261 for making an obscene publication, but the court decided that the obscenity provision was unconstitutional because it provided a different standard of justification for obscenity than was provided for obscenity of general type. The case did not deal with the question whether the Legislature has an inherent right to impose such requirements on public officials and law enforcement officers. It is apparent that the court in Hargus was in agreement with this court and found that the legislative scheme for regulating obscene publications was a valid exercise of its police power under the state constitution if that scheme was reasonably related to the important governmental policy to prevent children from being exposed to adult material. While the record indicates that the legislature intended to provide public officials and law enforcement officers with an adequate means to regulate pornography which, despite all efforts of the persons involved to discourage	0
In a new effort to curb what is perceived as an excessive number of children being vaccinated, the City of Berkeley passed legislation Wednesday to implement an "underage vaccination exemption" policy for students, but only to the degree allowed by California law. Councilwoman Kate Harrison, who introduced the measure, said there should be some parental discretion as the city deals with an increasing number of unvaccinated children. As of June 1, 49 of the city's 73 elementary schools had no children fully vaccinated, Harrison said. The bill, AB 375, was unanimously approved in a 9-0 vote, the first time an ordinance has been introduced to address how children — and their families, in particular — should be affected by state law. Vaccination exemptions Under state law, students who have reached a certain age and parental consent should be allowed to sign a form indicating they do not wish to be fully immunized against preventable diseases. But parents need not sign a form to exempt children from school, according to city spokesman Dan Mogulof. There is an exemption for religious reasons and for medical reasons that are not related to immunization. "There's an exemption form that can be signed by a parent, but it can't really go much further," Mogulof said. Under state law, parents can opt to not vaccinate kids who are not fully vaccinated. Under state law, parents can opt to not vaccinate kids who are not fully vaccinated. "All kids should be fully vaccinated," Harrison said, adding that parents can also choose not to send their children to the elementary school. "It really depends on the parent and the child," Harrison said. "I just think it's a good idea to give parents that option." In her new legislation, Harrison said parents may opt to let their children opt out of the state-mandated vaccination requirements. "This ordinance is intended just to give parents more wiggle room," Moulton said, when asked if the parents have the power to make their children opt out. "It's our opinion that the law is not being enforced consistently." The exemption for medical reasons is for "medical indications that involve the prevention or treatment of the health of the child. The law only applies to immunization requirements for kids up to age two unless otherwise specified by the California Department of Public Health," a department spokesperson said in a Jan. 15 letter to Councilwoman Margarette Mondragon. Underage exemptions A second bill, AB 511 — also unanimously approved — expands the law to give parents the flexibility to let their children opt out of immunization at school, according to Harrison, who said this is needed because the district is currently trying "to reach out and ensure that all students can be safely immunized." Harrison said the City Council will discuss the second bill at its Jan. 21 meeting. "This bill has been brought up by a lot of parents, both parents of kids (who are) at school — including my own daughter," Harrison said. Mixed reaction Under her legislation, Harrison also seeks to increase financial aid and increase the number of full-time teacher assistants by giving parents that option as well. Councilwoman Kate Harrison introduced the legislation to give students greater choice about vaccinations.

Mogulof said he was not aware of any complaints about any unvaccinated students within the city limits. "This is not going to impact our kids at all," he said. "My understanding is that the local vaccination district is working really hard to make sure that they are vaccinating kids as quickly and safely as possible, as a matter of routine in their communities." In California, children have to be at least two years of age to be fully vaccinated. According to the California Department of Public Health, there are 23 vaccine-preventable diseases: 21 communicable diseases and five noncommunicable diseases. All communicable diseases need a specific vaccine for people of certain age groups, including: chicken pox, measles, mumps, rubella, polio and varicella (chicken pox). All noncommunicable diseases, such	0
A few days ago, we were lucky enough to catch up with some of the game's developers at Gamescom 2014. The team behind the sci-fi strategy game, No Man's Sky, gave us a sneak peak into the procedurally generated, space adventure. For this interview, we've managed to get the team's creative director Sean Murray a quick peek at the upcoming game's early development, and what he's already expecting from the project. During the interview, we get to find out the basics about the game, what we can look forward to most in the near future, and our opinion on how players can expect to spend their time when not playing the game.	0

A team of researchers led by the University of Arizona has uncovered a previously overlooked link between the immune system and the ability to perceive visual input. It could open up new avenues for developing more effective treatments for autoimmune diseases and neurological disorders, the team said. The research was published online in Science on May 27. The other authors were Zhen-Yan Chen, a visiting scholar at UA's Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences; Jiao-Li Li, the department's first author; and Zhongwei Zhou, the department faculty member and study co-author from the University of Pittsburgh School of Dentistry. The study was focused on an underlying biochemical protein that controls the activity of a part of the immune system called the T-cell receptor. When the protein is disrupted, T cells, a type of white blood cell, attack other cells in the body, causing inflammation. People who are predisposed to autoimmune diseases and are predisposed to neurological disorders are more likely to have a defective T-cell receptor, the team noted. They then set out to investigate whether this defect was linked with the ability to identify colors and patterns. When people are exposed only to black-and-white images, they have a tendency to forget what color the image is, the team found. However, when they are shown two different pictures: a black-and-white image with green dots and one with red dots, the subjects are able to identify which color and which pattern is occurring, the team found. The researchers further determined that such patients had impaired color and pattern perception. The scientists were able to identify the underlying cause of impaired color and pattern perception by identifying specific neurons in the visual cortex in the mouse's eye, that respond to light. They were also able to stimulate the neurons in a living mouse brain and observe the results via optogenetics, the same gene expression approach that the researchers used. They found that when the researchers stimulated the neurons with light, the subjects were shown a sequence of alternating green and red dots. In contrast, when the team stimulated any other neuron in the visual cortex the mice did not recognize the color or pattern and did not show any of the desired behaviors. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, they also observed that the neurons that control colored perception are highly active in the prefrontal cortex — another brain region which is highly active during visual processing. "We have discovered for the first time that impaired color and pattern recognition in humans is linked to the dysfunction of the T-cell receptor in the prefrontal cortex," Chen explained. "This may be an important new target to target for developing effective treatments for neurodegenerative conditions." This study illustrates the importance of studying T cells to establish the basis for diseases that involve the immune system, said Zhou, an associate professor of neuroscience and the department's first author. However, as this project was funded by the NIH's National Eye Institute, the results were not released at the time of the publication.

The New York Times is an increasingly significant part of Rupert Murdoch's empire. But in a long interview with the paper's executive editor Dean Baquet, The Times's editors are careful to say they can't be expected to always toe the company line. The interview focuses on the rise of Murdoch's 21st Century Fox, but the exchange also includes Baquet and Baquet's own editorial opinions, which include backing from The Times's editorial page writer Stephen Holden. Baquet says his personal politics are irrelevant to his job, and he says he does not have a "viewbook" about what journalism should write about. He also mentions that he's not currently working with his wife at the paper, with her working as White House reporter to the administration. But he says he plans to work more closely with her after he leaves at the end of January, and he makes it clear that he plans to make the paper and its journalism a higher priority.

A woman who says she was repeatedly harassed by her husband is suing his employer. (WSYX/WTTE) CALIFORNIA (CBS13) — A California woman has filed a lawsuit against her husband's employer for not doing more to save her life. Kira Lantz says that on December 24, 2015 while she visited the doctor, her husband David began repeatedly masturbating and assaulting her. Her doctor called police after the couple was seen "kissing all over each other," according to the lawsuit. The doctors determined Kira was in a life-threatening state and the couple's marriage was in jeopardy. Kira says as a result of the abuse, she had three major surgeries in December, 2015 because she had lost too much blood. She was admitted to the hospital on November 19 after her husband was called to the home and told she was unconscious because she wasn't breathing. When police arrived, David admitted the abuse began in April of 2015 when his wife began complaining about back pain. On August 6, 2015, she complained that she was tired, but he told her to rest because he'd been cleaning her car, according to the lawsuit. Police say on March 23, 2016 their daughter called police about noise and her father "made a disparaging remark and then pushed her back and hit her on the side of her head while she was on the ground." Kira says she was sent to Children's Hospital after their daughter complained about a bloody diaper. On August 22, 2016, she told doctors in their final note that she was afraid he would hurt her again, but he replied he did it "with affection," which is a violation of the court order. According to the lawsuit, David has been terminated from his job and he was in jail awaiting custody negotiations for her and her daughter. He allegedly told her, "You're a piece of sh*t," during a confrontation at a local restaurant at one point in October 2016. Kira claims the abuse is continuing and he has threatened to "break her legs" on at least two occasions.	0
For a lot of years, the name "the Simpsons" simply referred to the animated television show, but now it's beginning to refer to an actual book. Just a couple of short years after the release of The Simpsons Movie, and just a few short years after the release of the animated television series, the book called The Simpsons: The Complete Collection has finally become a physical object. In fact, it's so good that it's actually more entertaining than the original film. Let that fact sink in a bit: a book of the Simpsons that's better than the movie. It's one of the best things that's happened in a long, long time, folks. We're going to start by saying that this isn't the book anyone would necessarily want in their collection. While it does include everything from Bart to Homer to the whole of the Planet of the Apes, the book only contains twenty-two volumes. And this particular release doesn't really focus on all 26 seasons of the television show, as many might have guessed. So in theory, The Simpsons: The Complete Collection is also the perfect companion to The Simpsons: The Movie. Okay, that probably isn't saying a whole lot, but it probably should be, because if there's one thing that will ensure that you've always been able to enjoy the wonderful television series The Simpsons, it's being able to enjoy multiple iterations of the same book. The complete collection goes through the entire series chronologically, though it leaves out the animated television show's finale episode and the series finale episode of the animated television series. Now, what I really like about The Simpsons: The Complete Collection is that it also includes the animated television series' pilot and the animated television series' first episode, for some reason. It's actually kind of cool to get multiple sources in order, and knowing that there are additional episodes not on the collection is great, too. The Simpsons: The Complete Collection is a great book, and it's available for purchase right now. The series is also available in its original form available now on DVD. I'm glad that there is a book out there that includes all 26 seasons of the series, with the pilot and the first episode. The book even makes more sense now that we know that it's not exactly a definitive guide to every episode of the show, as we can now be sure that this was the same show that was a hit for 21 years.

I thought it would be important to take a closer look at the performance of the three most recent "high profile" players at UFC 182. Jon Jones, Glover Teixeira and Vitor Belfort were the top 3 ranked fighters at that time and all made this year's event into their most notable UFC win. Jon Jones While that was the biggest win, Jones' next two appearances as the co-main event of a card or even in the same bout should always be noted. Prior to UFC 182, Jones had never been finished in 16 years and was still regarded as the most dominant man in American MMA. For most everyone outside the UFC, Jones' first appearance on FOX would be a big moment and one of the biggest of the year. His next fight would go on to be his biggest pay-per-view of the year against Daniel Cormier. He was coming off a close decision loss in UFC 182 and the first loss in the UFC since 2007. It would be his last win in the Octagon in two years. Jones ended up getting rocked on the feet in the second round and Cormier came away with the unanimous decision win. It would end up being a record-setting fight on Fox Sports 1 after the fight ended with 20 million viewers tuned into the fight, the largest audience for a UFC Fight Night fight on a cable or network television network that night. As such, it's the most watched fight of 2015 behind UFC 189. In spite of that, Jones' performance at 182 should be considered the moment where the narrative changed: he became the man with the belt, not necessarily the best but the guy to beat. It was a performance so dominant on so many levels that almost nobody can come back from after it. After a slow start, Jones seemed to regain the confidence that had been lost with a quick submission of former heavyweight champion Vitali Klitschko at UFC on FX 8 two weeks prior. It would go on to be the most dominant performance by an undisputed champion since Michael Bisping at UFC 184 when he demolished Antonio Silva to win the belt. The question is will Jones be back? That'll be the big question. Glover Teixeira When you think of Glover's career right now you probably picture the most exciting fighter to grace the UFC since Jones. In a year where he knocked out Roy Nelson in the first round of his last fight, Glover was on a path to unifying the light heavyweight championship with a win over Chael Sonnen in September. His win over Sonnen at UFC 181 cemented the narrative: Glover is the most exciting fighter to ever compete in the UFC. On that evening, he became the UFC heavyweight champion as Chael Sonnen's title reign was vacated following his own loss. Teixeira's performance versus Sonnen at UFC 181 left us asking more questions than it answered. Can he come into Jones' rematch with a fresh mind and fresh body? Will he have the cardio to beat Jones, the ability to outbox the champion. Will he be able to do anything besides what he was capable of in the first round at Madison Square Garden? When it was over, it was clear that this guy was very much on the rise and he wasn't done there. For those who were skeptical about his ability prior to his fight against Silva, it now seems like his potential to be a star was right there in front of him. And, with the success of his last win, he now has a legitimate chance to get the title. Vitor Belfort The fight against Chael Sonnen in Brazil was no mean feat for Vitor, as it seemed even more daunting than it was in the lead-up to the fight. He made a quick turnaround to UFC 182 to face Anderson Silva, a man who was on a 14 fight winning streak in the UFC at this point. It was clear by the final day of 2013 that UFC 182 was going to be one of the most anticipated fights in years. The main event between Chael Sonnen and Anderson Silva went under the lights and was probably the best fight of the year. Silva was able to hold his own the whole night; he did what no man had ever done before in the modern era by knocking Chael Sonnen out in the second round. It was like the two were destined to fight in that moment. The crowd got louder and louder with each missed kick by Anderson Silva or missed leg kick by Chael Sonnen as their momentum grew. It wasn't until the fourth round when Silva finally was able to finish Sonnen. For most people watching it, Silva finally got his chance to "retire" on his own terms. It wasn't really clear that he wanted to retire until he did, but it was the first time since being stripped of the belt that he truly gave it his "All-Out Effort" and the fans got to see him do what he was capable of as	0
A little boy's love of "Doctor Who" has brought him to London to perform at the new Doctor Who Experience, the UK's first theme park based on the popular British show. "The new 'The Doctor Who Experience' is something really special," Paul McCartney, a member of the Beatles who performed on stage at the theme park attraction before it opened to the public last week, told The Guardian. "The kids love it. It's got a real warmth and they love it, and I think that's really important. The audience don't just have to be Doctor Who fans to like it. It can give them a different point of view." The five-story attraction houses a replica of Doctor's TARDIS, home to a "living" Doctor and a robot companion, and features exhibits in costume and with props that can be taken home for viewing. McCartney's guest appearance at the park, just two blocks from Wembley Stadium in central London, is his second in a week. On Friday, Lennon played a gig at an amphitheater outside the venue that was part of London Calling: A Concert for Africa. The show was part of the Global Citizen Festival. He also played a short show at an exhibition about the Beatles' songs and recorded music with Bob Dylan and Jeff Beck. The singer's visit to "The Doctor Who Experience" marks the second time he has paid homage to the pop music icon since the death of John Lennon last month. Lennon performed his final song, "Imagine," at a concert in New York shortly after McCartney died in New York.	0
(CNN) Police in Germany are seeking to find a 31-year-old man who was spotted on surveillance footage last month as he tried to hide from them from an unrelated burglary investigation, a police spokesman told CNN. Police have been searching for the man since the discovery of his backpack, in the same small village where a woman and two young girls were killed in a home invasion, a police spokesman told CNN. The man appeared at the beginning of November "with little clothes and a backpack and a large backpack over his shoulder," police spokesman Stefan Redlich said. The man was seen "invisible" between the hours of midnight and four a.m. with a backpack "which indicated the person was hiding from a burglary investigation," Redlich told CNN. His backpack was found early Wednesday at a train station in the village of Heilbronn near Berlin. Read More	0
This is how my last year at the University of California started: It was August. A month of fall classes before the beginning of the spring semesters. I was in my third quarter – and I was already feeling overwhelmed and lost. A freshman at the school was in my class and, like me, he was struggling to fit in. I felt awkward. I was a little more confident than him – but I wasn't quite getting there. He was my TA and his name was Ryan. He was shy, introverted, and very focused on his studies. He never really talked to me, but I still found him fascinating; he seemed to be making sense of a lot in his life. (I'm pretty sure he was having some sort of emotional crisis and he was on top of it; I was just happy to have caught him in class.) We did everything together, from study sessions to class quizzes. We were so in sync, we rarely talked to each other. But Ryan was different; he was a year older than me, and I wasn't sure about him. His first year at the school had been the worst I had ever experienced. I started doing my best to forget to care about him, ignoring his words and his actions. But one day, he started to say things that made me look at myself in a totally different way. His words were full of passion and energy. There was a great spark to every conversation, and I knew it was his passion that kept us connected throughout the day. It became more than just a friend – it was love. I'm pretty sure I was totally surprised when that love began to blossom. I remember he was in my office during a class lecture. He had been struggling for so long with academic difficulty. I didn't know what it was about his ability to focus he really enjoyed – but I wanted to find out. I wanted to be that student that Ryan admired. I wanted to be one of those exceptional students that he was reading about in his class material. How could I not think about that? During our studying sessions we always found ourselves in conversation with each other. Ryan was always very intelligent and he was always interested in learning things. As I tried getting him to share more information about himself and learn more about his personal interests, I discovered that we were both very much interested in life – which was something that I always wanted to be. At first, I started to make excuses to go out of class to hang out with my roommate, but things didn't go that well. He was so interested in his work that I could barely manage to keep up. But eventually, we both found time to come over and talk about our dreams. We both agreed we wanted to continue our studies and we talked about how we wanted to keep going. I was always excited at the prospect of my future as an academic and I had all of those same goals. But to get there, I needed to be patient. Ryan was excited and he was eager because he knew that his studying would pay off in the future. He believed that the hard work that he put in would lead to things going his way. But I wasn't sure. After talking with Ryan about his future – he was eager because his future had become a reality for him. He was now a student who had a place to live, a car to drive and an allowance to save. He told me over the phone, "Mona, I feel like I can live, so, why can't I start now?" As he was telling me this, we were outside, talking about a different topic. Suddenly, he broke the conversation off to go back inside to talk to me. He came back and was ready to share more of himself…but I didn't hear a word he said. I could hear his heart breaking, waiting for his words. Eventually, he came back outside and told me that he was worried. He wanted to come over and talk more, but I told him I needed some time, because, as he says, he wouldn't be here with me if I didn't wait for him. Ryan had given up trying to convince me in his heart that he could go back and still pursue his dream. This is the story of a young man with a dream who gave up. I'm not saying that Ryan didn't work hard his first year at the school. But at the end of the day, he put his full focus and energy into his studies – and everything else else took a back seat. When he came home for fall break, it was as if he had finally reached his destination. It was almost like he had achieved his goals of getting a degree and starting a career – and now he was just trying to save some money to make sure we had a down payment for our own	0

For a good couple of decades people have been getting their heads handed to them on social media by an angry group calling themselves "the Men's Rights Movement." The MRM is a loose collection of websites and forums that are dedicated to attacking women for all manner of alleged wrongs. The "core" of the movement is a misogynistic belief in the idea that it's inherently good for a woman to be dominated by a man, even if she's abusive or threatening. One of the most famous examples is MRA's insistence that it's perfectly normal for women to be physically and verbally raped by their boyfriends. While the idea is often presented to us as a matter of self-defense, it's far more nuanced than that. While it's perfectly reasonable for women to feel violated in some situation, these sorts of situations aren't necessarily the sort of things that merit physical punishment. Rape culture is a culture that teaches and condones rape as a legitimate form of sexual assault, and women are the ones who, by default, are the targets of that culture. The notion that they should retaliate when being physically and verbally raped is absurd. It's a little surprising that a man's rights activist would be concerned about "rape culture" when men have been using rape as a weapon against women for decades. So what is the MRM doing about this? The movement is an outgrowth of anti-feminist culture within geek culture and online. The origins of the MRA can be traced to early "manosphere" blogs and message boards, where misogynist and often explicitly antisocial behaviors were encouraged by their commenters. That culture grew out of the men's rights movement's focus on the alleged victimization of women. There's a lot of overlap with the Gamergate movement which started because of similarly "misogynist" ideas about how video games are hurting women. As many people in that movement knew full well, it was designed as a means of attacking feminist critics of gaming. That movement has grown by leaps and bounds since Gamergate started, and I would imagine it is now even more closely tied to men's rights activists. Many of the people who post on the "men's rights" pages have very strong views on how the relationship between video games and equality is a joke and should be dismantled. One of their biggest claims is that video games are inherently sexist and misogynistic. As with their ideas about feminism, they think that video games are a cultural force that women have exploited in order to gain power over men. There is a very particular strain within the male gamer population that views video games as inherently degrading and harmful to women, and the belief that video games promote a culture of rape culture is used as justification for these negative values about video games. The movement has a history of being very successful at recruiting women to their cause, despite the fact that they also attract both men and women in equal numbers. It's worth noting in this context that there are a lot of "traditional" male-dominated geek culture sites, and that many of those are now run by women who are attracted to the movement because they recognize the toxic misogynistic elements within it. There will always be misogynistic people in geek culture, but there is no denying the fact that the male-dominated geek culture (which includes the "manosphere" as a major part of that culture) has a problem with its misogyny. It must be confronted and tackled aggressively if the entire community is going to avoid further damage. However, we still need to look at this from a different angle. The problem with a subset of men within geek culture is not that they are misogynists but that they are anti-feminist. They're not anti-women, they're anti- feminism. It's this part of the male population which is the primary focus for the various "men's rights" groups that make up the movement. The men's rights movement wants nothing more than to dismantle women's rights and privilege in all forms – from work to the bedroom. That is what they will do until they have their way.	0
I've finally finished the first part (that was my goal). At this point, I've got something that is about 50% complete. The next step is to get it finished and polished. I also have some new ideas for the project, to update the game when new features are added and to try to add more content while also making it more balanced.  For the first part of the game, I've just added all the basic components of gameplay that should be present in a game. The game should have a single player and multiple modes/layers, such as multiplayer and story mode, but for now I just used the single player. The game should play as you might expect from a Mario video game, where you're trying to avoid obstacles and hit coins to beat goals which will increase your star count.  I'll keep updating as I finish the game.  As a final note, the graphics aren't really original or well drawn, but I wanted them to be simple enough to start from. I hope you can appreciate the effort I've put into them, as nothing good comes out of mediocre graphics.  Here are some screenshots:	0
There is more and more talk about why the United States isn't leading on global climate change. The new administration is moving in the opposite direction. One idea, which won't change anything in the short term but does have the potential to move the world in the correct direction, revolves around a small country that is trying to cut emissions and become less dependent on foreign fossil fuel imports. "On a scale of one to ten, the Maldives is a ten," explains Daniel Baumann of Columbia University's Earth Institute. He notes that the Maldives government has cut its emissions of carbon dioxide by 60 percent since 2000, largely in response to a 2009 law that required its citizens to reduce carbon emissions. "A couple years later, they increased them a little bit, and they've stayed there ever since," he says. Baumann's office, part of Columbia's Earth Institute's environmental program, has just published a paper based on that country's efforts to reduce its carbon emissions. Its findings will be published online this week in the journal Science Advances. For Baumann and his Columbia colleague, Robert Jackson, there is more to the story than that. "Even within the Maldives," they write, "there is a sense that the country's government and people can actually accomplish what they need to do to protect the climate, especially over the long term. The main lesson has to do with the local politics, the need for political will and political space, and the power of the people." The Maldives' experience can serve as a counterpoint to the current debate around climate change in the U.S. The study is one of a number of analyses to help put the current state of the environment in context, and to help the world's political leaders and other decision makers make better sense of what's at stake. Baumann, who is also a senior fellow at the Earth Institute, is one of the founders of that initiative, in which he serves as director. Climate change has already hit Maldives hard. Since 2012, temperatures in the country have been more than a degree Celsius higher than during the years of the 2000s global-warming peak. And the country, with small but well-developed coastline, is vulnerable to sea level rise. It is also one of the world's most densely populated islands that already hosts some of the world's most vulnerable communities—which includes many in the Maldives. "The Maldives has a very strong sense of community and identity," says Baumann, who is also the co-director of Columbia's Climate Change Institute. "It's a pretty fragile situation." The new study shows that Maldivians can make real progress if political will is maintained over time. At the same time, the country is making real progress. It has recently launched an extensive program to reduce carbon emissions by nearly 90 percent over the next 20 years. That's much more ambitious than many other countries, though there is still room for improvement. Currently, the Maldives has just about 5 percent of the world's renewable renewable energy potential, compared to 25 percent in the U.S. To be sure, carbon emissions are a big worry in the country and elsewhere, according to the authors of the study. But the authors also suggest that in the long term, a low-carbon climate-protection strategy might be more important for the future than cutting greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels. "We are much more optimistic about the potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions than the world has been led to believe," Baumann says.	0
A police officer said he has never seen a case of drunk driving that has caused such chaos and hurt as this one. A police officer said he has never seen a case of drunk driving that has caused such chaos and hurt as this one. Dublin police have appealed to people who know anyone who was involved in an incident involving a semi-automatic rifle last night at Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown Town Hall. There have been reports that a man had brought the weapon into the city centre, where he was reportedly shot dead by police. "Someone had brought the firearm to the Dún Laoghaire Garda station at approximately 8PM, the following evening," said the officer in charge. "It is believed that this is not a gun but a semi-automatic rifle. "The location is not being disclosed at this time." "It is believed that this is not a gun but a semi-automatic rifle. The location is not being disclosed at this time." The man has been shot dead by gardai It is believed the weapon had been previously used in dissident republican killings. There are a range of questions that need to be sought, the officer added. "Firstly, we are trying to establish if this firearm was not used by dissident republicans; there have been quite a number of shootings in the last couple of days and there have been fatalities," he said. "Secondly, is this a self-inflicted issue, and will the person have been under the influence of alcohol? "Thirdly, is this a case of robbery, or just a case of an individual who was in the public domain using an object which he possessed illegally? " It has been alleged that the weapon was a semi-automatic rifle and was taken from the car of a member of the PSNI in the Dala Street area. The Gardai were alerted to the incident when a call was received saying an automatic rifle had just been seen being used in an altercation on the ground floor of the Garda station. Gardai also told motorists to avoid the area. Gardai received two shots as the suspected gunman opened fire on patrol. "He was shot while the offender was on the run," said a source. "He was not wearing police uniform, he was carrying the firearm in a bag. "We expect there could be more shots." Gardaí are now searching for a man described as medium-built. They say there were witnesses to the incident and they wish to speak to them. Anyone with information who wishes to contact gardai can call the Incident Room on 1800 666111, or any Garda station.	0
(CNN) In the midst of the most intense debate ever over the nation's defense budget, President Donald Trump tweeted that he was asking the Pentagon to reduce the military's long-term readiness by 5%. In fact, he was asking the Pentagon to "get to work," according to Lt. Gen. Herbert Carlisle, head of the US Air Force. "There are a number of things that I think we could do in the short term and a number of things that I think we could do in the long term in order to both reduce our budget and have an impact that I hope will help us not just in the short term but also not only in the long term and certainly will benefit in the long term," Carlisle said. "So there's a lot of things that we could do and that's exactly what I was talking about, whether it's reducing the readiness period or some other way." But Trump insisted at a news conference in Paris alongside French President Emmanuel Macron on Thursday that he still plans to ask for a larger budget to make up for the reductions he wanted to make to the defense budget over the last seven years. Trump was in Paris to attend the Group of 20 summit. In a series of tweets, Trump wrote he was calling for a "big boost for our military," as he continues his push to slash spending and reorganize the defense budget. "The United States must greatly strengthen and expand its nuclear capability until such time as the world comes to its senses regarding nukes," Trump tweeted. "Being respectful of other countries' systems at all times is not a bad thing, but it is not smart." "United States must greatly strengthen and expand its nuclear capability until such time as the world comes to its senses regarding nukes," Trump tweeted. "Being respectful of other countries' systems at all times is not a bad thing, but it is not smart." Trump also said he and Secretary of Defense James Mattis met recently to discuss "how to get the full cost of our vast military build-up in order to be truly sustainable." Asked at the news conference if the money for the military will actually increase, Trump said, "Yes." Trump said the military will be getting the money from the Department of Defense budget, which as of 2011 was about $583 billion, including $52 billion for the Pentagon. Trump said he has spoken with the "top generals" of the Department of Defense, and that Mattis will probably report to him. He pointed to a 2013 Washington Post story that he said was very accurate, and he said that the generals were telling him this, and he said, "They don't like the numbers that they're coming in at." But in fact, Carlisle said Thursday at a Pentagon news briefing, "I can tell you that both the Secretary of Defense and the National Security Council have a very open conversation with the Department of Defense to talk about what the cost of the United States military is on the front end, and to talk about the long term." Earlier, Trump had tweeted: "I will be asking Congress to fully approve President Trump's $54 billion dollar plan for modernizing our military." I will be asking Congress to fully approve the $54 billion dollar plan for modernizing the U.S. military. #DefendU.S. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 23, 2017 He continued, "There will be many different costs involved in our tremendous military needs. But these costs will be paid for by those who truly need them. Our goal is clear: to get the cost down so we can protect our people and make our defence powerful again!" His statements to The Hill were consistent with the comments the President made in France on Thursday, where he said "the greatest threat and the greatest challenge that we face as a nation is a global threat." Trump has taken many stands in the last month, seemingly all at odds with the Republican Party's longstanding defense of the $600 billion national security budget he inherited from President Barack Obama. Trump has suggested he wants to spend more on the military. He has also called for a $110 billion increase in defense spending. Trump wants to increase non-direct military spending, such as the Coast Guard, Navy, and nuclear weapons, at a much faster rate. The President has even told his generals to come up with new ideas on how to pay for their budget increases, including cutting the State Department's budget. But Trump's plan isn't going over well with the military, according to his new White House budget chief, Mick Mulvaney. "You know, I know that that number's a number that the president likes to cite on a regular basis or once in a while. But I just haven't seen it anywhere, have you?" Mulvaney asked reporters on Sunday about the President's number. Mulvaney was speaking with reporters in the back row	0
What is the problem with being self-sufficient? Well, let's start with how we perceive success and failure and the ability to get into relationships with other people. Most of us feel like we are in a struggle. In our culture, being alone can still have a powerful psychological impact. A study conducted by the Yale School of Medicine showed that loneliness causes people to show more aggressive and antisocial behaviour in certain situations, because they feel they have to assert power over others (or "suck it up" in a derogatory quote). In the same study, people who reported being lonely were more likely to act aggressively towards colleagues and to act on their negative emotions more easily. Studies also show that the lack of friends or other relationships can cause people to become less helpful. An increase in positive and trusting relationship styles can bring people to be more helpful to each other, meaning that they can solve problems together. Research suggests that a lack of contact can even cause you to change in social behaviour. In one study, when asked to rate the importance of each of 10 social behaviours, people's social attitudes and behaviour were assessed as negative when they lived alone, but positive when living with friends or close acquaintances. People living alone, on the other hand, had a negative attitude to family, but positive attitudes to friends. They liked family, but did not interact with them much. When people have a lack of friends, they also have less chance to be involved in the life of the community around them, which is crucial in the modern world. Living in social isolation can also cause people to miss out on social encounters and friendships and can affect people's sense of self. Being a successful solo person, you will likely also lack social awareness, a crucial survival trait. The researchers at the University of British Columbia asked people with disabilities to read three stories. Participants were then shown photographs of their friends and family. Only those who were able to communicate verbally had the ability to learn from these personal pictures. While these people were not able to learn about the photos, the ability to do so helped them to build a more in-depth knowledge of their families. What was also interesting was that participants in a separate group read about the photos before watching the video, where everyone was the same. No one knew who their friends' family members were because they had no personal pictures to communicate with. They were also given a list of the words used by their friends' friends. The results showed that the words used to describe their personal photographs became more accurate as the situation improved. As we have seen, loneliness and lack of friends are closely entwined and affect each other. This is why it is important to seek relationships with people with whom we can share interests, as well as support services. Also, be aware that social isolation is a symptom that signals greater problem. Try to find out if you have these symptoms before you attempt to leave your personal world and find another one, where things are more stable. And that is it for today's post. Next week we shall be exploring the symptoms and symptoms of loneliness, as well as how being self-sufficient could improve your well-being! I want to thank my reader for making me do this!

"Caught between the Scylla and Charybdis of a rapidly collapsing economy and massive social upheaval, the leaders of the Greek government and the EU have shown an appalling inability to act in an orderly fashion. They have shown a failure to recognize the gravity of the situation." — Alexander Graf Lambsdorff, former German Chancellor, in an interview with Business Insider, April 8, 2015 "It's clear that the Greek government is paralyzed. The European Commission has no influence, but the European Central Bank does. They're trying to come up with a deal with the Greeks and they have some basic guidelines: They have to get back to the negotiating table soon, in time for a European Council meeting in December or January, and they have two choices: they can do the deal or they can let Greece leave the euro zone. If Greece leaves, Greece could be in very much trouble. If it stays in, Greece could have a very difficult time in the future and it would have to rebrand and re-enter the world economy very, very slowly, without significant amounts of borrowing." — George W. Bush, U.S. president in an interview with Bloomberg News, April 8, 2015 That's a warning from the former U.S. president and architect of the American economic experiment to the current Greek government. "Europe will not solve an issue like Greece if the leaders there are not prepared to take serious leadership. And the problem is not Greece — it's Europe." With President Barack Obama's approval ratings sitting below 42% in polls in Greece, with a growing unemployment rate of 22%, and with economic experts such as the European Commission's chief economist Martin Ravallion arguing that Greece cannot possibly be allowed to leave the euro zone, the United States' two foremost political leaders have found themselves the subjects of renewed criticism and criticism. What does it say about U.S. politicians if the former U.S. president seems unable to help steer the ship of state when faced with such an overwhelming crisis? Does it send a signal that, despite being the world's largest economy, Washington has no idea what to do when it comes to economic management? A brief history of Greek leaders to illustrate the difficulties of Washington's approach to Greece's bailout: Former Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou, elected in January 2005, had a record of managing Greece under harsh austerity. He lost the 2009 election to Alexis Tsipras, who came to power in January 2015. Papandreou's party, "Coalite for a New Era" (CoNE), had been in office for 24 years. His coalition government had been involved in a series of unpopular measures since 2010, including tax increases, pension cuts, cutbacks in social services, and reforms of national security and judiciary. Papandreou had faced repeated criticism of his management of Greece, which included the 2008 global financial crisis, an economic slowdown that was almost universally blamed on the policies of the previous government of the "Troika" in Athens — the European Central Bank, European Commission and International Monetary Fund. After the death of former prime Minister George Papandreou in April 2012, Greek voters went to the polls for a general election. Polling stations opened at 7:00 a.m. that November day and lasted into the wee hours. There were no media coverage or projections. Voters went to the voting booths with the knowledge that their country had entered a new phase of political and economic chaos, and that they had the difficult job of deciding whether the country was on the verge of civil war or the path toward democracy. Greeks came out in droves to vote in Greece's first general election since the end of World War II. In all of Greece's post-World War II elections, turnout had never exceeded 62%. The official turnout was 72%, but there was a much larger turnout of 67% of Greek males and 75% of young people. Turnout in the general election was the highest recorded in Greece's modern history. The vote was in favor of radical, anti-establishment parties, the Syriza, Podemos and the Democratic Left. The new government immediately embarked on a program to "restore public trust and confidence from the financial markets" and "to put an end to the political uncertainty that was leading to a deterioration of the economy" (as the Financial Times reported). The Greek government began cutting salaries and pensions. But before the cuts went into place, Greece's creditors, including the European Union, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund, cut all loans to Greece by the equivalent of 80% or more. Greece, still in shock from the global financial crisis, needed to borrow $27.5 billion to pay for the new spending programs. The Greek financial sector, which still had some $170 billion on its books at the time of the new austerity measures were unable to refinance and repay the new loans. So the crisis continued into 2013. Greek public spending fell by 12% in 2015 alone, bringing the amount of debt in	0

"I can't tell you," he says. "I don't want to give away any secrets. But there is a story here that's very important." He describes what he witnessed: "It's very difficult to take a photograph. It was very difficult to do this, because I couldn't get a clean picture of what was going on, you know?" "If I had a camera," he continues, "and I wanted to take a photograph, I couldn't take one right through the head. As soon as the shot starts, it starts going down. I thought, 'Oh my god, I did this to him.' It takes a second, and I realized the shot came out in an odd shape." "I was going through my bag for his clothes, and I noticed the blood on the side of the bed. I didn't even think about it, but I put his clothes in my bag. The blood still on them, and I thought, 'Oh, my god, the blood's still on his clothes.'" One of the photographers involved in Sunday's shooting says the footage he reviewed showed that Williams had not been able to see anyone on the sidewalk when he was shot. "There is no evidence that this shooting was a suicide," says Jonathan Blake, an Associated Press photographer. "It was a brutal, brutal act," he says, noting that the first two bullets to Williams's body missed, and that both victims fell on the ground. "It was a murder." This video shot by an AFP journalist shows police officers responding to the crime scene. The officer in the driver's seat had only been on the job two days, and had only been in the station at about 11:45 p.m., when he was dispatched after arriving on the scene. He was the third officer to arrive on the scene. Blake believes that Williams might have had a gun, or at least had a gun with him. In addition to the three-officer team, a third person, an elderly woman, was also called on. It took police about 45 minutes to respond to the crime scene. He adds that the man and the elderly woman were taken directly from the scene. "What was done, as far as our investigation is concerned, is as good as it gets," he says. The woman, identified as 89-year-old Delfina Mares, was also taken home at the scene, and was being interviewed by investigators yesterday. Mares told reporters that she was returning home from her yard across the street from the home where the shooting took place when she turned around and saw a man with a gun in his hand. She then ran to the area where she believed it was going to happen and confronted the man while she held it for him. "I told him, 'You are not going to do this,' " she told reporters."I asked him to put down his gun but he didn't." She added that the gun looked like a pistol but a different brand. This video shot by an AFP journalist shows police officers responding to the crime scene. The man shot, identified as 59-year-old Charles Short, was killed upon arrival at the hospital. A short time later, another man was arrested. A spokesperson for St. Louis County Police, which includes Ferguson, said that another man, 45-year-old Tyrone Harris, was detained on Friday night at a nearby auto repair shop in connection with the shooting, and charged with armed criminal action after police found a pistol on him. "I am not going to say anything else, because I'm the prosecutor and there's a process. We're going through court tomorrow, and I'm going to be involved with the legal aspects of the case," says Ferguson prosecutor Bob McCulloch. "But to me, the bottom line is this: This is a murder weapon. ... No matter what the circumstances are, if you have an assault weapon as an assault weapon and it is designed for that purpose, you can kill somebody." "If I was in this office, and I saw a man with a gun or someone who was carrying a gun, who looked like a threat to me, and we were responding to some call, I certainly would have tried to subdue and detain that person." The prosecutor is preparing for a grand jury meeting on August 16 and 23, at which time he'll decide whether or not to bring charges against anyone involved in the shooting. "They can indict a cop," he adds. "It's an indictment of a lack of respect for the law." Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson is due before the grand jury on August 15. This week, Jackson promised that the department would release the name of the officer who shot the suspects in order to show the public the officer's character. "I'm prepared to make that announcement	0
The world is slowly starting to wake up to how big of a problem climate change has become. The UN has called for a "moral and political awakening" by the 21st century, while the World Bank has predicted that global warming could cause more than 6 million premature deaths by the end of the century. However, it doesn't look like we are going to make much of a difference. The UN is getting more and more desperate as they can't take the situation any longer and are calling to do something about it. Climate Scientists Warn Of 'Risky' And 'Highly Dangerous' Effects Of Global Warming At a meeting about 'the future of the human race', hosted by the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, former US President, Jimmy Carter, warns that climate change is the most threatening to humanity. He says that if we don't stop this now, more people will die. As it turns out he isn't the first person to warn of this effect. In 2009, NASA's top climate scientist said that with climate change, "the likelihood of one person's life being destroyed by a category 5 hurricane could quadruple, by 2100." If that's the case, then we are definitely not going to stop this anytime soon. There's even a group of NASA scientists who are calling for an 'extreme weather' warning system (that's what it sounds like – a system where people can alert about extreme weather conditions). On top of that, there will be a lot of severe weather conditions in the future. One of these could even be "category 5," or even a Category 6. The UN's chief of peacekeeping mission for the Balkans, Nicholas Haysom, gave his own warning earlier this year saying that the Balkans region is highly susceptible to climate change because of its harsh weather and natural disasters. On top of this, the UN is trying their best to prevent it. In the last few years they've been trying to find a way to create a global agreement on keeping global warming under 2°C. However, this year the climate group agreed to do it through individual nations, rather than trying to reach an international agreement. Global Warming May Cause More Than 6 Million Delayed Menses By 2100 One of the reasons why we aren't likely to stop climate change is because it's happening all around us now. Sooner or later, climate change is going to reach a critical point. We are already seeing more and more extreme weather events as our planet warms due to global warming. Some estimates suggest that global warming could cause more than 6 million women in the northern hemisphere to postpone their periods throughout their life. Unfortunately for those women, some of the more severe weather events can disrupt their menstrual cycles, causing them to get stuck in a state of amenorrhea.	0
A new law would allow the state to seize and destroy firearms used by the Texas terrorist who shot up a Prophet Muhammad cartoon contest in Texas, according to new documents obtained by Breitbart News. Texas Governor Greg Abbott signed the bill on Monday afternoon, according to the Texas Tribune. The new law is similar to a law passed in April by the Pennsylvania legislature. The new law would allow the Texas Attorney General to seize firearms if the person involved in a crime poses "a significant risk of violence" or is a "fugitive from justice." The act of terrorism would be considered an aggravating circumstance in the application of the law to seize a firearm. The new law also expands the definition of who could be designated as a "fugitive from justice." Under the new law, anyone can now be placed in the state's custody if they are a "person who has been discharged from the custody of the U.S. Armed Forces as a result of a dishonorable discharge, any felony conviction, or juvenile arrest related to domestic violence or crimes of violence, or who has been convicted in any other jurisdiction of an offense that, if committed in Texas, would constitute a felony." The new law also adds two new circumstances where firearms can be seized. Federal law already allows the government to seize an individual's firearms as part of a criminal investigation, even if that individual is alleged to have no connection to the violent act. Breitbart News reported in April on a separate Texas law which allows the state to seize firearms without an indictment. One of the primary purposes of this law is to allow state bureaucrats to destroy firearms that are not wanted in a firearm control situation. On Saturday, a shooter with apparent ties to the Muslim Brotherhood attempted to hold the Prophet Muhammad cartoon contest in Garland, Texas. The event would have been held in an open-air gallery, and the shooters apparently had other motives. One of the gunmen who shot up the event had posted online statements espousing support for Al Qaeda, ISIS, and other Islamist extremist groups, Breitbart News reported at the time. Texas State Senator Glenn Hegar (R-Katy) was also among the legislators who fought vigorously in favor of the law. Hegar's push for the new law drew fire from other lawmakers, who argued that the move would actually increase the number of weapons falling under the State's control. At least one Republican lawmaker, State Senator David Simpson (R-Longview), spoke out against the attempt by Hegar to push the new law through, Breitbart reported. Simpson told the Texas Tribune, "I'm not in favor of giving the government authority to tell me I cannot own a gun. I disagree with that," adding, "It's not about gun control, it's about gun control if they feel like there are too many guns under the gun." Simpson is part of a group of state senators who fought to protect the gun industry by ensuring their manufacturers' profits never hit the state budget. The new law would help to protect businesses by making it easier to protect their own product lines. The Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one.	0
Tottenham Hotspur striker Harry Kane has been named the Barclays Player of the Month for October. The 24-year-old scored 10 goals to power Spurs to fourth place in the Premier League table and a third consecutive win - all under Mauricio Pochettino. His 10 Premier League goals have made him the ninth highest goal scorer in the competition, behind City strikers Sergio Aguero (20) and Gabriel Jesus (14). But it is Kane's exploits against Watford in the Premier League on Tuesday evening that has made headlines. It was a tale of two goals, as he missed a good chance before shooting too high from a tight angle for David Nugent to palm away from close range. But then, with his side two goals behind, he grabbed his side's third goal with a lovely dinked finish against the Hornets. His six goals in October means he is now just one behind Manchester United's Manchester City captain Vincent Kompany, who also had six goals in the league. Harry Kane became the ninth different Premier League player to win Player of the Month award (last player to win it was Chelsea striker Didier Drogba - May 2006) Spurs' five victories in October - including a 3-1 win over Everton - has seen Kane come of age this season Harry Kane became the ninth different Premier League player to win Player of the Month award (last player to win it was Chelsea striker Didier Drogba - May 2006) Kane has scored two league goals in three successive Premier League games after getting just two Premier League goals in his last 14 games (also Oct 2013)	0
If you want the fastest possible way to move your mouse, you'd think it would be the one that's most accurate. But it turns out that some mice—especially those used by gamers—are getting much faster than your average mouse, thanks to technologies that can track more than one point at once. An Intel researcher, who's been quietly working on a similar project that's been known about for some time, has presented a paper at the Usenix Security conference. His invention is called Multi-Point Motion Tracking and it's the subject of a demo in this year's DARPA Cyber Grand Challenge. MPMT can track multiple points in real time with up to five feet of separation, says Craig Williams, the researcher who's led the effort. That means you can, in effect, track multiple objects in a virtual space without sacrificing quality performance. "What we're trying to achieve is a way to have a single point that is tracked for an extended period of time [and] to achieve an accurate and repeatable motion tracking in the virtual environment," said Williams. "What we can do in this demonstration is get a point-to-point motion tracking that covers a very large distance by having the same point-to-point motion tracking in more than five feet, but in a space that is very small." As a result, Williams says MPMT can be used to achieve better precision or even, in the near future, give a virtual avatar the ability to "walk" on a surface. And that kind of power might just be what's needed to turn gaming into a reality. Intel worked with a number of experts in the field to ensure the accuracy of the technology, Williams says. One of the key challenges in achieving this was reducing the error inherent in tracking multiple points at the same time. For example when a shooter moves from point A to point B, what matters is where they end up, not what they do to end up there. The way to do that is to keep track of the position of each of the individual points of action, in addition to keeping track of where every single one of those points intersects with an object. And you can make all sorts of things happen in a three-dimensional space: The key to this is to be able to have objects that are different in color, size and even texture. Using multiple points to keep track of that variety is another challenge, but one that will be overcome if the technology works the way Intel says it will, Williams said. He's already shown off some examples of how this technology might be used in the future. "If all the points in the environment are the same color, it's no problem in three dimensions and I can point to those points. It's the texture and color and size differences that I'm having difficulty with in those environments," he said, adding, "We did some very basic computer vision based modeling and actually a very simple tracking. We could not capture that information and that's where the work has come from." Williams, who's been working on his research for the past three years, has some ideas how his technology might eventually be used. The first is to make a device like the Microsoft Kinect for Xbox that would allow gamers to control and move an in-game avatar physically in real space, without having to use a mouse to track multiple points at the same time. He's also working on a device that he's calling the Multi-Point Sensory System that could be used to track multiple body parts at the same time. "One of the challenges that we faced in this project was that the tracking speed needed to be sufficient and to track more than one point at the same time we needed to have the ability to use motion sensors in a very high degree of accuracy," explained Williams. "So right now the MPMT tracking can only track one point per motion sensor. But I think there is a big opportunity to explore how many extra sensors can be used, how much accuracy can be provided, how many spatial configurations can be established, and using those sensors in three dimensions we may be able to provide very high resolution, very high accuracy tracking that is actually able to track many more things at the same time than a standard tracking device." Intel plans to reveal more details soon about Multi-Point Motion Tracking and other related technologies that might become part of the future of gaming, Williams says. "I think in terms of the games that we'll be designing for gaming, I think the future of gaming is going to be a combination of what people call virtual reality and augmented reality," Williams said. "The reality here is that in virtual reality the player can't move their body. You might think about putting on a glove or a hat or putting on a headset, but you can't really move your body." "So the reality here is that in virtual reality the player can't move their body." Craig Williams, lead researcher on MPMT 	0

Singer and songwriter John Legend has released a short statement on the Harvey Weinstein scandal. After a long silence regarding Weinstein throughout 2016, the Oscar-winning actor took to Instagram to address allegations against the powerful Hollywood producer. I've got to add my voice to the chorus of people that are saying enough is enough. People that should know but haven't. I'd like to thank everyone for standing by me and supporting me. Legend has taken to Twitter to release his first few tweets regarding Weinstein since the news broke this week. The actor says that those who were silent all along need to speak out about the allegations. This should have been a warning sign. Instead, people are ignoring, defending and enabling a predator. My heart breaks for those women. #metoo — John Legend (@johnlegend) October 8, 2017 I have a deep respect for all women and their courage as they speak out.

A new survey claims that more and more women are now using the app to find long-term romantic matches. It comes as a survey claimed more and more female members are using the dating app dating apps to find love The survey, from OkCupid, says the number of female users of Match.com has also increased in the last five years. It found that the most popular matches are for women aged 25-34. The survey also claims that most users are using apps as a way to 'do things with people they find interesting'. The report also claims that men were more likely to use the app to 'connect' with women - but they are also more likely to use the app as a 'partnership tool'. OkCupid told MailOnline: 'Women and men are finding different things attractive in the world, and they're coming up with new ways to find them. 'So there is definitely a need for these tools, and we believe that's also why they are still growing despite all the great apps available.' The report claims that the most popular matches are for women aged 25-34 (pictured in a profile picture) The study also claims that more and more female users are using the dating app dating apps to find love. It is shown here a selfie taken of a woman, with the caption 'We Found Each Other!' The survey claims that men were more likely to use the app to 'connect' with women - but they are also more likely to use the app as a 'partnership tool' Match.com chief marketing officer and senior vice president of Match Technology, Andrew Mason, said at OkCupid's investor day yesterday: 'The number of members is increasing year-over-year, but it will take time for that to translate into a larger market. 'We believe that for a few decades, we'll see more and more women using the app, but maybe not on the same scale as other apps like Tinder. 'Men have had more success than women in using apps with a high number of active users, and we believe it's because these apps are all designed for the same kind of user – that's for users with high frequency needs. 'We know that the majority of OkCupid users are female, we feel that that's important - and we feel that the majority of those female users are very active.' The survey claims that the most popular matches are for women aged 25-34 (pictured in a profile picture) The report also claims that most users are using apps as a way to 'do things with people they find interesting'. Pictured, a profile picture on Match.com Despite that, he claims it is important to remember that the user numbers are much higher for men than women, and that male users have a greater need to connect with people, which is where Tinder differs from its male-dominated counterparts. OkCupid has 6.2 million monthly active users and 7 million monthly unique visitors. The survey found the most common phrases used by users were 'I really like you', 'I really like you', and 'I really like you'. The survey also claims dating sites 'aren't a good place for meeting people' (pictured), despite them having more than half a million members. The survey found the most common phrases used by users are 'I really like you', 'I really like you', and 'I really like you' Meanwhile, it found that the most popular dating site was Tinder, followed by Match, eHarmony, and Singles. On eHarmony and Singles, which are based around the UK, men were more likely to use the app as a way to meet a long-term partner, while on the other dating sites, it's women who are more likely to use the apps to find love.

I've got a lot to say about this book but I do think I'll start with one sentence from the back cover… You are about to enter the amazing world of The Book of Life. If you are an American and do not know at least a little about the amazing world of Kabbalah or have no idea what Kabbalah is this book is for you! But I think this book is a good read for anyone! The book begins with the idea that the entire world is "a book", every person has a "book", everyone is "out there". The book is the "big" and "small" worlds, each person's book has a special purpose, and each book has a special "meaning". This book is the "Book of Life". Each person's book is like the universe, and each book is like a person, and each person's book is like the sun. This is something that the author has brought to his art from his experience growing up in this world where everything is "in a book". The book world is the idea of the book, and everyone in it is there to help you learn about them. This book is full of stories from many different areas of the world about people, places, and things that will give you new insight into the world you live in. I was really surprised by some of them but my favorite one was about the first time I saw Buddha before we were in his monastery. He did not look like an average human being but I knew right then and there that he was something different, something special. I know of many people who have never seen him before but this particular one did and they know something magical about him. Many of the stories are centered around Kabbalah, Judaism, and magic and Kabbalah is a special way of looking at a very different part of our lives. It involves the inner workings of creation, the soul, nature, consciousness, angels, spirits, and the nature of creation itself. This book is so different than other books I have read about Kabbalah. Every story is different. One story can relate to another story, this one does not or there are times when it relates to another story in a new way but does not do so in a different way. One story might be about a particular place, another about specific people, or it might be about other aspects of the universe. This book can make a difference in the things people focus on or don't focus on in my opinion because it is not something that is easily categorized. You could say that what this book offers is an "inner journey" or inner learning which I really appreciated that this book does not fall into the genre that I would call a "religious book" and doesn't follow the rules for many religious books I have read. You can read this book on your own time but you are sure to find it informative if not enlightening. I felt like I didn't know anything about the topic of Kabbalah but the books after this one gave me an even deeper understanding. I know we are living in a culture that thinks about spirituality like we do with religion and Kabbalah has a lot of things that we can read about and absorb. The whole world is full of wisdom and the world is our book. I was really shocked at one of the stories that I was surprised by. It is about a man who is born blind. He is born with a severe eye disease when he is eight weeks old. His vision becomes impaired and he cannot see more than 10 feet ahead of him. He feels like he has a mind of its own but he cannot do anything about it, and he does not know how to explain it to others (until the day when he finds out he has a son who can see all around him. When his son is born his eyes are miraculously healed without surgery). One of the main things that attracted me to this book was the way that Kabbalah relates to the person who is blind. It shows how a person's mind can change through the miracle of God. It seems so unbelievable that this could really happen, but we can see in a child, even if he cannot see any farther than his hands, that God may be able to heal a person's blindness and allow the blind individual to do amazing things. I found this amazing book to be very educational. There wasn't so much in terms of language that was difficult to learn; I just read what seemed like the book itself, and I think that it did a good job of making me think about things in my own life and how I thought I had to change. It also really got to me and made me think. I was not really familiar with the book but it showed me things about the world about which I was already more familiar but I also learned things about myself that have never made it into my brain. I think The Book	0
The first thing that I can say about this review is that I am not very impressed by it. To start off, my experience with GQ is largely limited to online shopping. On the days I did do physical purchases I was fairly surprised with how bad of a job they seem to do. With that said, let's move on to the actual review of the product. Packaging: When opening the container I noticed that it came sealed. The whole thing was packed up nicely and the box had a pretty cool design on it. The top part of the box gave me the look of a giant pair of sunglasses, which I thought was pretty cool. I didn't really see a reason to open the bottle though, because of the obvious flaws I found in the product. So I left it on the shelf to get a closer look at the bottle itself. The bottle itself looks a good bit different than my usual sunglasses, I wouldn't say that it's completely different, but it has a unique look to it. It also feels pretty nice and well constructed. The main feature that makes the bottle different than a standard sunglasses is that it feels like a pair of sunglasses for everyday use. For someone who wears glasses on a daily basis, this would be great to help them look decent without compromising the quality of their prescription lenses. That being said, the lens itself wasn't going to be much of an improvement over my existing eyeshadows. It isn't going to give them an extra 3 or 4mm for one. When opening up the tube it's easy to see that there aren't any instructions inside. No printed writing to tell you if you have applied it correctly. That being said it is quite obvious how to properly apply it. You have to use a dampened sponge to dab off the top and bottom of your eyeshadow with some sort of misting consistency and then you run it through. I applied and followed the label directions to a tee. The results were nice and they didn't seem to look too patchy in the tube, but there were areas where it looked patchy. I did find that, overall, that the coverage was alright. I know that this eyeshadow has the words "luminous" and "rich" stamped on it, but the coverage was not really that impressive. On my arm, it didn't really reach all the way to the crease. I think that I would have liked it to have done better due to my dark circles at the time. It was still ok, but it may have to do with my under eye bags. Performance: Packaging: 4.5/10 This product is pretty solid. It has some nice packaging, it comes with a nice glossy, clear top that looks a bit like a pair of shades and does not look as though it will be damaged in transit. The product is sealed in a pretty standard plastic tube. There isn't a lot of product to go around, which is kind of a shame. The tubes are small, so they're not going to last too long in general. The application of the shade was fairly easy though and did not require a lot of effort. There could have been a bit more product in the tubes because of it, but even so I think that's a tiny bit of a pity. Application: 9.5/10 Overall I think that this eyeshadow is a good product. It is a bit on the thicker side, but does offer quite a bit of coverage. When you blend this shade it does not come out of your eyes as patchy as one would like them to, but it will appear patchy in a way that may be noticeable if you apply the right amount. The formula on these eyeshadows is a combination of really good pigmentation, as well as a natural shimmer to it. You can see the natural shimmer more clearly than the pigments are. While the glitter is a bit noticeable when blended out, it is not as bad as it was in the tube. It's more of a very subtle touch than something you would notice when you're looking in a mirror. The coverage is great however and I wouldn't call it patchy. The overall application goes fairly smoothly. It seems like I can do a good job with this product if I use a lot of effort in blending it out. It's a bit of a pain with these more sheer shades as you need to go down in the intensity of the shimmer and get better coverage. As expected, it didn't do too well on my dark circles and my eye area actually looked a bit patchy during application the best I could judge. So I think that blending it out is definitely a better option. The texture however isn't anything to write home about. It's a bit like a gel, but a gel that's probably not going to stick to the skin very well and that feels and smells a bit like the inside of a perfume bottle	0
If you go to any American music festival, chances are you'll find someone in a homemade bib, as they are called, singing from the crowd. If such a performer turns up during a festival in Belgium, however, it's not their fault; they are literally performing from the crowd. A team of international musicians formed at the same time as the festival, who have been called the bib-bearers. They form their part of their project through a process called 'bibbeating'. This means they run down the festival grounds yelling their songs to get people to join them. They make their presence known before the final bands play. They use their body and voice to give a clear message to the crowd, and to keep their audience awake and thinking. Bibbearers are so popular the festival organisers have had to adapt, allowing them to sing from the crowd too. The team, which have been travelling the world, make their presence known earlier in their performance to get the crowd as inked with the words 'we've been together for 24 hours'. At the end, the final band performs in front of the bib bearers, who hold a massive sign to the crowd. At this festival, the bib bearers were given a big stage and the team held a sign that read 'we sang 24 hours' in the middle of the stage. This allowed the bib bearers to come full circle, coming to the end of their performance and giving the audience an even clearer message - that they were really in the same band, as they all had 24 hours together at the same time. It was a perfect end to a perfect show. Bibbearers are not all about the songs though. The bib bearers are also known for singing messages from the audience. A bib bearer at this one in New York, for example, sang this message of solidarity "We will get through this". It is also not the first time they have performed at the same festival - they have performed at festivals in Austria, Canada, Germany, Japan, and the United States. They also hold their own shows during festivals in these countries.	0
A day after the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) officially confirmed Russia has applied to join the treaty-based treaty-making bodies, India, India on Monday announced it will support Russian application to join the WIPO. © REUTERS / Sergey Ilnitsky Russia's UN Diplomacy a Big Success - Putin WIPO's General Council is expected to set a date for the vote. While it hasn't been formally agreed, the move will see Russia, a country which has historically been an ally of India, becoming a member of the treaty-based international organisations. "India has always supported Russia in its efforts to strengthen international law. We believe that joining the World Intellectual Property Organisation will improve our bilateral relations. India will support Russia's application and look forward to further expanding mutual cooperation," Minister of State (Independent Charge) for Commerce & Industry Nirmala Sitharaman said as reported by IANS. The move comes soon after Russia's diplomatic mission in India said that India's support for the move would "bring about positive outcomes" for international law and development. The treaty-based WTO, which is made up of 34 member countries and China, which itself is a signatory of the treaty, has been at loggerheads with the United States, which is not a member, over the way it interprets international trade norms. The dispute arose after U.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman in 2011 told the WIPO's members that the United States was not seeking to replace WTO membership but would work to expand its participation, with the aim of creating a more level playing field between countries. On that count, India has also stood by Russia. "We take note of the U.S. administration's official statement in favor of WTO membership for Russia. This should help to pave the way for the future development of WIPO. India-Russia cooperation and cooperation in the WTO will definitely help us to further our development," India's Deputy Minister of State (Independent Charge) for Trade, Satellite Services and Shipping, K.T. Mohanty said in a statement.	0
For the past three years, the Federal Reserve has used an interest rate of just 0.25 percent to fund financial companies that do business in the US. Most of this money has gone into buying assets — essentially, US government bonds — that are bought and sold by hedge funds, private equity companies, and other money market speculators. But in July, President Barack Obama used his executive authority to change how the Fed lends to financial companies. The Fed's $85 billion-a-month fund would pay interest only on deposits (i.e. savings accounts) that are made in the fund. The Federal Reserve's two million member banks will no longer have access to the fund and will not get the Fed's interest payments to be used for lending services. Banks will get only a fraction of their deposits through the new interest rate for their deposits. It's a huge blow to the US banking system, that's for sure. It's a shame that the bank bailout, or financial derivatives reform, is not an immediate priority for the White House. It's a shame that in an era of austerity, the Obama administration is forcing the private sector to subsidize an entire industry that generates jobs for some of the poorest people in America. But is this the real problem? Or do the actions of the president matter more? Banks have been trying for years to get rid of the fed funds rate as a way to make it cheaper for them to make loans. This is partly a result of the Fed's efforts to keep rates low — to ensure that it doesn't force banks to make risky loans that might blow up. But in addition, it has become increasingly clear that there is only one way banks make loans: by creating credit. These loans are then used to buy assets — usually commercial real estate. For banks, this is a big payoff — it means that if they want to maintain control of the American economy, they need to control the US credit market. The idea was that by making commercial real estate more difficult to buy, banks would have less incentive to make risky loans to new borrowers. But the Fed is now cutting off the supply of funds that banks can create. The Fed's action has a large impact on asset prices. People who can't get deposits are worried and sell off their stocks and bonds. This pushes the prices up, and those who can now afford stocks and real estate see their values go up. But everyone else (who can afford to hold cash, as well as other assets) sees prices fall — causing them to sell off their stocks as well. So the Fed is making a huge difference in how the American economy functions. But it is also making a huge difference in the amount of wealth the American middle class receives through their savings accounts. The Fed's action is forcing bank depositors and bank shareholders to start to worry, and these financial market players will decide that it's time to hold off on a big purchase. Their fears are justified: the Fed's recent actions are pushing US stocks lower. There is certainly a case that the Federal Reserve should do more. Banks don't need a rate of interest for a few months of credit to fund their operations. As we've written, the Fed doesn't have to set the interest rate below the natural rate of interest; it simply decides to do so when it believes that inflation is low enough. And in the long run, if the US central bank does raise interest rates, financial investors will adjust. What's happening now may not get fixed as quickly as the Fed would like, but it's not the end of the world. And it may not be the end of the economy. But there will come a point where the Fed has to decide whether it wants to support an economy that is losing more than 5 million Americans each month and is being decimated by job loss. Is it worth forcing the American worker to carry financial debt he doesn't need if there is some chance that his job will be lost tomorrow? Is it worth using inflation (which the Fed doesn't want to do because it would force it to raise rates) as an excuse to cut rates if wages are stagnant and workers are losing their jobs? And for this reason, a lot of economic policy wonks are saying that it's time for the Fed to raise rates.	0
The most famous (and hated) of British monarchs by all but a handful of his subjects, George III was an imposing figure, one of only three British male Heads of State (along with George IV and James VI) until the birth of Queen Elizabeth II in 1952. Born in 1757 to a wealthy British family, George III believed he was destined to follow in the footsteps of his father in politics and government. His mother died in childbirth, and he was soon sent to the prestigious East India Company School where he studied military strategy under Admiral Lord Nelson. Upon leaving the British military, when he was 22, he traveled to the American colonies, where he learned to grow and smoke tobacco, and to be an expert in navigation. ADVERTISEMENT Thanks for watching! Visit Website In 1780, at the age of 26, he was elected king's adviser on ships (a position which saw him spend hours studying maps and surveying for naval engagements), then, in 1786, he was made second in charge of the East India Company. In 1789 he married Elizabeth Mountbatten, the wealthy daughter of Lord Mountbatten, the head of the British government, and they had six sons between 1789 and 1792; George III grew up with his two younger brothers, William III (1791–1814), and George IV (1793–1860), both of whom would grow to rule the British realm from their grandfather's position as king. As the son of two monarchs, George III was heir apparent, and he proved himself as a great and ambitious administrator. He founded the House of Hanover in 1791, the first foreign power to reside in the royal capital of London, and made sure the new kingdom could afford both a royal palace and the most advanced naval fleets in Europe. A favorite son, he won the public's goodwill by establishing a system of state religion, encouraging British immigrants to become citizens, building the first public library in the British Isles, and establishing the modern British postal service. He was also a great patron of art, design, sports, dancing, and drama, and his son and grandsons became prominent members of all three of these fields. George III had several mistresses, two of whom, including the first English woman painter, John Constable, became popular celebrities. When his elder son Prince George, only fourteen at the time, was killed in a duel by a member of the American revolutionaries in 1781, George III was widely condemned for his role in what many historians now regard as a foolish and unnecessary battle. Still, when he died in 1799, his kingdom seemed secure. He was succeeded by his grandson, King George IV and his favorite son, George V, which made the era known as the 'Golden Age' of the British monarch. ADVERTISEMENT Thanks for watching!

The following is a guest post by James Meehan, who is the CEO of the National Catholic Reporter and the editor, along with Tom De Wever, of the Catholic News Service. In an op-ed published on April 12th, The Wall Street Journal's Bret Stephens attacked Pope Francis' advocacy of "the idea of mercy." He called, "one of the pope's most controversial views, mercy, is being undermined in the Catholic Church—by the leaders of its hierarchy, and, for that matter, by the church's own bishops." To explain and amplify my argument for why mercy was important in the life of Jesus, I have come here to offer the following reflections on his words. I have chosen to use the same phrase used by St. Francis of Assisi in the Sermon on the Mount to describe Jesus in Revelation, "God's Goodness manifested." I have used both the Latin word for mercy and the English word "mercy" because both have historical origin as the English translation of the Latin word, merce, which appears in several well-known biblical texts, but especially in Leviticus, where it is used in the Hebrew Bible, the New Testament, and the Book of Revelation from the Catholic Church. This usage comes to us from the Greek word, kataki. While the Hebrew word for it is in the singular, while the Latin is in the plural. Kataki means "the offering of God for our sins" [1] and when translated correctly, both are the same word. In the Greek and Latin, a verb must be found to translate the word, though. The translators of Revelation have not simply translated the word kataki for mercy—they have changed the meaning of the word itself. Jesus Christ is the offering, merchein katakyon, which in Greek means the offering, mercy of God. Christ is the one who offers mercy for us, his only begotten Son, to offer us the fullness of God. The Word of God is "that mercy, the which God hath before ordained, to be received by faith. [2]" That mercy is indeed given, not of men, but rather by God. It is God himself that gives mercy, who is mercy itself, "who also quickeneth [katakos] the dead, and calleth to the things which are above, even him that sitteth upon the throne, who is in heaven" (Rev. 3:17). God has not only "mercy" for his people, but mercy for all men. This is the mercy of God revealed in his only begotten Son. The word merciful, in Greek, means "loving." A mercy for an instant but a merciful God over time. "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life." [3] In this passage of Scripture, Jesus is calling God, who is merciful, a loving Father. What is the Church's attitude toward the word of God? This scripture describes it. And he told them, "I am the voice of one sent forth from the Father, with the words 'Go, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,' and teaching them that they may be blessed. [4] As if to say, "What has been given to Father does not belong to your children until they are born." The Church has a special and different relationship with the mercy of God. To be merciful means to be loving. We must, therefore, be merciful toward our church through love and the teachings we share. In the early church, even as they spoke of God as a Father who gave himself in love for all men, they expressed a strong sense of justice for them. "O how richly they are, but how unjustly impoverished!" [5] They held the Church to be "our Mother, Who for us men and women, who for us Christ's Body, is our Mother" (Mt. 10:4). Today, however, we hear a similar call from St. Francis when he says we should "be merciful to everyone, just as a merciful Father loves the children he has given and not the people he has given them to." [6] That does not mean to be indifferent to the sins of others—on the contrary, it means to love them, to "be kind to all men." What is the Church's attitude toward the mercy of God? The Catholic Church has not only a special relationship with the mercy of God—it is the mercy itself. "It is not the man who is most directly merciful, but God who is most directly merciful. And in His own way God is	0
You know how in a romantic comedy, the bride and her suitors arrive in the middle of the night to surprise the groomsman, just in time to be woken up by the sounds and smells of his bed? In a post-apocalyptic world, these same characters would probably arrive to welcome a certain someone they're in love with, while she's away. A couple in Russia took to Facebook to inform their Facebook friends that they'd arrived at their destination at dawn because the weather's perfect. The event has since been dubbed the "Sleeping Beauty" problem after the image of a princess and her husband coming to a sleeping beauty's rescue.  Advertisement The idea for the joke began when a couple in the Russian city of Ulan-Ude shared the image on their Facebook page. Although it's technically a joke, the photo has since been viewed more than 13,000 times, and in less than three days, it's gone viral. The joke isn't going unnoticed, however. The photo was also picked up by other social media outlets, like The Daily Dot and The Huffington Post, but has also been shared on a variety of forums and forums around the web. Advertisement This new type of post-apocalyptic romance is a very weird thing to have a lot of followers for, as you'd expect. Some users are also not in on the joke.	0
The White House on Monday was asked to respond to President Barack Obama's claim in his weekly radio and news magazine address that America needs to "rebuild" its military before it's too late to prevent another 9/11-style attack. Obama, who was in California this weekend for a Democratic fundraiser, discussed his new proposals for curbing gun violence following last month's terrorist attacks in Paris that killed 129 people along with French President Francois Hollande. In the address — broadcast on Friday — Obama also blasted the Republican-controlled Congress, arguing at one point that "it cannot be that some of our military, some of our most precious resources, are not even being used to keep us safe." "We're not allowed to kill people any longer because we don't want to kill people. We have to rebuild our military," Obama said in the address. "We haven't used the military to keep us safe. We have to rebuild it." He added the following statement: If we're serious about defending ourselves and our allies, we've got to do more to support local law enforcement, and ensure they have the tools they need to investigate, disrupt and catch violent terrorists before they strike. White House press secretary Josh Earnest responded Monday to Obama's statement. "I don't know where the president was going with that particular piece of rhetoric," Earnest said. "I think it would be helpful if we had it laid out for him, or if someone could give him an update as to what was actually being done by the military, given to local law enforcement, as to what it's looking like and what kind of threat there actually is from ISIL and from other extremist elements." Earnest said the president was simply talking about the cost of war in terms of lost lives. "You heard the president talk about how he wants to restore our military capabilities, and I think he's exactly correct. It's not because he thinks that military capabilities are always necessary," Earnest said. "I think a little bit of context is needed. When he talks about the costs of fighting and preventing another terrorist attack, he's not talking about just military costs. He's talking about the costs of having those kinds of attacks happening anywhere, anywhere in the world." The Obama administration has been taking a cautious approach to the Islamic State group as it continues to lose territory to the fighters. The group's territory in Iraq has shrunk to less than 50 miles from the capital Baghdad, and a United Nations report released in August said that ISIS's leaders have abandoned their Iraqi stronghold because of attacks mounted by the Iraqi government. Obama did, however, warn the group, which has also claimed the attack in Paris on the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo, about "the dangers of terrorism." "We will not be intimidated or dissuaded by despicable attempts to target innocents. We will stop you. Period," Obama said on Friday at the end of his speech in San Francisco. "The entire American government is working as hard as we can to protect the American people. And we will continue to do it." Fox News' Jennifer Griffin, Bill Mears and The Associated Press contributed to this report.	0
This is part two of one interview with former Vice President Joe Biden. In the first part of this interview, published January 15, Vice President Biden talked about his decision to step out of the 2016 presidential race. This interview, published today, is a follow-up to our first one, published November 11, 2016. Presidential historian Arthur Schlesinger Jr. said in 1992: "In politics of any kind, there comes a moment when the party has gone too far the other way." This time, it's no wonder Democrats and former President Barack Obama are facing significant internal pressure in the Democratic Party to distance themselves from former vice president Joe Biden, now a U.S. senator from Delaware. That being said, there are some significant reasons not to distance the left from Biden. Indeed, if Biden were ever to run for president, he would likely run in the Democratic primary. While we still prefer Clinton as the candidate of the left in this election, this might actually serve Democratic interests for the party. The current Democratic Party leadership will not make a "Joe Biden" candidacy possible—and if they did, it would not be a very good sign for the party. In order to defeat Donald Trump, Democratic leaders will need to keep as much distance as possible so that they would have a way to take him down after the election in 2020. Therefore, the current Democratic leaders need a strong and charismatic candidate to take on Trump, and a guy like Biden might be this candidate. For his part, Biden still sees a way to reach out to Trump's base and win with these issues. His most important message is not just about Trump, but about an America-first economic policy centered on free trade. "If you have a president willing to say to the people who he doesn't know who 'you're going to be left standing after I'm gone,' that's a pretty powerful message," he told the Wall Street Journal. This would be a key part of how Biden's presidency would succeed, not just in rebranding the right and the Democratic Party from Hillary Clinton to Bernie Sanders to Elizabeth Warren, but in showing the country that change is still possible. But as the former vice president said "There's an enormous amount of anger [among] white working-class voters that has to be managed and harnessed. A large role that I see myself playing is taking that anger out to where it's about jobs." Biden will go up against the Democratic Party establishment on his left, who have largely aligned behind Clinton and, according to a Politico/Morning Consult polling report, are more "likely than not" to oppose his candidacy. In addition, Biden will go up against former President Barack Obama, who seems uninterested in running for his former job, which may be in part why he's making no effort at rebranding after the 2016 elections. Nevertheless, Biden is one of the most popular Democrats in the country, is a popular speaker, and he's just gotten some new momentum in his reelection bid in Delaware. His endorsement by the former Massachusetts Governor and fellow Democrat, and longtime party member and former United Nations Ambassador, Deval Patrick, has proven very popular, and as a result there are many Democrats who are interested in finding a way to keep Biden in the fold. That being said, the current state of the Democratic Party means there may not be a real chance for Biden to win the nomination, but he might not be out of the game for long if he were to run. What does Biden want to do in the United States political scene once he retired? There's definitely some overlap in his priorities when he ran for the U.S. Senate against incumbent Richard Blumenthal, for the New Hampshire seat. Both Biden and Blumenthal are also big supporters of the American Health Care Act, which could give them some clout within the Democratic Party should Biden decide to run for president someday.	0
A group headed by U.S. billionaire businessman and Republican megadonor Charles Koch wants to influence the 2016 campaign by promoting a pro-free market message, particularly to younger voters, according to documents filed with the Federal Election Commission. A memo from one of the group's top officials to other top officials, filed Friday with the FEC, lays out a policy of "economic freedom agenda" for future campaigns. The initiative is a nod to the Koch's own economic freedom policy, which has led the donor network's political operation to develop a more centrist strategy in recent years. It could be a signal that the libertarian wing of the conservative movement is poised to take on higher-profile roles in national politics. The group, called Freedom Partners, is headed by senior vice-presidential candidate Tim Phillips, who was recently appointed by Koch to be president of Americans for Prosperity-Florida, a super PAC that's spent much of the past decade on the state and national stage. The plan appears to be part of a broader push under the Trump administration to bring conservative ideology under the direct control of Republicans, as the GOP tries to regain its footing and regain voter support after its failed bid to repeal the Affordable Care Act. "Trump campaigned and promised to repeal and replace ObamaCare. The public deserves a president who can deliver on that promise. The Republicans now have a chance to show the public the power of conservative principles and deliver on that promise," said Koch network vice-president for policy Marjorie Dannenfelser. The memo, signed by Phillips and distributed to Koch network officials from across the country, was first reported by Politico and The Wall Street Journal. The plan calls for the groups involved in the initiative to "create a daily campaign that will help Americans understand why the freedom agenda is the best for their families." One of its key policy objectives is the promotion of the free enterprise system, particularly for millennials. In particular, it wants to promote "economic Freedom Index scores" that measure the U.S. economy by looking at "economic freedom index rankings," "pro-growth economic policies" and "pro-market policies." The measure will be updated periodically, and will likely measure where the world's rich and poor countries stand. It also highlights the growth in the number of millionaires in the U.S. "For us, the index is a great way to understand what is happening in the world with our economy," Phillips said in an interview. "It's an objective and quantitative measure that allows us to understand which countries have the most free enterprise," he said referring to nations with low government regulations. Freedom Partners is also hoping to focus its efforts on the "right-to-work" bill, which was voted down in the Wisconsin Senate this week. Freedom Partners would support efforts to "make certain that right to work is included in any major national economic legislation," the memo says. The group intends to use the Freedom Index to build "a network of like-minded organizations and individuals who believe in economic freedom and believe it is good." "We intend to support and build this network to influence future legislation, to make sure that economic freedom is included as a principle in legislation and will advocate across the country for economic freedom," the memo says. The group has been expanding its political outreach in recent weeks and now claims more than 80 affiliates around the country. The memo goes on to say that the campaign is "focused on engaging the millennial generation and building networks." Koch network officials did not immediately respond for comment Friday.	0
The first time I heard of the U.S. "War on Drugs", it was in the context of Nixon's "reefer madness" campaign. I was living in New York in the early 1980s, and when my roommate bought a bong out of the mail, the state police raided our apartment because the drug paraphernalia was too "hardcore." I was incredulous and furious. As an African American teenager, I was also disgusted by the way young people in the hood had been targeted by the police for their music, clothes, and hair. However, as a young black male living in the Bay Area in the 1980s, I had no idea how this war — which had been raging at that moment of my life — affected me. As I grew up in New York and later in Los Angeles, I grew increasingly frustrated with the "war on drugs." It seemed hopeless — no one seemed to have the answers. As a young man, I felt that the police, the government, and all of America's institutions had failed me, and that the system was racist, classist, and homophobic. As I entered graduate school in social work, I struggled to explain why I was so troubled by the drug war. I came to the realization that the war on drugs is not just an effort to get addicts into treatment and jail. As a working class gay male, the war on drugs is also about my experience of class. On the day my father came out of the closet, my grandfather told me that being gay is a disease that affects the black men who love him, and that I am the cause of it. A week later, my father came out of the closet, and the media portrayed my father as the tragic victim of his sexuality. I was shocked at the hypocrisy, and my frustration was compounded when I discovered that my boyfriend at the time, who is White, was also gay, and this fact had no impact on the "war on drugs." To understand my anger, I spent the summer after my father's second coming out in Jamaica in 1990, where I listened to music from the 1960s and 1970s to learn about the history of Jamaican Jamaican gay culture. I learned that the Black Panthers are gay, and that homosexuality had always been viewed with fear and suspicion. I learned that the British Empire's homophobia was fueled by the fear that homosexuality will make people "fiscally more efficient," which translates to more government money. I read about the rise of the LGBT Movement in Jamaica, and the way it became the first country to legalize same-sex marriage and recognize trans rights. Jamaica became the first country to recognize same sex marriage by the 1990s, and trans people in Jamaica have never felt stigmatized or discriminated against. Jamaica's law, called the Jamaican Human Rights Act, is also the first international human rights law to specifically address discrimination on the basis of gender identity. In 2009, with the backing from the Jamaican government, the Human Rights Campaign (HRC), the most powerful LGBT organization in the United States, came to Jamaica to tour the country and engage in a series of local dialogues. The HRC's visit sparked an unprecedented discussion between LGBTQ Jamaicans, people of color, the White community, and other Jamaicans. At the end of the trip, several people called a meeting in the Queen's Club for Change in Kingston that was hosted by the Community of Jamaica. Two days of talks and discussion led to resolutions to the following issues: End discrimination against gays and lesbians within the Jamaican society. Eliminate the criminal penalty for same sex relationships. This will end the practice of "repenting the crime," where many gay and lesbian couples in Jamaica would have to face the stigma of being branded criminals. (Jamaicans currently face the threat of being executed if found guilty of "sodomy.") Criminalize consensual gay sex and human trafficking. End the stigma surrounding HIV/AIDS Progressive Laws for Men, Better Education, Better Welfare: The government of Jamaica has taken concrete steps to support gay rights. Despite a very backward legal system, gay and lesbian couples can now legally marry, and the government has implemented laws that give civil rights to transgender people. In 2009 Jamaica enacted the most progressive law regarding gender identity in the Caribbean and the Western hemispheres. This law is called the Jamaican Human Rights Act and gives protection to gender nonconforming and transgender people. The law was signed by Governor Sheila Clark, Jamaica's first openly gay female governor. The Jamaican government has also given its backing to the international Pink Dot celebration. Pink Dot is a global movement that uses Pink Dot, a beach near Singapore, to promote peace and gender equality.

LUCKNOW: The state government has started a survey on crime against women , looking at the crimes committed by men against women and whether it is a problem. The survey will be conducted within a year.The UP home department, acting on a petition from a woman journalist, had initiated the survey in August 2014, following which the state government passed an ordinance, making provisions for the study. "We will do the survey within a year, once we get some more data," said a government official. The official said it was planned to have a team of officials in each district and also a team of women in each local police station to implement the study."The survey will not only take all kinds of reports on crimes against women from the women who have come to us and reported them, but will also survey cases that were not reported. They will also collect the names of the culprits of the crimes," he added.The petition, filed by Prashant Bhushan, also said that since law and order measures by the chief minister's office had not seen any positive impact, the state government should also conduct a survey.A senior state home department official said that with Uttar Pradesh and other states having more women, there was a need to look at crime against women. "At least 10,000 rapes were reported in the past one year alone, but only 20 FIRs were registered in the past one month in the state. We want to ask what are the reasons behind the low number of police stations being constructed in the state?"The official said even though the law and order department had started several initiatives to help women at risk of crime, the police personnel are also not on the same page and this also resulted in incidents of women being attacked."Asking whether rape is a crime would be like the police asking why only four FIRs were registered in a year," said Bhushan. A lawyer, who had filed the petition, contended, "The survey will not only ask why are there fewer police stations, but also the number of such rape cases." He said the chief minister's office was taking the issue seriously and it was an attempt to create awareness among women about crime and how they need to take protection from it.	0

The state's highest court has rejected the argument by the state's attorney general that a law prohibiting transgender individuals from using public restrooms that align with their gender identity is required to comply with the U.S. Constitution. Earlier this month, Attorney General Maura Healey launched an aggressive public relations campaign urging the public and businesses to comply with Massachusetts' bathroom law, which imposes penalties of up to $500 or jail time for refusing to accommodate transgender people who seek to enter restrooms that match their gender identity. On Tuesday, Healey filed two separate lawsuits against a local grocery store chain and a woman's group seeking to invalidate the legislation. "The Massachusetts Constitution prohibits government from imposing gender-based discrimination ... on any person or business," Chief Justice Leigh Saufley wrote in one of the first two decisions rejecting the arguments from the attorney general. The state's Constitution "has been interpreted to protect against public policies that penalize private conduct," she wrote. Advertisement But in a second decision, Saufley turned down Healey's request to issue a preliminary injunction in her first suit. Get Fast Forward in your inbox: Forget yesterday's news.

Sign up for more newsletters here The women's group had made similar complaints against Healey and the attorney general's office. The group had tried unsuccessfully to force the secretary of public safety's office to stop enforcing the state's law prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sex in employment. The office agreed to stop enforcing the law against the supermarket chain and its parent corporation in a settlement reached last year. Healey's office has said the law protects women and children from sexual predators seeking private areas where they could molest them. The law was enacted after legislators heard complaints from women of what they said were a disproportionate number of reports of sexual assault in women's restrooms and dressing rooms by men who were seeking to harass them. But a judge dismissed Healey's lawsuit against the Boston chapter of the National Organization for Women, calling the attorney general's argument "ludicrous." Advertisement Judge Robert B. King said Healey's office "has never advanced a legitimate interest in this case." He declined to issue an injunction, finding that Hisaley had not met her burden to show the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on the merits of their cases. "If you're going to make the argument that this is needed to protect women, then you must have evidence that the law is necessary to protect those women," King said. "And I haven't seen anything to suggest that any of the cases that you've named to be violators should be put in a situation where they are likely to be vulnerable to harm." Healey's office has said the law protects women and children from sexual predators seeking private areas where they could molest them. The governor issued a statement calling the rulings a "victory for privacy and public safety." The attorney general is "in court trying to rewrite Massachusetts' bathroom regulations by the back door," the statement noted. David Scharfenberg can be reached at david.scharfenberg@globe.com	0

The two biggest US tech companies, Google and Facebook, have come under fire for paying "hundreds of millions" of dollars to US law-enforcement agencies, reports revealed this week. The National Security Agency and FBI are reportedly among the companies that have reportedly paid for access to people's personal data through the so-called Prism program. But Google is widely considered the most powerful of the two firms, partly because Google provides information to users on how to access the company's own services without compromising personal data. It was last month that the Guardian revealed how the government used data from the company's data centres to track the movements of tens of millions of citizens without a warrant. And after the revelations earlier in March were made, it emerged that the US National Security Agency (NSA), also known as the "Big Brother" or "Big Sister" of the US, had been paying more than $800 million (£450 million) of taxpayer money per year to a secret data-mining company, apparently exclusively working for the spy agency. The news broke last month and, thanks mostly to a leak from NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden, made the headlines. Facebook, meanwhile, paid $10 million (£6.5 million) to the NSA between 2011 and 2013 to make sure the internet giant was not targeted by terrorists because it uses its own servers to store user data. The Guardian claims the $10 million payment included an additional $2.3 million (£1.3 million) that was a "direct contribution from the US government". A separate payment of $600,000 (£386,837) in July 2012 followed the initial "contribution" that brought the total amount to $11 million (£7.4 million). But the latest reports suggest that the total figure may be much, much higher. According to the Wall Street Journal, US government agencies have come under pressure to disclose the details of the surveillance and law-enforcement agencies have also reportedly requested to spend more time in the company's data centres. "The amount they spend on these services is astonishing," one former government official said. "It's a billion-dollar industry, it's not rocket science." But while Google and Facebook are able to afford to hire more staff, the firms have come under harsh criticism after a number of scandals involving government access to data through their services. A report in 2010 revealed that the NSA used a program called Boundless Informant to track the emails of tens of millions of users across Facebook, Google and Yahoo for the agency. It also emerged that the data-mining company had conducted surveillance on private relationships between American citizens and a range of companies in order to give the spy agency insight into how to best target suspected terrorists.

In the wake of the deadly attacks in the French capital by jihadists, France's largest Muslim group has demanded an end to "hatred" but said it remained "confident" police would crack down on a rising tide of homegrown terrorism. "No one likes a terrorist, but no one can justify [terror]," said spokesman Kam el-Chantiry. He added: "We cannot allow ourselves to be driven by hate to commit attacks against people whose faces we have already seen." France, currently home to about 5 million Muslims, has suffered a series of attacks by Islamist militants this year, including suicide bombings in Paris on Friday that left 130 people dead. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Free Sign Up The violence has coincided with the arrival of tens of thousands of migrants fleeing war-ravaged Syria, with some of them heading to France, seeking asylum. Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve is expected on Friday to announce plans for tougher checks on those seeking asylum from Syria, where several jihadists are believed to have trained and fought. The group Muslim Star, which describes itself as "the largest umbrella organization of Muslims in France," said on Tuesday it was worried, but not shocked, about terrorism. The group's leader, Grand Imam Hassane Meschaoui, urged Muslims to cooperate with anti-terror forces in France. "It's obvious that it is the nature of the times, but we are certain that our brothers will continue their fight and will prevail!" he said in a statement. "France has been a target in the past of several attacks in which Muslim citizens fought at the side of terrorists," said Meschaoui, who heads the Grand Mosque of Paris (La Marseillaise). "We are also certain that we are going to face a rising tide of attacks in the near future," he added. He also said that France needed to be more discriminating in the ways it selects refugees "to ensure not only the security of [the] citizens but also the religious identity of our young people." Many Muslim groups in France have repeatedly urged authorities to be more accommodating of migrants, as well as to do more to fight Islamophobia. On Tuesday, Meschaoui also addressed a rally in support of French President Francois Hollande. "It's very painful that they are calling him an Islamist. He is not, he's a president. He has made sacrifices for every citizen in the country. He is responsible to all of us, Muslims as individuals and Muslims as a community," Meschaoui said. "He has declared jihad to save France," he said of Hollande, who has come under fire from far-right and nationalist groups for being too cozy with the Muslim community. He also addressed the issue of security. "It's very clear that we're going to face an increase in terrorist threats and that our country's security is very fragile," he said. "The war on terror doesn't just take place on the front lines. The entire world, our brothers and sisters in Syria, Iraq, Libya, Afghanistan, Cameroon, Palestine, Eritrea and Somalia all need to work harder against terrorism and we need to make sure that we're part of the solution rather than the problem." Meschaoui was speaking in support of an anti-terrorism law that would allow authorities to track and punish French citizens who travel to fight abroad to join Islamist fighters, including in Syria. The proposed law would give the authorities sweeping powers to monitor citizens and to revoke passports. The proposed legislation comes as France continues to battle its deadliest terror attacks since World War II. The attacks, claimed by the so-called Islamic State group, began late in the day on Friday with a suicide bombing at the Stade de France sports stadium. Two attacks followed within a week, the first at the office of the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo and the second in an attack on the Jewish supermarket in Paris. The French authorities identified the two suspected terrorists as radicalized French nationals, who had links to Islamic State jihadists in Syria. One of the two attackers was shot by security forces and killed. On Saturday, two assailants, one from Morocco and the other from Algeria, killed a police officer and a civilian outside the city of Montrouge and injured 11 people in a possible reprisal for Friday's attack in Paris. In the city of Tours on Sunday, about 30 people were wounded as two attackers opened firing on a police station on Thursday night, injuring four people. France has suffered over 100 terror attacks so far this year, of which 86 have been by jihadists.	0
HUNTSVILLE, Alabama – The City of Huntsville recently took the first step toward putting solar panels on its water main system. The move will eliminate nearly $3 million in operating expenses for the system and provide a new source of funding for the city's aging infrastructure. Plans for the system are estimated at $2.3 million and will bring energy to Huntsville homes and businesses, the mayor has said. That funding will pay for approximately 65 percent of the upfront costs, including installation, financing and regulatory fees, and can be used for projects within the Greater Huntsville Water Company boundary, according to an August 2 news release from the Huntsville Utilities Agency. It is important to note that the city of Huntsville still needs to obtain approval from the city council to install solar panels on utility poles. The energy generated from the system will be used to provide electricity to city buildings, said the release. The city is funding the project with $225,000 in matching funds from city utilities, the release said. The remaining $1.6 million will come from a "community development fund," the release stated. (The mayor has said he will use some of that money to start working on his city's new police headquarters.) The release also stated that city of Huntsville employees and contractors will be using panels and other equipment to keep an eye on the service lines. City utility spokesman Bill Jones said this is the city's first use of renewable energy to power municipal utility projects. He said previous projects have included solar panels on the roof of the city fire station and solar panels on the exterior of the city offices. "We've had some success at putting panels on utility poles," he said. "The next step will be to install them on the poles around the city." The city, along with the Greater Huntsville Water Company, are working together on the project, Jones said. "We're excited about it." The water main project is scheduled to be completed sometime between late June and early July, Jones added. The news release and the announcement made to the media came in Huntsville City Council's Tuesday night meeting. The topic of the meeting revolved around the city's "Sustainable Energy and Greening" plan, a long-term sustainability goals statement. According to the release: The plan is a long-term strategic vision for the City's future. It lays out a long-term vision for sustainability that will be implemented in multiple disciplines, from land-use and permitting to municipal operations and building codes to community services. The plan calls for the development of sustainable infrastructure, strategies and strategies that address and mitigate the effects of increased urbanization and rapid demographic change, such as a greater reliance on automobiles. It seeks to create a more sustainable environment for residents, businesses, the arts and the natural environment, such as by reducing reliance on solid, fossil fuel-based fuel energy sources and creating more sustainable transportation options. It also seeks to minimize the impact of the energy supply and use by all levels of city government, and will help to ensure that energy sources that benefit community members are used by the city. According to the release, the city has a goal of sourcing 90 percent of its electricity from renewable green energy sources by 2050. Currently, it sources about 20 percent of its electricity from electricity from renewable sources. But it is unclear if the new system announced Tuesday will meet that goal, Jones said. The city has long wanted to develop more renewable sources of energy to help meet energy sustainability goals, Jones said. For example, the city was able to acquire 50 acres of land south of U.S. 60 that is currently undeveloped. That land will allow the city to develop a 50 million square foot city complex. Once completed, the city will have 4,900 multifamily units from which to draw energy. The city has also discussed the possibility of converting the U.S. 60 bridge over the Mobile River into a pedestrian and bicycle access corridor, Jones said. To learn more about the new plan for the city's renewable energy portfolio, check out the announcement on the city's website, cityofhuntsville.com. The Huntsville Water Company is the city's electric utility. As a subsidiary company of the Huntsville Utilities Agency, the company has been in business since 1925 and serves approximately 35,000 customers, including approximately 7,000 in the City of Huntsville and approximately 16,000 in Madison County. The Greater Huntsville Water Company provides water and wastewater service on the City of Huntsville and Madison County boundaries in the Greater Huntsville area. It is one of the largest water and wastewater utilities in North America.	0
A Florida man who got rid of a bag full of cocaine and heroin that he thought was a Halloween decoration instead found 15 grams of meth and a half-gram of cocaine. Police found the heroin and meth while searching a car that had just passed through the Port St. Lucie area. They say 33-year-old Juan Carlos Rodriguez-Ruiz, a construction worker from Fort Pierce, was in possession of a container full of drugs in his truck. Police say this isn't a criminal case, but a drug task force operation. And they say it's not uncommon for cops to find the items in the cars of drug dealers. Port St. Lucie police say they're trying to keep the operation a little closer to home -- with patrols, at least once a week.	0
Killer whale calves on the coast of Canada's east coast have been spotted for the first time since 2015, according to a team of scientists from the British Columbia Ministry of Environment and Parks, the Canadian Wildlife Service and the University of British Columbia. The researchers released photos taken by an underwater robot called SeaX-MP-2, which operated in the waters of the Gulf of Georgia, the Gulf of Georgia Bight and the Canadian Arctic Coast. BONUS: A Giant Killer Whale Breaks Through the Waves at the Miami Beach Pier The team says that in the past six months, they've seen "some of the very rare, young black and white orcas born at an unusually young age, and they appear to have been in good health." They also say that the whales showed strong mother-calf social bonds, which "may offer insight as to why the animals' numbers are currently still declining." "The findings are important," said Dr. Michael Smith, one of the team members. "We've seen these animals at lower numbers for many years, and we need to understand just how important these orcas are to our fisheries."	0
In an article titled, "Can It Be Done?", he writes:  It's actually much easier to write the whole thing this way. Write a very small function. (At most, about one line in length.) Write a very compact method. This will make it easier for you to move the function onto a separate line. And, even better, if you're a good programmer, you'll be able to move it into a separate function or method, leaving just the method as an outermost call, so that the whole thing looks like one step. So don't try to do the whole thing this way. But if you're an advanced programmer, maybe try doing an outermost method first and then doing a step. After that you will be a lot more comfortable doing it this way. It's not difficult to understand the implications, but I was surprised by how often people write this way. (Is it because it's easier?) So I figured I should write an article explaining it, because I think this is a topic that should be explained, and because it's fun to see how it can be done wrong, but it's much more elegant to write the way you write it when you want to. OK. Lets start from the top: First, lets consider some very simple function that calculates the x% of each row and the y% of each column. Let's call this function p , where p is the x% and p^ is the y% : function p%(x, y) if x < 0 return -x elseif x > 0 return x * (1/x) / y else return 0 end We can now generate a nice table using the p% function, which can easily be found here: function p%(x, y) rows = {"A"=>2, "B"=>1.4, "C"=>.9}, cols = {"A"=>2.4, "B"=>1.25, "C"=>.3}} print "%dx: %dt", p%(x,y,1) end What I want to do now, is create a small function that takes each row and produces the corresponding column: function pcol(r1, r2) if r1 == 0 then r1 = r2 end if r1 > 0 then return row(r2, #r1) end if r2 < 0 then return col(r1, #r1) end length = pcol(:row(1,:col(1,:row(2,:col(2,:col(1,:)))))), 2) end The first thing I want to do is understand how to call the row function, even though the resulting table appears quite long. Here's how I would start with my own implementation, without knowing anything about the inner workings of row . function pcol([row_a, col_a]) p.row(row_a, col_a) end That's fine. But how do I call row that doesn't take an argument? function row(row_a, col_a) if col_a > 0 then row_a[col_a] + row_a[col_a-1] * col_a end end That might be OK, but I might as well be able to pass by value so that I could make rows just as big as my original, non-row functions. Then I come across the following code. I don't seem to be able to use an outermost call like pcol . To see why, consider a table a . b is the column in table a: table.a table.b I use the b column in my pcol call to calculate the y% column: pcol(:row(1,:col(1,:row(2,:col(1,:))))) This is certainly not the most elegant way to call row , since it has to start off with two outermost calls! The correct way to call row is actually to create a function that works as row itself, without the need to start off with three callers. The idea is to start off as a simple outermost call like pcol , then create a function for each column in table a . If you have to use the outermost call, you're probably asking for trouble. You don't need to know whether or not you can pass that argument to the inner calls, only that you can use a method on the same callable object. Let's create these inner calls now, so that we can use them in our pcol call. We first create another function called row_contents on the call to pcol with an argument for the output column: row_contents(#x) row_cont	0
Trevor Timm The year is 2011. The first-person-shooter genre, the one where you use your brain, not your guns, to take down all-comers, is booming. On the other side of the pond, Call of Duty: World at War is coming out. It's a sequel to the game that revolutionized the first-person shooter. The best shooter in history, it's still the best. In both cases, the original shooters have spawned a number of imitators, which make the original look like a bad movie. But with Call of Duty 2, the sequel to the best FPS of all time, the developers have created more than a better follow-up. They've created an evolution of the genre—a sequel to the greatest ever. The sequel to Call of Duty 2 is the year's most successful game. By any measure, it is a revolutionary blockbuster. The graphics are stunning. There are three protagonists, all unique and engaging, and their decisions affect how the game unfolds. In the space of about 20 minutes, you can experience a variety of emotions. The plot turns on the actions of a single character, but the game's narrative twists and turns so frequently (and so expertly, in comparison to other video games) that you lose track of who's the hero and who's the villain. The multiplayer is also spectacularly designed and engaging. All the different weapons make for different types of gameplay. Every multiplayer match feels like a different puzzle to solve. If a game's plot and setting are its key selling points, then Call of Duty 2 manages to sell those strengths to one's mind, body, and soul very well. The plot, by the way, is as much of an original idea as its gameplay. (That first game ended, not with victory, but with an epilogue of betrayal—and, most often, death.) This sequel keeps you guessing about who the hero is. The villain is as interesting (and as evil as ever) as the hero. And that's just the first game. Call of Duty 2 is a sprawling, multi-character tale set in the world of the First Gulf War. The characters are all memorable, which is a great accomplishment. Even the ones who don't get too much screen time get enough of it: the gruff-talking sniper that seems to know exactly when and where to shoot to kill, the silent, stoic sniper that is often the first to spot the sniper, the guy in an Israeli tank (a tank that has more guns than a Volkswagen bug). The only one we didn't see at all was the smart-mouthed computer genius, and his role was cut way, way short. It wouldn't have been surprising.	0
A group of five men are recovering from bullet wounds following a shooting Thursday on the South Side of Chicago. NBC 5's Natalie Martinez reports (Published Friday, May 21, 2015) A group of five men are recovering from bullet wounds following reports of gunshots at a barber shop at 6401 N. Sheffield Ave. in the city's North Austin neighborhood on the South Side. Officials at Advocate Illinois Mason Medical Center said all five males are in stable condition and that they were shot in the head, left shoulder and upper back. One was grazed in the head by a bullet. Chicago police detectives are investigating the shooting, which was reported at about 5:30 p.m. The men, age 16, 17, 25, 28 and 43, were walking to the shop, where all attend North Austin High School, when they were confronted by a group of men in a white car, police said. The driver, who has not been identified, pulled out a gun and began firing, striking the five men. "People were in the barber shop when they heard gunshots and a car drive by so they ran out," said one of the victims. "Everybody was crying. One of the guys that was shot had a big hole in his head." He added that the car also sped away as they walked outside the shop. The driver took off after the shooting.	0
LONDON, May 8 (Reuters) - The price of petrol and diesel prices may fall later this summer due to the high UK government subsidies given to fuel retailers, the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA) said on Thursday. A customer pays for an oil pump outside a petrol station in Harrogate March 24 last year. REUTERS/Toby Melville The U.S.-based think tank said in a report that fuel retailers will have a lower profit margin but higher revenues as subsidy costs are passed on to customers. "We expect the retail fuel price to fall by around 2.8 pounds per litre in July due to a combination of lower refinery costs and fuel subsidy costs," the report said. While prices for home heating are likely to rise following the reduction in subsidies in April 2015, the IEEFA forecast that petrol and diesel car prices will average $1.11 per litre in the summer this year, down from the $1.26/litre they were at this time last year. A report published earlier this year said the government would cut fuel duty by about 70 percent from 2020 in an effort to help drive down the price of fuel.	0
There's only one person you should worry about: yourself. That's what a new experiment out of Yale suggests. Researchers asked participants to think back on an activity in their lives, and then rate how much stress they felt from it. After doing so, the experimenters then ran a second experiment on how much stress participants felt afterward. When people gave themselves an ultimatum, they felt significantly less stress at the end. In some cases, the stress they felt was actually lowered. Meanwhile, when people forced themselves to respond on time, their stress levels spiked. That's the case for people who asked for help, too. The most severe ultimatums didn't work the best: They were followed by increased stress; in these cases, the participants ended up feeling less stressed after the ultimatum. Advertisement "The results of this experiment lend credence to the belief that ultimatums of any kind tend to have greater negative effects on the recipient, on self or on others," the researchers concluded. "Such ultimatums tend to exacerbate existing psychological problems and/or drive an increase in current psychological problems." It's important to note that this doesn't mean people were intentionally trying to cause stress. This is how psychological research works, so we don't know that in the study specifically. But the idea that taking on an ultimatum was the first step toward increasing stress and anxiety just makes sense. To give people advice on how to deal with stress (other than not taking requests), the authors recommend telling friends and lovers you'll take one last job offer (on an earlier date) before announcing if you've taken another.

Spencer Platt/Getty Images Former President Bill Clinton made headlines on Thursday morning after saying in a fundraising appeal that, since he exited the Oval Office last Friday, "everything's changed in this country." The news wasn't all positive for the current president, though; he added that he thought Trump's agenda would "destroy our country." "Trump's team's vision for our country is an impossible mission—one that will put us back 25 years on the pathway to the most unequal, most unfair economy and society in the world," Clinton said. "The people who live there deserve the things I was elected to protect and protect our nation deserves that. Everything's changed in this country since I left." Advertisement  "The election of Donald Trump has created a national emergency," Clinton added. "I will do everything I can to support our former president and work to protect the progress we've made and to make the world a better place for our kids and grandchildren, to do what I can to help him carry on that good work when he becomes president."  Bill Clinton's words were just the most obvious response to Trump's "America first" economic rhetoric. Trump campaigned for president by pledging to pull the country back from the brink of economic collapse and restore the nation's strength. He repeatedly promised to return jobs to the United States and boost Americans' wages with lower taxes and less regulation. In fact, even within Trump's own own party, there's much consensus that the best way to boost wages for American workers is to cut taxes and regulations. But that vision—of an aggressively protectionist U.S. economy—doesn't sit well with many. In the wake of the presidential election, nearly every major economist declared that it was simply untrue. Even Goldman Sachs, whose economists famously advised Hillary Clinton to take the kind of hardline positions Trump would often advance, made the argument that, even if wages are held down by reduced economic activity in the wake of the election, it wouldn't necessarily mean a recession in the near-future. "If the administration follows through on its tax and regulatory agenda and starts to put out more jobs, that would provide some comfort," said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics. "It's going to take many years to determine the long-run impact on productivity, employment and wages." There have also been concerns, though, that Trump's plan to rebuild the U.S. military by cutting funding for the Department of State and United Nations could further fuel economic tensions. Advertisement  One of Clinton's major policy proposals during the campaign was to raise the minimum wage for all Americans. This is important, in the wake of the Great Recession, because it means that, in the short term, there's more money spent around a higher wage structure. But Clinton also advocated for paid family leave and equal pay for women and racial equity, and it's possible that these positions could also be taken up in the coming years if both Democratic and Trump policies are adopted. But while we shouldn't assume that Trump's economic agenda will end in disaster, we also shouldn't dismiss Clinton's concerns about Trump's policies as trivial. We've already seen that his proposal to cut taxes doesn't exactly make sense when it comes to tax cuts, and that he's not really an advocate for free trade either. When he's looking to put his populist stamp on American values, and help the economy grow, Clinton has some concerns too.	0
Brisbane woman, 26, dies after being stabbed 16 times at her home Updated A Brisbane woman who died after being stabbed 16 times has been identified as a 26-year-old from New South Wales. Brittany Meredith from Brisbane died in hospital on Friday night after suffering a number of stab wounds to her chest and neck at her home in Fortitude Valley, Brisbane's south. An inquest has been ordered into her death, due to begin on Monday morning. Coroner Ian Gray, who has declared a public holiday over the funeral, said that Ms Meredith's father died in December 2016, when her then husband and the couple's two young children were placed in foster care in Brisbane. "It was a very difficult situation," Coroner Gray said. "No-one could have anticipated that such a devastating attack was about to occur." Ms Meredith was originally from Cairns and worked as a waitress at the River Café in Fortitude Valley. A memorial has been erected outside her family home and a memorial group has been set up on Facebook. Ms Meredith was also deeply involved in the local community and the funeral has attracted support from people in Cairns across the nation, both in an online post and in person. The service is also supported by a number of other Queensland community groups. Ms Meredith was the eldest of five children and was a single parent, with her children growing up in New South Wales with the couple's two sons. The coroner said he would be inquiring "as to what led to this horrible death". "We have a number of things happening in the police investigation," he said. "My role is to make sure all the evidence is presented and all the coronial procedures and protocols are followed. "I'll be inquiring into some of the issues in all the circumstances, but obviously this is a very, very distressing event." Fears for child's safety as family's home searched Mr Gray said the family's home in Fortitude Valley has been examined as part of the investigation into Ms Meredith's death, and police have also been seen canvassing nearby homes. He said there had been concerns about the safety of children in the area, and the coroner was considering asking the Brisbane District Council and the police to put in place stronger measures to protect vulnerable young residents, who he said may have been in the area late on a night they normally would not have been. "It may turn out that some parents could be forced to leave their children in places like this, because where the children could be is the place where the stabbing occurred, so we need to make sure children are safe," Mr Gray said. "And it may include stronger protection for vulnerable communities and vulnerable people." He said Ms Meredith was living in the same house as her young children and her husband, who was a student at Monash University in Melbourne. "Her husband is also a student at Monash University, he has been given the opportunity of moving out, but he has opted not to do that because we've had a police search of their home in the city of Brisbane," Mr Gray said. The coroner said the family did not have many possessions in their own home, so he was not aware of any plans to move. Local community and friends said the family seemed to have been in good health, and there were reports of a recent family barbecue. Police said they had no reason to believe the alleged stabbing was linked to drugs or other issues.

"The real question is, what are you going to do about it?" said Mr. Obama, who is under pressure from his political base to take on Russia. "I think we're headed in that direction." Mr. Obama said it looked as if Mr. Putin was trying to divert attention from protests in Moscow after the annexation of Crimea . "I think it is very dangerous and something that the world should be concerned about," Mr. Obama said. "That's why I think it's also absolutely essential that we try to bring all of these issues, and the challenges that they pose, together, and that's what Secretary Kerry and Dr. Verma are doing right now together." Russian officials had said no agreement was reached but the Russian Foreign Ministry later released a statement saying that in recent talks between Lavrov and Kerry on the Syrian crisis, they had agreed to start working on a plan for "effective co-ordination between the U.N. and the Syrian opposition." It added that Kerry and Lavrov will return to Russia in the coming days to discuss details on the plan, including "identifying a mechanism for monitoring, assessing and verifying activities undertaken by the Syrian opposition and the U.N.," and "creating a joint center for monitoring coordination." It also said Kerry had agreed to visit Moscow and Moscow again before April 15 for talks with Lavrov. The Syrian revolution, which began as peaceful protests last year, quickly morphed into an armed insurrection after Mr. Assad refused to cede power. The government forces in recent months have increasingly been pitted against the armed opposition fighters known as the Free Syrian Army. Those fighting Syrian security forces have sometimes been supported by the Syrian government.

On the first day Mr. Kerry left the country, British Parliament debated whether to allow him immunity like those from other countries like Syria or Libya , where his son is serving a jail sentence for plotting against the British government. One lawmaker, Mark Pritchard, said Mr. Kerry's continued travel suggested there was a "big problem" with a proposed intelligence and legal system in the Middle East. "He's going from place to place and he has all these other issues to address," Mr. Pritchard warned. While some politicians may be considering how to treat Mr. Kerry because of his involvement in the Syrian negotiations, they have stopped short of calling for his removal from his job. "What we're considering is if any of those people can become legitimate representatives, is he eligible," said the British foreign minister, William Hague . Russian officials said Mr. Kerry was in Moscow on the first day of three days of talks with Lavrov but did not respond to a request for comment about any discussions on his future. It is not clear whether Washington would seek to suspend Mr. Kerry once the Syria talks conclude. The United States and its friends believe that Mr. Kerry, a former chief negotiator for both President Bill Clinton and President George W. Bush , is one of the few diplomats they hold in high regard. In public appearances since leaving Syria last Friday, Mr. Kerry has expressed hope that talks would not be abandoned and that the United States and its allies would soon be able to work together to find a political solution. But many officials, including Mr. Kerry's Republican critics, are wary, given Mr. Kerry's strong interest in establishing dialogue with Syria's government and being seen as an honest broker. He has been working with the Syrian opposition since he returned from Syria two years ago after his son was arrested by the Syrian security services. Photo If the Syrian government continues to ignore demands for free elections, some officials in Washington say, Mr. Kerry may be asked to return to the region. On Wednesday, the Turkish Foreign Minister, Ahmet Davutoglu, said that Mr. Kerry and his Russian counterpart, Sergey V. Lavrov, agreed in Istanbul "on the need to continue efforts toward an agreement, and to continue contacts and consultations on the Syrian crisis."

"When you see it, you know it's a bad story." At some point in all these weeks, I'm sure that a journalist will ask me if, when I'm done with the book I'm working on, I'd like to do a TV version instead. I'm sure my first reaction will be, "Yes!" and I guess, yes: I really want to see how a television show from me and my co-writer and co-producer Lauren Oliver would translate to television. But I'm also certain that, whether I write it, produce it or direct it myself, I'm going to find a host of objections to any such project—a host of objections that, when we're done, have not yet been put under scrutiny. Here are the biggest of these objections, in no particular order: 1. It's about a movie. A lot of movies get adapted. I watched The Godfather five years ago. I'll admit that when I found out that Michael Corleone was actually named Marlon Brando, I thought, "Oh, my God, did anyone write a screenplay about that?!" I was right. That movie adaptation was done by someone named David Mamet. And that was a very good film. I liked it just fine. Like most Americans, I'm a little put off by the whole thing, of course, but I was at least glad that the movie wasn't about Brando, just Michael. I've seen a lot of films. And I know that for a book about a movie, it'd be a very bad idea to start telling people what the movie was about, because if you try to put Brando, Marlon Brando and the Godfather in the same sentence and get them to agree it's all one big movie, that doesn't help anyone to understand what the movie is about. It gets confusing. 2. It's about the Vietnam War, really. Oh, the War. It's just like that. When it comes to the War, no one but David Mamet and Mike Nichols, who wrote the screenplay, has much of an opinion. For instance, when it comes to the Vietnam War, there's no such thing as the "realism" of the War. They only have one version called "the War" and that's the version that the American public has been fed—and, incidentally, that's the version that the book is about. Why would a good writer take the time to write a book about a subject you know well? For what purpose? Why not spend the time to simply write the book? Because of all the objections that this is all Vietnam, of all the objections that the book is only about Vietnam—we'll get to that. 3. It's not a novel. We've all seen the movies. We know the plot. The thing that's most important in a book is the plot. The thing that's most important about a movie—and it's something you should have in mind when you're writing a book, too—is that it's not a work of art, that there's something more than entertainment in it. If you know anything about movies, you know that the first act is usually not the best part of a movie. A great movie is when you get hooked by the first act, when the story moves faster than the movie stops moving in the second act—and that's what a good story is. You can see this very neatly in a novel. Take a book that begins with a beautiful opening paragraph—"The book was being brought by an elderly lady in a wheelchair," or thereabouts. In fact, you could put the first line of nearly any novel into a screenplay: "The boy opened the book." What happens then? Most of the dialogue in that novel is meaningless—"The man looked surprised when he saw what she was carrying" or "The woman looked up at the little blue sky and smiled." This is not because there's anything more in the novel than boredom. It's because the plot is so terrible that there's nothing interesting to say while you're reading the book. It's really only the first hundred pages. There's only one reason to write a novel: not so that you can do the movie. It's important to do books—and movies—for the reason that you find interesting. So even if a screenplay about an episode of The West Wing might be a good movie, you have to resist the temptation to copy the first chapter of that book, to think that the rest can be found in this first scene. 4. The movie is in English, and you're going to have to translate it. One of the big complaints about movies is that they are just too complicated to translate and that people who love movies, just love them in English anyway so there's no reason to force them to listen	0
In August, the New York Times published a story on a mysterious new group called Global Witness, that had a reputation for exposing corporate excess. Their findings, the story stated, supported the suspicion of many that the global economic system was in tatters. By the following day, after spending just a few minutes digging into the group, the Times had called them "a fringe group that is more interested in media attention than in transparency". In fact, there were few articles about Global Witness that weren't about their corporate critics, the financial industry, or the political establishment. If there's a reason why the media is quick to denounce NGOs, it's that they have the power of the state behind it. A few dollars in their pocket from an NGO (or a billionaire) could make the difference between a newspaper article about how to get rich, or how your kids get sick. But there is a counter-narrative being pushed across countries with the help of a new organisation called the Fund for Investigative Journalism (Fij) – it's a campaign to restore the balance between government, business and civil society. It's a campaign that we can take our part in, because we are the beneficiaries of the system. By the way, the Fij website says they have a $3.7m (Dh18 million) budget, yet the list of backers is limited and a lot of this money isn't being used. The rest is going towards funding local NGOs, which provides them with new opportunities to tackle the problems, as well as the opportunity to help governments, NGOs and other interested parties solve those problems directly. Last week, the Fij invited me to join them, and the next day, I was on my way to Berlin. I was greeted by a man on a motorbike who introduced himself as Michael. He showed me around the office and gave me an overview of what Fij does. Here are five lessons I learned from Michael. 1. Funders are not stupid In the office, I met another Fij Board member, Anne Sargent, a young, attractive Frenchwoman whom I initially got along well with. For starters, she seemed to know a lot more about the problems Fij dealt with than I did. There were a couple of Fij staffers at her table, too. They looked like researchers rather than consultants, perhaps due to budget cuts, and their knowledge and experience seemed to be extensive. The Fij staffers were happy to answer any of my questions. But they also seemed to know what I had in mind and tried to steer me away from areas where I might get stuck. For instance, they wanted me to focus on what I should know about the corruption problem in Angola and Mozambique, even though the topic was on my mind already – there was nothing in the room that would have convinced me. 2. Don't trust the media: they will always be biased I met a few times with a bunch of lawyers; another Fij board member met me at the offices of the Legal Services for Sierra Leone. The latter one wanted to give me a primer on legal aid, pointing out that the Fij had helped build it out. But as I was trying to find out what it cost to use legal aid in Sierra Leone, he suddenly wanted me to stop. "No need to stop," he said, "The Fij is trying to fix that too, we can fix it together with you." I said I was interested in finding out how legal aid programs worked in Africa, not just learning the basics. I explained to him that the Fij was doing this, but we couldn't do it alone. I tried to get an answer, but I had a feeling he was avoiding the topic. The other Fij staffers didn't know what to tell me either. If I was a freelance researcher, they would have been more willing to give me some time to learn the ins and outs of legal aid, but they are public relations experts who also are trying to shape the public opinion regarding aid. It's not just the NGO they work for that is pushing them to tell the same story (see: The New York Times). 3. A lot of research goes into the media, which can get corrupted I met with reporters from the Times, and several from the Guardian, who assured me they were on my side with regards to Global Witness. I also met with local journalists who are working on the issue. When I got back home, they told me they were getting the same answers from other reporters as well, even though they had the same sources of information. In other words, the media have a lot of influence on the information that we are getting. And the information is never objective. As soon as you mention the names of the companies and the people behind them, it's all too much. For example, Global Witness investigated companies involved with the Mozambican government-owned electricity	0

Residents of the town of Doon, County Mayo, have been told they will be relocated to a temporary shelter in a rural location as the temperature falls. It is unclear whether the move is connected to the storm that is expected to hit Ireland early on Saturday. More than 100 people are said to be being offered emergency accommodation in Doon as the cold front approaches. The Co Down Telegraph reports that the move was being made by the Regional Support Services in a bid to help residents stay warm as the temperature falls. The news agency also quotes a Donegal County Council spokeswoman as saying that the move is "part of a weather alert system for all the areas in south Mayo", in relation to the anticipated temperature fall. The move is in addition to the 10,000 emergency accommodation offered by Donegal County Council so far this winter. The spokeswoman's comments were made to the Donegal Register on Tuesday morning. (Image: David Butler) Earlier this week, the State Emergency Operations Committee (SEOC) warned that extreme cold, high winds and low pressure systems are forecast to affect the north eastern parts of the country on Saturday. Gardaí have urged people to take the necessary precautions during the night, with warnings that there could be a mixture of rain and snow, especially in rural areas. This morning a large part of the Co Louth coast was closed off by a gale force wind storm. The National Ambulance Service earlier said it had recorded four medical calls for the storm. One fell victim to a fall, while another person was treated for a laceration that was not serious.	0
Bike Lanes on Broadway Street We've been hearing a lot about bike lanes on Broadway. The main street between South Lake Union and South Duwamish is one of the busiest streets in the city. Broadway runs from the waterfront southward, through Pioneer Square, to Denny Triangle. It's one of Seattle's main thoroughfares, a commercial artery. At its busiest, the street brings in 80,000 cars each weekday. Now the Seattle Department of Transportation (SDOT) is looking at expanding bike lanes by adding bike-only lanes and narrowing the streets. A recent story in the Seattle Weekly discusses the City's process for planning and design, but we still don't have any details. This is a complicated undertaking. Bike lanes are a controversial topic in Seattle. A lot of the issues we're raising are the same as issues around bicycle parking and sidewalks. And SDOT is not new to cycling. The agency has been running bike infrastructure for decades, and has been building roads and rail lines for the better part of that time. If things go smoothly, bicycle infrastructure could be in place for this summer's opening of the Fremont Bridge. Here's a map from SDOT showing the street reconstruction and expansion, and the city's long history of bike infrastructure. The SDOT website has no information about the streets on the list, other than the ones marked "conceptual," and where possible, they were used in the planning process. No one who has studied bicycle infrastructure in the city is surprised. Here's one example: On Broadway, the city plans to add a protected bike lane alongside the existing "one-way" bike lane, called the "bus right of way." The bus lane is in good condition, and the bike lane would be an obvious and good option. SDOT's plan also includes widening the two parking lanes and turning lanes on Broadway from two to four lanes, but that has not been implemented, and it's unclear how big the change would be. How SDOT Plans to Increase Safety for Cyclists SDOT does a very good job of describing the types of safety improvements that they will propose to make, but they have some vague goals: Add more cycle tracks to the busy road. SDOT notes that cyclists on Broadway have very low visibility and lack safety features such as a bike box or raised curbs (which are essential for cyclists who ride with the flow of traffic). SDOT would add bicycle signals to the bike lanes which would be activated by motorists to allow a cyclist to proceed through the intersection safely.

SDOT notes that this is one of the most urgent issues for Broadway cyclists. Bicyclists who can't see intersections (including cyclists who are walking) need to be able to signal safely during stops and turns. SDOT notes that this is one of the most urgent issues for Broadway cyclists. Bicyclists who can't see intersections (including cyclists who are walking) need to be able to signal safely during stops and turns. Extend and improve pedestrian crossings. SDOT would extend and improve the existing pedestrian crossing at East Pine to make it a safer option for bicyclists and pedestrians. The City also recently published a report on Broadway bike crashes, and found cyclists made up a good chunk of victims. SDOT's plan could go a long way toward reducing cyclist injuries. At the most basic level, bike lanes make it safer to share the road with cars. On the streets where SDOT wants to build bike lanes, there are already two-lane boulevards, making it easier for cyclists to turn left from an intersection. The city also notes that bike lanes provide a great experience for cyclists and non-cyclists. A cyclist on Broadway may see no cars, but traffic in and around the neighborhood does. "It's a very active street, with a lot of travel lanes and an increasing number of pedestrians," says Megan Koester of the City's Office of Transportation and Workplace Development. "It's a huge transportation corridor. Many people use it for their commute to downtown as well as for all their other transportation needs, including a lot of people who ride their bikes." So, on Broadway, the city will build a new bike lane and add two traffic signals to help cyclists flow up to the next intersection safely. It may also look at adding bus stops on the block that will be impacted by the street reconstruction and widening. But bike lanes don't fix all of the problems people report. People biking near the intersection of Broadway and Pine tell Koester that when buses pull up onto Pine, they have to stay where	0
Image copyright Getty Images Image caption South Korean men wait to march in a parade during a military-sponsored event in Seoul in June 2013 A conservative member of Korea's parliament has suggested that the country take in Muslim refugees. In a survey of local residents, Kim Chul-soo of the Korea Solidarity Party (KSP) said some people in the country would "fear that Islamic societies will be worse than the North". More than 10,000 South Koreans have fled to the North for better prospects. The latest migrant crisis is expected to worsen tensions on the divided peninsula. North Korea has carried out several nuclear tests this year, most recently in January. South Korea and the US blame the regime for the test, although Pyongyang insists it was in self-defence and a test of its short-range missiles. The UN has imposed new sanctions on North Korea over the nuclear test in North Korea's third nuclear test in February. Earlier this week, Pyongyang threatened to carry out a further nuclear test "sooner or later" following threats to kill American citizens in retaliation for the new sanctions. Last week North Korea withdrew its ambassador to South Korea in protest at plans to tighten anti-dumping sanctions over its exports of cheap products. Mr Kim's comments were made in an interview on the US channel MSNBC, the Yonhap news agency reports. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption A US-backed military exercise, Foal Eagle 2012, involved US and South Korean servicemen taking part in joint exercises between the two counties in early 2012 In his opinion, the North's religious authorities "are more strict than their counterparts in the North", he said, without providing further details. "In the North, you're supposed to pray two hours a day," he added. "In the Muslim countries it's more likely they might spend up to 40 minutes in prayer." Asked how it could be possible if "the state rules every single aspect of life," the KSP member said: "The authorities would be less intrusive than the ruling party in the North, and the citizens would be more liberalised, so there would be less discrimination." His comments were also made during an interview with Fox News. Asked whether he supported a potential evacuation, he answered "Yes, of course". South Korea currently takes in about 20,000 refugees per year. South Korea's Unification Ministry said on Tuesday that the number of such refugees had risen by 6,000 to almost 50,000 so far this year. The US defence secretary, Chuck Hagel, said on Tuesday that the US would consider allowing South Korea to take in more refugees, Reuters reports. Earlier this month, North Korea blocked entry visas for 50 people - the largest immigration crackdown in the country's history. However, in November the UN said it would give new asylum applicants the right to work, so they can provide for their families.	0
Trevor Harris has played a lot of football for the Carolina Panthers in recent years. "I haven't been to a game since 2011," Harris said. In 2011, Harris missed all of training camp and was just beginning to get acclimated to the NFL. Since then, he's been Carolina's starter at right tackle, and has been the team's second team right tackle on many occasions. Harris' journey to the NFL has been unique, but at the end of the day, he just wants to play football and is looking forward to the upcoming season. "Obviously, the hardest part is the first game," Harris said. "You get to a new league, a new city with all the new players, and you don't get a lot of sleep on the plane. It's a little bit of a whirlwind. And obviously you want to get out on the field, so we'll see what the rest of the season has to be like and let the fans know." Harris' first year in the NFL as a rookie was not great. He started two games, but his play has taken a turn for the better since then. "I've been working like the team wanted me to," Harris said. "Obviously the coaches do their best, but we've also got to come out here and go out and practice hard and put the times on the board, and see what we get out of them. The last couple of years, they've kind of let me loose, and it's just up to me to keep it up to the standards they said I've set." Harris is not concerned about being an early cut, even if the Panthers are looking for a player at their desired position. "I don't worry about that," Harris said. "I know what I have to do to be successful. It's just about competing, and showing these guys the respect they have as leaders in the locker room, and keeping those standards high. They're all big in there. They want to play. It's just a matter of showing them the respect they're looking for." You can follow me on Twitter @LeviDamien or email me at levi@sportsguychallenge.com	0
Mauricio Pochettino wants to stay at White Hart Lane, despite the club's struggles this season. Tottenham captain Dele Alli has expressed a desire to sign a new deal at Tottenham. The 19-year-old England international has scored nine goals this season in 46 appearances and, while he has been handed a new long-term contract, Alli has also been offered an extension with the club. It is understood that Alli wants to join a club like Chelsea or Manchester City in the summer and will be prepared to stay at Spurs for another season at least. Dyche wants more creativity in his team Tottenham have struggled to put a consistent run together this season and now face a fight to reach the top four ahead of Saturday's North London derby against Watford. Alli has been at Tottenham since the age of 14 and has become a regular starter for the club. The fact that he has been offered a new contract means there is little interest from other clubs to prise him away. "I really like it here," Alli said after the 2-0 win over Tottenham at West Brom on Monday. "It's a very well-oiled machine, a lot of people know me. Tottenham are a great club to be at, and I love it here, and for me to stay at Tottenham, it would be fantastic. "But I am 21 now and there is always that next step, and I am very happy here playing my football, and hopefully one day I can stay and play with the best players in the world." Meanwhile, Tottenham are weighing up plans for a new sporting director to take charge of the club's transfer business over the summer transfer window. Mauricio Pochettino, the manager, has already overseen significant investment in Tottenham's youth system by bringing in Harry Winks, Vincent Janssen and Etienne Capoue, with Pochettino wanting to take further risks with incoming transfers. Tottenham have also sold players this month including Paulinho, the Brazilian midfielder, to Shanghai Shenhua but that is not what Pochettino wants to see happen. "When our business in the transfer market stops and we have to look for talent, I want this to be done after a new manager comes in, a new vision and with a new board," Pochettino said on Monday. "I want a new sporting director, a new head of recruitment to be responsible for that and take the responsibility of picking players."	0
"It was as if a big hand was placed on my shoulder," he said while trying to hold back tears. "I just couldn't believe it. I could barely believe it and as my mind started racing, my legs started to shake. But the coach stayed on me, and the next day he came in with the team and I was able to get back into the team. That was my first championship and to become a champion in the city and as an individual, in my first game, was special. To have that type of support and the community surrounding the program, has allowed me to grow as a person and learn and grow as a college player." But the city has seen something else — a huge shift in how players are treated. Many athletes are not the type to brag about winning the title. The city is also not a town for trophies — a big trophy was not the goal for the city last season, but that will change in the coming years. "For me, going home to my mom and dad is the first thing," Hines said. "For me, my kids are the No. 1 thing first, for them to see a piece of me going back to them and saying I had a better season. If I do not have a piece of me going back to them, it would be sad." For now, he is focusing on the next step — getting the right pieces together to compete for the Rose Bowl. "I'd just love to help my team win," he said. "We're a very talented team that's come together as a team and a group as a group. We all know we're not the best players in the country, but if we get our work done and work hard, we're going to beat anybody in this country and go to the final [Rose Bowl]." He has seen that team and that bond start to grow. After a game against Cal Poly, Hines noticed what was happening at practice when he got back to the complex in Santa Clara. "Everyone was super focused and working together," he said. "That's what it's all about. There was no egos, there was no drama. Just trying to win the game, but a group effort and everyone working together. What a great group of athletes and I've just seen a really great group of guys grow." He also has seen the city come to embrace it. "I've been there several times now, and seeing the number of people coming and really being into it, and the support from everyone from players to parents, that's the most important thing to me," he said. "I'm a part of the city and if I can get the support and the love from anyone, then I'm happy." He and the team will not be doing any more media interviews this week — Hines wants to focus on the rest of the season and focusing on preparing for UCF this weekend. And that's just fine with all of his teammates on defense. "To see that [Hines] has made some great strides and gotten into this position on his own that we have, it definitely brings a lot of confidence," said defensive lineman Andrew Moore. "He's definitely made great strides and we certainly support him."	0
The "P" in the name isn't just for show. The "Practical Inventor" brand was first introduced during the height of the Industrial Revolution, and made famous by inventors such as Henry Ford, who popularized the name by naming his cars after his inventions. The company's mission was to provide inexpensive, durable, and high-quality tools for the working inventor. It was a product that was in direct competition with the then-biggest names in the industry: W. A. P. toolmakers, Remington, and Hamilton Steel. The company was founded in 1874 and made a name for itself by releasing the first model of a pocket-sized pocket-wrench with a rotating socket. The design made it easy to apply a wrench to the wrong side of any object. The company also created tools for tinkerers. The company's founders were avid mechanics with a penchant for tinkering with machines. Today the company still makes a wide variety of precision tools such as the T-square and rotary screwdrivers. The company ceased operations in 1982, and then merged with the company, which had been called the "Inventor Tools Company," after they merged, which had been called the "Ain't I Great" Tool Company, after they merged. The name of the new company was changed to the "Engine Repair Company." In 1996 the company was bought out by the private equity firm, Blackstone, who went on to purchase all sorts of industrial companies. A brand like "Practical Inventor" is destined to live to see another century. You can find the company's tools at almost any hardware store or DIY community. The tools are available in a variety of materials including aluminum, steel, stainless steel, copper, brass, and brass and copper alloys. What was the company's best quality tool?	0
Cannabis users are using a chemical in one of the world's most potent recreational drugs more often than before, a report has argued."While the illicit drug market has grown considerably in recent years, and some argue that the market can only be contained with the use of stricter legislation, there has been no increase in the incidence of cannabis use to date," says the study.The report, conducted by The Global Drug Survey ( GDS ), says use of tetrahydrocannabinol ( tetrahydrocannabinol, THC) has stayed steady in recent years: "It is therefore important to assess whether the rate of use has increased among regular users."The survey says that it found nearly 20 to 25 percent of people aged between 18 and 64 have used cannabis within the last 30 days, but use has held steady and many of those who have used cannabis in the past year have not done so since 2011.This is consistent with past studies where surveys have shown around the same rate of regular use. However, in 2016, the World Health Organization reported that between the ages of 15 and 24, the annual percentage of people who had used cannabis was found to be 3.5 percent, and in countries with a greater prevalence of cannabis use, that percentage is even higher (see Figure for data sources).While this increase in use among regular users has led to some concern that the drug could become harder to access, the results of the GDS report suggest otherwise. The report notes that while illicit drug markets may increase in potency and some countries may see changes to public health services, the use of highly potent illicit drugs such as THC or heroin remain "high" and stable over time."There has been little evidence so far that regular cannabis use has increased, but when considering changes such as changes in law, new policies, and the perception of risk, the level of risk may have increased in some ways," said Dr. David Nutt, the chair of the GDS.The GDS researchers interviewed 1,521 adults in 28 countries in 2014. The majority of all surveyed respondents said they would not want to smoke cannabis on a regular basis - 62.7 percent - but did report using the drug on a monthly or annual basis in 30.9 percent of the cases, and on a daily basis in 1.2 percent of cases. This is higher than the use rates from previous surveys that found around 12 percent of adults reported the use of cannabis on a monthly or annual basis, and around 15 percent reported cannabis use on a daily basis.Most of those adults who said they used cannabis in the past month were male (78.6 percent), aged between 18 and 24 years (63.9 percent), from the Americas (44.9 percent) and Europe (31.4 percent). More than a quarter of all people interviewed said they had used the drug at least once during their entire lifespan. The prevalence of frequent use, usually of one high dose or higher, was less than half the survey's estimate of around 1.7 percent, and it was only around .5 percent in many countries.According to GDS co-director Dr. David Nutt, it is too early to tell whether this recent uptick in use will make the legal cannabis industry flourish in the future."While the legal cannabis market in most countries is currently still tiny - with only 2 percent of the global market now - the continued high levels of use and high risk profile of this group suggests that the legal cannabis industry remains in its earliest stages of growth, and as a result, it's difficult to extrapolate any clear predictions of the future of the industry," said Dr. Nutt.The study also said that, "while the current availability of high potency cannabis poses problems for some users, it is highly unlikely that a change in laws and public attitudes is to blame for the increasing use of cannabis.""These findings demonstrate that increased availability of highly potent cannabis is not associated with increased use among the general population of young people across all 28 countries," said Dr. Andrew Grulich, the lead author of the findings. "The findings of the recent study are consistent with those of previous research on this topic: that there is little evidence from the available evidence to suggest an influence of legislation on the levels of use by young people."	0
The official account said that more than two dozen members of the military were on the ground in northern Tikrit. It would be the most direct American intervention in Iraq since the United States began its battle to oust Saddam Hussein from power in 2003. It was not immediately clear what military assets the American military might be using in the operation. But Iraqi security officials said American warplanes were in flight Thursday, and Iraqi officials had been briefed on the operation through the night. The officials were not authorized to discuss the mission publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. Two of the officials said Iraqi troops, backed by American advisers, had retaken control of the airport in northern Tikrit and that helicopters were flying overhead. One of the officials said the operation was still under way and that it could take six to 10 days. The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the information. Kurdish officials in northern Iraq, meanwhile, said they had captured the village of Dikwa in the vicinity of the airport. Kurdish officials had said that a number of villages in the area had fallen to Kurdish fighters, though none had been taken by American planes. "We are dealing with ISIS now, not with Baghdad or Washington," said Jabar Yawar, the deputy head of Syria's Kurdish P.Y.P. party. "Kurds will take Dikwa. I say with all our force and weapons, not with American planes, it will soon be in our hands."	0

By Richard Thomas As of March 7, the IRS has a backlog of more than $7.7 million in refunds due to individuals who received returns that it says are incomplete or fraudulent. Those refunds were being paid out by an IRS computer program that failed to detect, track, or process billions of taxpayers' returns over the last 30 to 40 years, according to the agency and some government auditors. Auditors found that more than a third of all individual tax returns filed since 1977 showed inconsistencies and errors, such as false or invalid information, or other problems, such as tax refunds that don't match what the government owed taxpayers. Auditors said the IRS computer program was supposed to send the returns to the appropriate refunds unit, known as Unit 8. That unit has been "virtually vacant" since 2011, officials said. When taxpayers complain that they were victimized by a software problem, the agency typically sends them a letter and a letter of offer of a settlement — but no money, according to interviews and other documents reviewed by NBC News. The agency's offer of a settlement is generally between $500 and $10,000. The problem is compounded by the fact that some taxpayers have sent letters claiming that they were victims of computer glitches when in actuality the IRS may have sent a more expensive tax refund because of the computer glitch — and possibly no money to begin with. According to two audits, more than a third of tax returns filed since 1977 — 36.6 million — showed inconsistencies and errors. As of March 7, those taxpayers owe a total of more than $7.7 million in unpaid taxes. The IRS claims to have paid more than $6 million to customers of the software glitch identified by government auditors. But the agency has not fully recovered from the glitch. Taxpayers still owe $4.4 million from an October 2013 "computer glitch" that caused more than two million erroneous refunds to be mailed to innocent taxpayers. "As a result of Unit 8's lack of progress, over two million individuals will owe tax on their 2015 tax returns, and the agency remains in default of its obligations," according to a report by the Treasury's Inspector General for tax administration. "Additionally, over $11.6 billion of federal tax refunds could be under-collected because of this mismatch between taxpayer's actual tax liability and the government's actual tax liability." The Treasury inspector general's office recommended that the IRS adopt new procedures, such as a new system with real-time data access, to catch the fraudulent and incomplete returns and refund issues. "Although we find significant shortcomings in our current tax refund procedures, we have a responsibility to follow through on that recommendation," Steven T. Miller, who is acting commissioner at the time of the audit, said in a statement. "The IRS is committed to fixing mistakes as fast as we can." But as of March 7, the IRS already hasn't fully remedied problems identified by auditors for an additional $5.9 million of tax refunds worth nearly $7 million that taxpayers who are eligible to receive a refund, but haven't yet sent the IRS a letter saying they've done so, or that a refund has not been automatically applied for, owe. Taxpayers who fail to send in their refunds may be eligible to file an objection with the IRS, which will delay the processing, or file suit against the IRS, which can force the court to find in their favor in order to collect the refund or to make some other financial provision for the taxpayer, such as paying the back taxes — which can go toward offsetting the cost of the dispute. The Treasury Inspector General's office said that as of December, the IRS had processed more than 2.2 million refund objections "that have had the potential to impede refunds in collection," and more than 600,000 suits that had been "potentially injurious to IRS collections." The IRS disputes that the backlog of tax refund complaints is as large as the audit suggests. "The overall tax processing backlog in the United States is approximately $2 billion. But as stated in a prior OIG presentation, this represents approximately 17.9 million individuals who have submitted complaints regarding their returns," Miller said. According to Miller, the backlog was due to two primary cause, first, is "that individuals have failed to return their tax-return forms voluntarily from 1983 through 2011, and second, is a backlog from a software technology failure that caused the IRS to process millions of returned returns incorrectly." But Treasury Inspector General, Michael E. Thorndike, said in January 2013 that the IRS software error had been "substantially addressed" a few months ago and that the agency had found ways to avoid sending those returns back to customers unless the individuals were told the IRS had already processed the return. The agency's software glitches began early last year when the IRS computer department began using a system to send automated mail, letters,	0
From the section Gillingham have joined Premier League newcomers Wigan in rejecting a bid from Premier League champions Manchester City but will stand firm on their valuation of midfielder Luke Murphy on loan. Murphy, 20, had been offered to Wigan as part of the deal for former Manchester City defender Richard Dunne. The Latics had been willing to pay around £300,000 for the youngster and offer him a place in the club's senior squad. And while the deal for Dunne has been completed, they will still hold on to the midfielder as they push through an overhaul of their squad. The Latics have also had a bid for Ipswich defender Richard Tonge and Bolton striker Mark Howard rejected.	0
The Canadian Press  TORONTO - The head of Canada's largest pension plan says the Ontario Retirement Pension Plan must do more to encourage participation, saying the new province's retirement system is better when it is viewed through a "grinder's lens." "I'm very sensitive to the fact that this will be a challenge for a variety of reasons," John Corbett, CEO of the Ontario Employees Retirement Income Security Trust, told reporters Tuesday, noting retirees and employees with pension plans have had a hard time coming to terms with the change. "There are two different types of retirees -- ones that have a fixed benefit and ones that are going to receive a benefit based on the assets they place in their [pension] account," he added. "People need to think about how they are going to make that transition in their lifetime as well as how much they are likely to need to retire." The changes, which take effect May 1, 2017, allow some workers to start withdrawing from a defined benefit plan when they turn age 65, up from 65 in 2016. Currently, there are no requirements for workers to leave their full paycheque before age 65, except for Ontario's new defined benefit plans. If people decide to withdraw too much, then they will lose their full pension -- which now amounts to about C$26,000 ($21,600) a year per retiree, compared to under $18,000 for those with a defined contribution plan. If people withdraw too little, they will only lose half of the pensions they have been promised. Ontario is making its changes with the goal of reducing the number of retirees paying into the state pension plan, by about 2,600. Corbett said pensions in Ontario are "in a good place" considering the change but he wants to see those benefits "come in a package that actually encourages people to participate in the pension plan." In Ontario, the pension plan is operated jointly by the government and the three biggest provincially owned pension funds. Ontario Finance Minister Charles Sousa and Corbett were both in Toronto on Tuesday at the release of a report about retirement incomes and the OEP, in which the two noted their government's determination to make sure people are able to keep collecting benefits when they retire. "We really felt we needed to do a better job of communicating the benefits of being part of this plan and actually taking advantage of a solid retiree pension plan," Sousa said. Corbett, meanwhile, expressed sadness after hearing the news about the OEP's dwindling numbers of retirees. "For some people, the plan is more important than their retirement," he said. "People need to decide if this is something that matters to them."	0
The man who has been the leading proponent of the radical Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) was today branded a shill by an ally that claims he 'cannot be trusted'. Talks between Britain and the US are set to begin tomorrow and are believed to be aimed at making it easier for business to set up shop across the Atlantic. But the president of the EU's business lobby group, the EEF, said on Tuesday that business leaders had been given 'no choice' between the rival approaches – which he said were not 'at odds' with each other. President of the European Economic and Social Committee (EESC), Jean Claude Juncker (left) has said he does not believe TTIP will 'have disastrous consequences' for Britain And Jean-Claude Juncker, the commission president who has spearheaded the drive to bring the deal into force by the end of next year, also dismissed concerns it may cause Britain to pay more to Brussels. Speaking at a press conference in Brussels, Mr Juncker said it was 'obvious that the UK is, to a certain extent, dependent on the rest of the EU.' But he added: 'This is not a contradiction – there is no conflict.' After days of claims in the media that the EU and US could pull out of the talks by Friday as there is too much of a risk of an embarrassing defeat, Mr Juncker said: 'Let me be very clear: the negotiations between the two governments will not be possible tomorrow [Friday] if the other side wants to put in motion this ultimatum. 'The two sides are not at odds with each other – the negotiating team of the EU and the US, and the negotiators on the other side, do respect each other, are good friends, and the negotiations will go on.' Under the proposals, the European Commission – which is charged with overseeing TTIP – would have two years to conclude its own talks rather than being forced into one with the US, and it would be able to amend its proposals at any time. But critics have said that could allow multinationals to influence the final pact in a way that would make it unfair to the UK and other countries. On Tuesday, Business Secretary Sajid Javid said: 'While I fully acknowledge the challenges ahead, I am absolutely confident we can deliver a good deal for Britain – no matter how complex.' The EU has insisted it will not pull out as a result of the TTIP talks – as claimed by the Daily Mail and other newspapers – saying the proposed pact would 'ensure a level playing field for European businesses'. President of the European Economic and Social Committee Jean-Claude Juncker (left) said his group 'obviously respected' the US. But the EESC is in fierce dispute with the US over TTIP, with Mr Juncker (right) and EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager in an acrimonious split over the deal The move was condemned by the UK, which is facing a fresh backlash after the Mail reported allegations that Sir Ivan Rogers was 'seriously compromised' in the role before he took over as head of the UK's intelligence service. Sir Ivan, 61, the former head of MI6 and GCHQ, recently warned that the EU risked being 'run by the unelected'. He said EU leaders have 'little understanding of the way a civil society works' and have been 'slow to listen' to civil society groups. This month, the EU launched a probe into a series of alleged leaks by senior officials to a German paper and claimed Mr Juncker has already been accused or sacked by German politicians and MEPs for his role in negotiating the deal. It claimed that if leaks to German newspapers the New York Times and the Washington Post did not 'seriously affect the negotiation process', then Mr Juncker had 'no room to criticize the US authorities'. Mr Juncker took a swipe at the Daily Mail's 'unfair' reporting of him and accused the paper's reporter of 'making up facts'. 'I'm not surprised that the British press is making up some facts in order to attack somebody,' he said. And he warned it would be 'difficult to trust the EU if there is no mutual respect between its member states'. Mr Juncker (pictured with the US president yesterday) told reporters he supported his trade commissioner in his efforts to 'fight corruption' Mr Juncker insisted on Tuesday that the TTIP negotiations with US were 'at all hours of the day' and that he had been in talks with a wide range of American businesses, including Google and FedEx. He insisted that 'this is an entirely serious negotiation', adding: 'I can only be optimistic.' The US Trade Representative, Michael Froman, has also been accused of 'blandly lying' to French journalists about the	0
By Robert Romano With all the noise over the President's planned executive action on immigration, the mainstream media have a hard time getting into a conversation on the issue, since there appears to be little to no interest from the American people in the matter. But there are plenty of people who would like to talk about immigration and the president's executive orders, even if it's as a talking point. That's true even though most Americans don't think the President should be able to do that at all to the law-abiding citizens in America. In a May 15-April 22 survey by the Pew Research Center, 59 percent of respondents say the president should have the right to do whatever he wants when it comes to immigration and the economy. But that number was almost the same level — 58 percent — when the same question was asked in December. And in January 2014, the same group of respondents said the president should be able to make that decision, while just 36 percent said the opposite. But it's the president's action to the people of this country that the issue is concerned. Here are some stats, courtesy of the Pew Research Center, that are worth looking at, if only as an example of where the American people would like to see immigration go. — A majority of Republicans think more needs to be done to reduce immigration, but the same amount of people say immigrants should not be allowed to become citizens before being naturalized. — Almost three-fourths (72 percent) of Americans say "there should be a law that prevents immigrants from receiving citizenship," even when asked by whom they want it to be applied. Only 45 percent said they wanted a law that would provide for the same effect without mentioning legal immigrants. — Overall, Republicans are slightly more apt than Democrats to say immigrants who are already citizens should be allowed to become citizens. Among Republicans, 63 percent say that, but among Democrats, the numbers are flipped: 64 percent say immigrants should have to leave to become citizens. — The number of Americans who believe legal immigrants don't contribute economically is up 13 points, from 45 percent in 2009 to 59 percent in 2016. But with the same group, 45 percent is still higher, indicating the fact that they can't even come close to paying into the economy. — Democrats and independents have become more supportive of admitting more legal immigrants, but they still oppose doing so even more, 62 percent to 55 percent. — There remain strong, albeit less widespread opinions that immigrants are driving down American wages and that foreign workers are a drain on the economy. Fifty-one percent say immigrants are a "cost to U.S. workers; lower wages; take jobs away from U.S. workers," and 35 percent say immigration benefits the economy more than "the American workers." — There are big demographic differences between Republicans and Democrats on immigration and what a president should do about it. While 83 percent of Republicans say the president should stop illegal immigration as long as it doesn't threaten American jobs, only 48 percent of Democrats agree with that assertion. Seventy-nine percent of Republicans support a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants, compared with 64 percent of Democrats. Now, the president is unlikely to do anything about immigration as he moves forward with executive actions on deportation relief and on increasing the number of federal employees to work on immigration, but there is a lot of public outcry over the issue. What people think should happen and what should be done, even though it's not a popular position, should be discussed. Robert Romano is the senior editor of Americans for Limited Government.	0
LONDON (Reuters) - More than 3.5 million people are believed to have been affected by a cyber attack that hit businesses and media companies across the globe last month, putting their network security at risk, according to a report released on Thursday. A man walks past a sign displaying the Google logo outside the new Google Store on 5th Avenue in New York's Herald Square June 6, 2012. REUTERS/Mike Segar The research, conducted by the Institute for Critical Infrastructure Technology think-tank, also warned of the risk of future attacks as organizations move to "hybrid" security models that include a mixture of traditional approaches and automated ones. Cyber attacks have become a major problem for the world's business community, and the cost is expected to reach hundreds of billions of dollars each year by 2025 due to the complexity and sophistication of them, the ICT report said. It highlighted the increasing use of "hybrid" security, which is one approach that combines traditional approaches with automation tools, such as intrusion detection systems, intrusion prevention and prevention systems, computer forensic analysis and automated attacks that rely on machine learning to find weaknesses. "Hybrid security offers a cost-effective solution to organizations that have decided to incorporate more sophisticated approaches," said Adam Levin, the founder and director of the ICT foundation. "The traditional security model includes a mix of manual security controls (such as user passwords) and automation, so that attackers may gain access but are never successful in executing a destructive attack." A man sits next to signs displaying an image of Google's logo outside the new Google Store on 5th Avenue in New York's Herald Square June 6, 2012. REUTERS/Mike Segar But the hybrid approach, which has been piloted in the UK and Canada, is still being tested in other countries. "Organizations are seeing the opportunity, but are having challenges scaling it up. The challenge is that no-one is quite sure on what the best path to take is," Levin said. He said in the United Kingdom, attackers could not simply compromise individual sites; they had to "steal" them from other companies or be "piggybacked" on their website hosting company's servers. U.S. President Barack Obama called for new cybersecurity regulations this month, and a congressional commission is set to make recommendations for a national cybersecurity strategy.	0

A Texas judge has cleared the way for the state's ban on same-sex marriage to take full effect. (Reuters) A Texas judge has cleared the way for the state's ban on same-sex marriage to take full effect. (Reuters) The Obama administration is asking a federal judge in Texas that has blocked a Texas gay-marriage ban to decide whether to extend the protections afforded to same-sex couples under the federal Defense of Marriage Act and the equal-protection clause of the Constitution to gay-marriage states that have passed such laws. U.S. Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. asked U.S. District Judge Orlando Garcia of Corpus Christi to grant a preliminary injunction Thursday, to prevent the state from enforcing the 2013 law banning gay marriage and also pending a decision about Texas's lawsuit against the Obama administration. He also asked Garcia to decide if same-sex couples have the right to marry in those states. "This is not just about Texas," Holder wrote in the motion. "We are all bound together by our rights derived from our respective constitutions and laws." As of Thursday morning, same-sex marriages are legal in 17 states, including Massachusetts and California. Garcia rejected Texas's arguments in 2012 that it is barred from enforcing the state's gay marriage ban. Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott, a Republican, has said the Obama administration would ignore a court order that says Texas was in contempt of court if it took further steps to allow gay marriages in defiance of the court's decision. Abbott said Thursday that federal authorities were trying to "extort" Texas by threatening to shut down the federal government if the state ignores its court decision. "To further punish Texas and force the State to violate basic constitutional liberties is intolerable under any circumstances," Abbott said. The case could mark the first time the U.S. Supreme Court reviews a state law banning same-sex marriage, and the high court could take up the case by next month.

But when asked what the government hopes to gain by fighting in court, rather than through Congress, the officials said nothing is off the table. "We expect this case to go to the Supreme Court," said Deputy Assistant Attorney General Matthew Axelrod, who oversees the federal government's LGBT-rights programs. Axelrod acknowledged the government is likely taking the case to the Supreme Court for the first time. While Texas has already begun taking the lead in the state's suit before the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals this week, that court has jurisdiction over the case because Texas is a district court. "When the appeals court reviews any challenge to a state law, the 4th Court of Appeals can decide whether to review it — just as it took the opportunity in the wake of our decision on marriage equality to review several state challenge to same-sex marriage bans, and declined to review challenges to marriage bans in Idaho and Utah as well," the Justice Department said in its motion. An attorney for Texas said he is skeptical. Michael H. Weinstein said the Obama administration's letter is not a legally binding decision and that his office will file a response in court. "There remains very great skepticism that the administration's legal analysis is anything more than a threat," said Weinstein, president of the Gay and Lesbian Advocates & Defenders and lead attorney representing the Texas plaintiffs in the case. Garcia has indicated during a hearing in February that his ruling against Texas will be upheld, noting Texas was given a reprieve from the legal fight if lawmakers took similar action in the state. A spokesman for Garcia's office, Bill Rausch, declined to comment.	0
From: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LZl9XKg1cI&feature=youtu.be  From: 'Dr. Robert E. O'Reilly, Ph.D., N.D., and co-author, "How to Talk to Your Child About the Truth"  As an American mother I grew up with a strong desire to find the truth, when I could not find it even when the facts pointed me in any direction. I was taught to ignore those around me who tried to persuade me otherwise. I remember my father trying to tell me a story about a car accident that almost killed my mother and my younger sister and her best friend. But he told me it was a hoax, that my mother couldn't have survived the accident. The story kept coming back to me, but I wouldn't have any idea what to do, I had no doubt that what the other side was saying was not true, the details were wrong. As children we are especially vulnerable to the lies we believe to be factual because we do not have a strong sense of responsibility or empathy.  A few years later, my husband and I discovered a book, "The Big Lie," for a few dollars in the library, written by a man who claimed he had invented the lie and could tell it from facts. The book was filled with errors, half-truths, distorted versions of events and it seemed as though each chapter was told in a different tone on each page! It was frightening because in the first few pages he claimed, for example, that his book, "The Great Santini Fraud," (published in 1973) provided proof that the moon landing was a hoax by showing images of alleged landing sites that did not match the photographs taken after the landing. The photographs he provided did not prove this.  After reading "The Santini Fraud" my husband and I talked for over three hours trying to persuade the author that he was wrong. One of the things that really made a profound difference was when my husband told the author that his evidence for the existence of Jesus Christ had never been proven and was in fact a fraud. For the first time in several years the author admitted that his book was, in fact, a fraud. It took less than two minutes for the truth to hit home: Christ never died on the cross and the Bible he quoted in its chapters was written as a result of centuries of human error!  What I have talked to my daughter about as she grows up, I have talked about with my family, for we are all susceptible to misinformation. All of us love to believe the impossible. We are also susceptible to the stories that the media tell us about ourselves. I have heard many stories about my mother, my sister, my sister (who has no memory of it), my father and my husband that don't conform to what we know to be true.  What are you taught when you hear the lies of the media? Many of us are not taught about the truth in education, science or the Bible, nor about how to know the truth. In truth, it might be even worse, we are not taught how to know what to believe and that there should be a choice available to us to make up our own minds. When someone tells you that a politician is a racist, or you are told that the earth is flat, or "your doctor" is not really a doctor but a person who sells a product you can buy, the media is not telling you the truth. Those who push these ideas are often not the people you really want to be thinking of. There is a tremendous disconnect between what you have been taught to believe and how it affects you and how you behave. We often cannot tell who is telling us the truth and who is telling us what we want to hear.  The more you hear what they want to hear, the more likely you are to believe them. You can try to be more selective of the information you receive and you can also try to understand the difference between what is true or false. If we ignore what we are told about the world, we will have no problem believing what they wish to believe. But we may find ourselves in a difficult situation because we will not have the same level of knowledge that we have once had.  One way or another we will still be held responsible for making up our minds and choosing to act from our own convictions, not from media stereotypes.  "The most effective way of making a point when you are on the outside of a crowd of people is to keep your audience far enough apart from you to be beyond personal criticism, just far enough apart to give you the freedom of association." - Robert B.

"Hacking is in," the NSA's former chief of staff Keith Alexander told an audience at the University of Texas in Austin on Monday. "The question is not how do we stop it, as much as how do we defend against it." The U.S. government is becoming a "cyber security" first responder, rather than just an "information security" one, a role once dominated by the NSA. "You just never know what will happen," Alexander told the audience of IT security professionals, as reported by ProPublica, the New York Times, the Center for Investigative Reporting, and Bloomberg Businessweek. This is a significant shift in a decade-and-a-half of the United States becoming an information security first responder by way of the NSA. The change, Alexander said, was necessary, he explained, because the US has become the victim of massive, sophisticated hacking and cyber espionage campaigns. There is a "very robust commercial" and "state-sponsored" Russian cyber espionage campaign "that is penetrating all of the critical infrastructure sectors of the country. We have seen a lot of the cyber attacks that go after nuclear weapons and pipelines, we have seen a lot of the cyber attacks that go after our elections," he said. "I think one of the biggest challenges we face … is figuring out how to protect our own infrastructure from such attacks." This is, perhaps, the first time we've heard the NSA be so forthright about how its mission has changed in the last couple of years. In the years since the Snowden revelations, NSA analysts have said that they believe the Russian threat is far from over, though their capabilities have. "We need to prepare for them [Russian hacking]," Alexander said. The NSA is not just concerned with cyber security against "state-sponsored" hackers. They've long seen themselves as part of a global information security arm of the U.S. government and the military. But that was the NSA. It's the NSA now fighting the cyberwar on, not just foreign governments like Russia, or even foreign cyber groups. It's the NSA and the intelligence community, at the forefront of both the NSA's "intelligence gathering and cyber offensive." On Monday's conference call with reporters afterwards, NSA spokesman Vanee Vines confirmed this new role, calling that a "new emphasis" for the agency—a role "consistent with our focus on protecting the nation against cyber threats from foreign actors, including those that target government entities." Last week the White House announced it would spend nearly $1 billion to help make the NSA and other intelligence agencies more agile and capable. It also said the budget would be more than doubled to the maximum level allowed by law for the spy agency. Alexander and the other top NSA officials will now have another $21 billion to spend. The NSA has previously been criticized for what experts call poor organization on cybersecurity operations. The office that is responsible for the country's cyber threat information—the Office of the Director of National Intelligence—was set up only years ago, but doesn't have sufficient resources to take on the cyber threat. "It's a mess at every level," former NSA head Keith Alexander told a Washington security conference last year. "No one has the capacity right now," he said. When asked if it was easy to do a single successful attack on the United States, Alexander replied, "Not at all." But Alexander's announcement on Monday was more like a press conference than a statement, with only one actual question (more on that below). The questioner was David Rivkin, a Washington lawyer who now serves on the President's National Security Advisory Board, which advises the White House on the threats and challenges that cybersecurity poses. ProPublica asked what the NSA was doing to protect critical infrastructure. In response to this question, Vines again clarified: The NSA is currently looking for new ways to protect critical infrastructure. This will include looking at what more our workforce can learn about cyber and its methods and how the NSA can more effectively defend and protect critical infrastructure. Our intelligence community has done significant research on cyber security and has identified vulnerabilities in government systems. The NSA is working on integrating cyber defense efforts at the agency and with the intelligence community. This integrated, multi-disciplinary effort will help ensure our nation can better defend its critical infrastructure. Vines said that some of the research is already on defense lines, but more will be done as the agency "further evolves to address the increasingly complex cyber threats we face." Another question, ProPublica asked of Alexander, was about the NSA's role in the Trump transition team. Alexander said he had no involvement with Trump's transition, but added the same kind of public outreach that has been done for prior presidential nominees. He said the NSA is "engaging in the normal, non-controversial interactions that we've done with many presidential candidates." However, he noted that he has not met his boss, President elect	0
When we decided to release this game we made certain assumptions: 1) we knew the engine would only be as good as the game's performance. 2) we knew we would need a powerful machine to test and optimize our game. Well we are happy to report that the game is running on our PC build of DirectX®11.2 with the frame rate up to 60 FPS with the following settings: 1920×1080 1280×800 1024×768 1024×600 1024×576 1024×464 The resolution options are as follows: 1280×1024 1680×1050 1920×1200 2048×1536 2K In addition, we ran at a quality setting of "High" and ran the game on medium graphics resolution. If our PC is capable of running this game then the GPU should be able to do so as well but, as always, we are always learning and testing. As you can see, the game runs smooth at 60 FPS with the resolution set to all-in-one. As you can also see in the framerate charts, the game does not look bad at it's native resolution of 1920×1080. What you can see in the top left, and what is shown in most cases of our reviews, is the difference between 60 FPS and 60 FPS on the same settings as you can see in this screenshot: The second screenshot is the same test but done with medium graphics. You can see even more detail visible in the game in this case.	0
Newly released court documents and an email trail reveal a close relationship between former FBI Director James Comey and a "former close associate of Mueller's" and reveal how high the Obama Justice Department pressured Special Counsel Mueller to terminate the FBI's investigation into former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Fawny Newsome, a former reporter for The Wall Street Journal, wrote an open letter to FBI Director James Comey after the former Comey had already concluded an investigation of the Hillary Clinton investigation for which Newsome was a key source. This letter was released to the public by a conservative group and the FBI in June of 2017. In the open letter, Newsome details the "close connections" Comey had with James Kallstrom, a man who he refers to as his "close associate and friend". In addition to having a criminal history, Kallstrom was married to the daughter of Bill Clinton's assistant, James McDougal, who was convicted on 12 counts of fraud and conspiracy for the misappropriation of funds in the Whitewater Savings & Loan. McDougal's lawyer used to serve as Deputy Attorney General James Comey's personal attorney. In the case of the Whitewater investigation, Comey and Mueller used McDougal as a witness to ensure that a case of fraud was not brought in the case. Kallstrom also had a relationship with Mueller who was his legal counsel at the time he was hired by the FBI following his retirement from McKinsey Global. Newsome describes how the FBI "seemed to favor" Kallstrom as an investigator and that he felt Kallstrom was "a good guy, who would take care of my client and be straightforward." On July 4, 2013, shortly after Clinton sent and received over 13,000 emails from her private email server on the subject of Chelsea Clinton's wedding with Marc Mezvinsky, former Attorney General Eric Holder called Comey and told him to end the Clinton investigation, saying, "the American people deserve to get the full and complete facts immediately. This is the way we always handle matters that involve national security, and especially when it involves the top two national security officials." Comey, according to the email trail uncovered by Breitbart News with the help of a Freedom of Information Act request, had also discussed this new and "sizable" investigation with Kallstrom at a dinner and at a memorial dinner to former Attorney General Eric Holder in 2015. Newsome describes how after Comey started the investigation, he was approached by Kallstrom in December and offered a "very important job." Newsome said after Comey had "reached out" to him in a number of meetings in his early days at the FBI, he had made it clear to his friend that he did not want any sort of "interference" in the investigation. In his open letter, Newsome detailed how he had written and called his own resignation letter to Comey and then was offered the job at the FBI "right away". Newsome did not know how a large investigation like this came to being, but said that Comey "had no qualms about pushing me" to do so. "It was clear early on that the investigations were going to involve the Clintons and their close cohorts. The investigation was far different than the initial investigations into my colleague Michael Flynn. In the end I think Mr. Comey made the right decision to let the [investigation] go," Newsome wrote. During his tenure as FBI director, Comey investigated Hillary Clinton's private email server, both while she was Secretary of State and thereafter. He also sent two letters to Congress at the end of his term which were highly critical of Clinton. He had the power to bring criminal charges, but did not do so. "Comey had the authority to bring charges against Mrs. Clinton, but did not," Breitbart News Senior Editor-at-Large Peter Schweizer said at the time of Comey's decision. "I want no political appointee to decide that the law does not apply to him." According to Newsome's open letter, he went from calling Comey his friend, to an FBI Director who was "very close" to the Clintons and who would not only end the Clinton investigation, but also make them pay a very high price for it. He was told by "James Comey" in March of 2016 that he "had a lot of work to do and needed to go to New York, and he asked me to stay…I had to tell my team that I would be travelling to New York, and I told them I needed time to think about it." In addition, he said that on March 22, he was taken from the FBI headquarters at FBI Headquarters to the "Gathering Place" at FBI Field Office in Washington D.C. where "the senior officials to whom I had reported were gathered. They briefed me on the Clinton investigation. I was told if I was there that day that I had to go and do the interview." Newsome	0
1. We are all aware of the incredible beauty of our planet, our oceans, and the vast and varied landscapes that comprise its lands. It is only natural, then, to wonder what it will be like when our own bodies are transformed into a more pristine environment. 2. That's what these amazing artists from the Philippines have done. Through the sheer power of their creativity and skill, they have built a model that looks absolutely gorgeous. The results are pretty much like an accurate depiction of what Earth will look like in the not-too-distant future. 3. You'd never guess that these gorgeous drawings were a work of science fiction. After all, what is a drawing but a flat image with dimensions equal to a few percent of the real world? You'll also notice how many of the curves in this model do not really conform to reality. It's an intriguing idea that gives us a chance to contemplate how we might live with our bodies in the future. 4. They have created a world that looks a lot like our own, but at the same time does not resemble it in any sort of detail. This is the reality of a future that we can never see. Imagine Earth turned into a virtual planetarium—a virtual universe in which we explore the worlds of other civilizations from throughout the universe. 5. So are we going to be able to live in the world that is imagined in these drawings? It would not be impossible. One of the best places to look at how the planet will look like in the not-too-distant future is the work of scientists like Carl Sagan, a scientist who was so concerned with these issues that he wrote this wonderful foreword to this book: "If our imagination is ever to do the job we are trying to do in searching for intelligent life out there on another planet, perhaps a picture is worth more than a thousand words. This planet would seem to hold many unique possibilities for human life, but even with all our resources, we will not be able to get there, no matter how hard we look." What did you think of this?

In late 2015, a new generation of Android smartphone debuted in China. At that time, the iPhone 6 and its accompanying iPhone 6 Plus were available in China. However, Chinese phone manufacturers quickly caught on with the feature, as they realized that China's smartphone market shares were declining and they needed an alternative to the iPhone and iPhone Plus. That alternative was the Android system. And the Android system was quickly adopted in China and then worldwide. Chinese brands like Huawei, ZTE, Xiaomi and TCL soon began offering Android smartphones in China. As the Android smartphone market grew and Chinese brands began offering Android smartphones, sales were so successful that those smartphones quickly expanded internationally. China has always had a very good mobile market and many Chinese brands such as Huawei, Lenovo, Samsung, Oppo and Sony also saw strong sales with the Android smartphones. Huawei introduced the Mate 9 in early 2016 with a large 6-inch display at a premium price. A few years passed as Chinese brands such as Samsung, ZTE, Oppo, Motorola and Xiaomi introduced more affordable Android smartphones. It seems as now that the Android ecosystem is very well established, and Chinese brands have started to introduce more affordable phones, and the Chinese OEMs are also selling their smartphones abroad. In recent months, Chinese manufacturers have introduced smartphones ranging from entry level to mid-level, such as the Mi5 and Mi5 mini. Huawei has also introduced the Ascend Mate 8 Pro and the Ascend P7 Lite. Xiaomi introduced the Redmi Note 4s with Android 6.0 Marshmallow. In March 2017, China's biggest manufacturer, Huawei, launched its own flagship, the Ascend Mate 8 to compete with the Xiaomi Redmi Note 4s and Apple iPhone 7 Plus. In April 2017, LG launched the G6, followed by the G6 Pro in June. Meanwhile, Samsung launched the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8 Plus. Meanwhile, Motorola (with its new lineup including Moto Z) launched smartphones like Moto Z Max, Moto G5s Plus, Moto G5 Plus, Moto Z Play and Moto Z Play Droid. And Lenovo introduced the Lenovo Phab 2 Pro. In the past, Chinese brands have also launched entry-level to mid-range smartphones such as the Huawei MediaPad 7 Vogue, Xiaomi Redmi Note 4s, OnePlus 3, Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 Pro, Mi 5s, Xiaomi Redmi Note 4, Huawei Redmi Note 5 and the Motorola Moto G5 Plus. Chinese brands also launched budget-focused smartphones such as the Xiaomi Redmi Note 4, Mi Max 2, Mi Max 3 and the Mi Max 2 Lite, among others. China is quickly becoming a very important market for global technology companies. As global companies such as Huawei and Lenovo have expanded their presence in China and others such as Oppo, ZTE, Google and others have also started developing their presence in the country, it becomes even more important for global companies to offer more affordable products in China. As Chinese companies are launching Android smartphones at cheaper prices, it becomes even easier for global companies to offer smartphones for cheaper prices to Chinese consumers. And I would be surprised if Chinese smartphone companies do not continue to further roll out cheaper offerings.	0
Ticket sales were disappointing at the box office yesterday (Dec. 29) as "Avengers: Age Of Ultron" and "The LEGO Movie" missed estimates, sending the day's box office tally to $94 million.

In the late 1940s British soldiers with the Royal Army Medical Corps (RAMC) began a programme of sterilisation, in a bid to rid the male troops of the most undesirable female characteristics, like small breasts and high-cheekbonedness. Today, that sterilisation policy remains controversial, because the military's record on treating the female prisoners is, shall we say, less than stellar. But what of those soldiers who were sterilised? Could there be health consequences? And what about the women who are still alive? Have we learned our lesson? According to Mary Robinson, a historian of medicine at the University of Manchester: "Sterilisation is the only form of forced contraceptive that we have a record of. The practice of forcible sterilisation became legal in Britain in 1956. Prior to then, the practice was illegal and the medical profession tended to condemn it. A few medical commentators have voiced their opposition. Many others have taken a neutral position. The Royal British Legion in London recently made two women available as speakers at a symposium [in December 2016] about their experiences." When we ask the soldiers we interview how their sterilisation as soldiers affected them later in life, for example through pregnancy or a mental health problem, a number of replies inevitably come back. They have endured the consequences of a sterilisation which they never intended. The process of forced sterilisation The medical professionals who participated in forcing soldiers into sterilisation programmes often believed that the soldiers would make a good father. "Sterilisation was a way of controlling birth rates," wrote Dr R S Welsing, a medical consultant during the Third World War. "The aim was to make sure that the new generations were not too large. The idea was that all of Britain would go sterile." It was thought that the British army would be able to stop the problem of population growth through strict regulations on sex relations and birth control. It would also be possible, many believed, to prevent the sexualisation of women. This was not so, however: the troops still had sex – with the consent, sometimes, of military superiors and even the soldiers themselves. "The practice of forcing soldiers to undergo sterilisation was a form of female genital mutilation in the same way as female circumcision was a form of male genital mutilation," says Robinson. Women who underwent sterilisation were commonly seen as 'disorders' or 'sexual deviants'. The practice became politically unpopular, but it didn't lead the sterilised soldiers to commit suicide. Instead, the effect on their health was seen as being negative in itself. "The practice was regarded as an effective method of making males behave with less aggression during sex," says Robinson. "They would have been encouraged to seek out a woman for intercourse with more regularity." The impact on women's mental health can be seen in the case of Margaret Ann. The Army Medical Service refused her request to have a second child, thinking it would make her mood less volatile in future. Margaret Ann died in 1962 at the end of her army period. "She was suffering from severe post-partum depression that caused severe anxiety and fear," says Robinson. Margaret Ann's children were raised by different mothers, never knowing that their mother suffered from what was commonly considered a psychological health condition. "They thought she had a breakdown and they were quite happy for the children to have different fathers." In another case, a soldier's girlfriend asked to be sterilised so that she could have a second baby, on the grounds that her second pregnancy had been difficult for her. The Army Medical Service refused the request. Margaret Ann's daughters grew up without knowing of their mother's mental health problems. Margaret Ann's suicide Despite the medical service's reservations, the sterilisation programme continued, after Margaret Ann went on a hunger strike. She threw herself out of a fifth-floor window, before being arrested and rushed to a psychiatric hospital. She hanged herself in the wards. Today, her cause of death is not considered to be a suicide – she left a note, which describes her suicide as a result of her "wonderful and happy experience of a second pregnancy". In some ways, she was lucky, as the Army Medical Service agreed to carry out her sterilisation. In 1948, the same year Margaret Ann committed suicide, the same group of British physicians – the Royal College of Surgeons – had recommended a medical sterilisation of all servicemen. Instead of going ahead with this plan, the doctors went on to argue that the procedure should be left to women. The British government, however, opposed this. In 1969, Margaret Ann's family was successful in making a Supreme Court ruling that the decision shouldn't be legally binding. In the end, Margaret Ann's death affected just a small number of soldiers. Those who were sterilized suffered in their personal, physical and mental health, as did the soldiers who were not. Today, Margaret Ann's case still raises the issues about women	0
A few years ago, I spent a year in North Carolina working in the local law enforcement field. In that position, I was able to get to know the local people and their values. The common thread I learned was they were concerned about the quality of public schools and the quality of their local schools. Since then, school choice has exploded across the country. States like Georgia, Florida, North Carolina, and Virginia have passed legislation to allow parents to use public money to send their children to private schools, and a handful of other states have taken it a step further, with "choice" mandates that give parents more flexibility with how their children are taught, or what schools they send their children to. North Carolinians, on average, spend roughly the same amount of money per child on public education as other states. What sets us apart is the relative percentage of children in high poverty. In 2014, more than 20 percent of kids in North Carolina were living in poverty, compared to 13.4 percent nationwide. Of the nation's top 10 high economic schools, only two of them were located in North Carolina. This is very telling. If North Carolinians aren't providing the best public school option in our state, where is the problem? The average household in North Carolina has $50,000 in disposable income, compared to $33,000 nationally. Most of this is attributable to the wages lost from manufacturing, and those are projected to grow in number and size. In this economy, we need an economy where, if you work hard, you have a chance to get ahead. We need a workforce that is prepared for the jobs that are coming in the future. That begins with good public schools, and this is why we need to make the choices and provide more opportunities for parents. As we continue to grow as a state, we need to be making smarter, more informed decisions about what services we need, where we can deliver those services, and how we can make the state's priorities a top priority in terms of funding its public schools, whether it is preschool education, the K-12 school system, or early education and education. It's also worth noting this week that the state's Public Facilities Commission, which licenses the state's airports, also voted to cut funding by about $100 million on a budget of nearly $12 billion for the next fiscal year. That decision comes on the heels of a federal court ruling that the airports would be subject to the Affordable Care Act. In this economy, we need to be making smarter, more informed decisions about what services we need, where we can deliver those services, and how we can make the state's priorities a top priority in terms of funding its public schools, whether it is preschool education, the K-12 school system, or early education and education. A recent state report found that North Carolina spends about $10,000 per pupil per year on education, a percentage that is about the same as the state of California, though North Carolina gets slightly less than three times the amount of money per child than California. This should be alarming to people who are working to make sure our public schools are funded. The federal government and the state of North Carolina both bear a shared responsibility to make sure all children have access to a quality education. We can do that, and all we need now is for the legislature to come together in a spirit of collaboration and compromise and work together on our shared goal.	0
There's now an official answer! The United Nations has released its list of the most dangerous cities in the world. Topping the list is Baghdad. The United Nations has released its list of the most dangerous cities in the world. Topping the list is Baghdad. Here's what the UN says: "The list shows cities that received UN-ranked 'most dangerous city' rankings for their overall safety for the fifth consecutive year in 2013. The list shows that the worst of the worst of the world continues to dominate in many ways." The report also gives some interesting nugget by nugget descriptions of the places on the list. I think the most striking comparison is the number of homicides registered by violent crimes in America compared with the murders reported in Iraq, where UN peacekeepers are being sent to stop a civil war. But here's the most important thing: The world is a much safer place today than it was in 2013, according to the 2013 Global Urban Violence Map. There were nearly as many murders worldwide in 2013 as there were just three years ago. I'm happy to be alive in 2013. (Via The Huffington Post, Image is a screen grab.)	0
This article is from the archive of our partner . If you are an American with internet access, and you go to Wikipedia, you may notice that your address is different than a person without access. On Thursday, Google started rolling out a software update that will remove the country-specific data from your account, meaning that you are no longer able to show up in a map under your birth country, or any of your current home states. Google says that its data was not accurate enough to give accurate results for its search results, which are based on an "online crowdsourced consensus." It has also been trying to improve the accuracy since June last year when Google issued a statement saying that it "did not maintain any records to provide geographic coverage or to allow for country-specific search queries." The change doesn't mean that users can't still see some of the results that they did before the change in July. However, a link to a page about a specific place on Wikipedia for a particular country is not going to show up for a person in, say, New York. Instead, a non-existent page about your country will appear. The change comes amidst a backlash against the company that is based in the U.S. over privacy and privacy issues. In September, Google released a statement apologizing to users after it decided to change the default search results to reflect the U.S. population by counting residents by ZIP code. Google didn't say why the changes were made, but many people believed the company was trying to promote more ads, which is illegal in the U.S. The change in search data for all users will take a week to fully work its way through Google's infrastructure. In the meantime, Google says that it is "notifying affected users and we are working hard to restore the correct data." This article is from the archive of our partner The Wire.	0

This content was published on October 13, 2017 12:03 PM Oct 13, 2017 - 12:03 The government has promised to raise the minimum wage to at least CHF7.55 an hour, but many workers want to see further improvements, including a new minimum wage for cantinas (Keystone) With Switzerland's economic growth slowly declining, the country's highest earners face one extra thing for their troubles – more taxation on their earnings. The federal government announced last month that it would raise Swiss wages by at least CHF7.55 an hour (CHF4.90 at the Swiss franc) per year for at least a decade. But in the latest move, the government also suggested that it would also take steps to raise the cost of living in Switzerland. A recent OECD report suggests that minimum wages are not the only way to curb income inequality in the country. There are proposals currently underway to make labour market flexibility and job training more attractive when it comes to hiring and firing. At present, employers cannot sack or fire workers for any reason other than illness or accident within a year of the incident. They can also choose from a number of mechanisms, which include: The loss of a paid holiday within 12 months A decrease in the income tax No automatic deduction of tax from wages A ban on deductions from employee salaries for pension contributions The creation of a new minimum wage for cantinas. A proposal was already introduced in 2012 and is expected to be extended at a later stage "The current labour market for employees is in many ways restrictive, particularly in the areas of employment stability and job security," a government report said in March 2016. As a consequence, workers with certain kinds of skills are often reluctant to change jobs. The report also suggests that workers with the right social skills should always be given priority for an entry into the labour market if they are offered a job. The same cannot be said for workers that are considered too dependent on their employers. However, Swiss workers do seem to be getting more flexibility. The OECD report suggests that an increase in the use of flexible worker contracts was responsible for the increasing rates of employee turnover. Switzerland's political decision making remains relatively decentralised, which means that most policies are up for discussion at local level, where decisions often don't play well with the business community. In addition, the public sector remains relatively inefficient and its share of Swiss employment is below that which is required to finance its social insurance contributions in the country. However, the government's decision to focus on social policy was also aimed at alleviating rising income inequality. According to the latest report from the OECD, a high "progressive social share" is a vital component of effective labour market policy. A progressive social share is defined not only by measures aimed at making employment more attractive, such as wage protection, job opportunities and training programs, but also by measures that facilitate workers' flexibility when searching for new employment. The government has promised its new rules will give more flexibility to workers and employers, by introducing a new system of social insurance for the canton. This is currently supported by an amendment to the Employment Act. The new Social Insurance and Compensation Act will go into effect by the end of 2018. A special fund will help the cantons that don't have the same level of insurance provisions as Switzerland. The amendment's supporters say that it will provide a fairer framework to address the social needs of different cantons. A spokesman for the parliament's centre-right Bloc-Eurondemans group said that this "will give the right balance between the interests of labour and those of social security and guarantee a strong and viable social safety net". According to the government, employers in Switzerland receive more than €4,000 per employee each year. The new system could result in some extra cash flowing into the pockets of workers and employers. The amendment was the result of a consultation with the canton of Valais, which proposed a minimum wage for cantonal workers and more flexibility for employment. However, many cantons will not be happy with the new regulations. "There are already many provisions that can help cantons meet these needs," said Andre Känel, minister for industrial and social development in Valais. But Switzerland is on the right track when it comes to the concept of a progressive social share. Switzerland has been struggling to ensure an equal share of jobs for women since the 20th century, as they were systematically less often chosen for higher positions in industry and the services sector than men. And while more recent developments such as the introduction of a minimum wage and the establishment of social security funds have led to substantial improvements in the gender wage gap, recent data have suggested that they are still too low. According to figures in the OECD's latest Work and Income Survey from 2015, a woman earns 8.5%	0
On March 10, 2014, the Russian Federal Drug Control Service (FSKN) and the Health Care Safety Research Institute (IHR-HHSR, NNU) published the results of a study on the prevalence of opiate dependence, non-medical use of opiates, and other drug addiction among children between the ages of 10 and 12 years in Russia. These results show not only that in Russia opiate dependence and non-medical use of opiates are not common, but also that most (75.1%) Russian children between the ages of 10 and 12 had already used opiates at least once. According to statistics from the FSKN, in Russia approximately one out of five children under the age of 18 is dependent on some kind of alcohol, and about one out of five children from the age of 15 is alcoholic. Furthermore, about one in five adolescents of 15-18 years has drug addictions and is at risk of drug use disorder (e.g., alcohol and opiate dependence or use of illegal drugs). In addition, over half (54.0%) of all adolescents at risk of drug use disorders come from lower socioeconomic economic groups. Of the Russian population, approximately one-third has been arrested for a drug-related crime at least once in their life. However, in children between the ages of 10 and 12, only one-third of the children had been arrested for a drug-related crime. The prevalence of drug use disorders (alcohol dependence, non-medical use of opiates, and other drug addiction) among children in Russia is higher than in other countries. For example, in the European Union, prevalence among 10-12 year olds ranges between 22.6 and 33.6% for alcohol dependence, 2.2 - 16.9% for non-medical use of opiates, and 0.8 - 8.8% for other drug addiction. In Russia, the prevalence ranges from 12.1 - 17.4%. These statistics suggest that Russia is a higher risk country compared to other European countries. The survey on opiate use and addiction among children found that there are a number of factors that influence the likelihood of opiate abuse and addiction in children. These include: drug consumption behaviour; the way the child learns to consume drugs; peer influence; the level of drug consumption exposure; the family context; childhood experiences and the child's perception of drugs. According to the results of the survey, the frequency of opiate abuse and addiction is relatively low in many Russian children younger than 15 years, whereas children between 15 and 18 years showed an overall higher prevalence of opiate use and addiction. In fact, only one out of every thousand children younger than 15 years in Russia used opiates, while one out of every two children between the ages of 15 and 18 years, use opiates. Although there are more studies on non-medical use of opiates and other drug use among Russian adolescent drug users, little is known about opiate use and addiction among this group. The Russian Drug Control Service (FSKN) and Health Care Safety Research Institute (IHR-HHSR, NNU) conducted the study on the prevalence of opiate dependence, non-medical use of opiates, and other drug addiction among children between the ages of 10 and 12 years in Russia. Results indicate the prevalence of opiate dependence in children is relatively low in Russia's population overall, although the prevalence of dependency in Russian children younger than 15 years is at the highest level. Moreover, the prevalence of opiate addiction among Russian children younger than 15 is higher than in other European countries. Some countries in Europe have relatively fewer opiate-dependent or other drug-addicted children than in Russia, but this cannot be considered as a main cause of high rates of opiate dependence and other drug addiction in Russia since Russian children use drugs in different ways.	0
On Sunday, after months of controversy, a group of black men, women and children are expected to march through downtown Seattle on Sunday to protest police brutality. Organizers from the Seattle chapter of Black Lives Matter say the event is a show of solidarity with those killed in the recent police shooting of Charleena Lyles. The event begins with a peaceful march and protest, and organizers plan to meet with leaders of the community who disagree with their message.	0
There are some good stories that are worth hearing from the first week of free agency. A week one starting pitcher who can throw in the low 90s and be a starter instead of a reliever and a top flight starting shortstop for the Chicago Cubs are examples of that. We could go for a guy like Yoan Moncada in free agency or Justin Turner for the Atlanta Braves or Zack Cozart for the Los Angeles Angels, or there might not be a guy on the free agent market but that doesn't mean he's not worth the gamble to acquire from another team. In each of the last six years there has been a couple of players on free agents from another team who ended up proving to be great signings. Some of those players are getting new contracts signed by the original team to which they came and some of them are signing new deals for smaller multi-year contracts and some of them are still players that are worth keeping around even though they are not guaranteed to be starters. The key is that free agent acquisitions from other teams aren't often successful. For example, in 2006, the Yankees acquired Jose Iglesias from the Atlanta Braves. In the 2008 offseason the Yankees signed Carlos Beltran and Carlos Gomez from the Cleveland Indians and acquired Mariano Rivera from the St. Louis Cardinals. In 2009, the Boston Red Sox signed David Ortiz and Pablo Sandoval to five year deals with one year team options. Then in 2010, the Chicago White Sox signed Melky Cabrera and Adam LaRoche to six year, $110 million deals. And so on and so forth. You could also add Carlos Beltran and Pablo Sandoval (twice), Jose Reyes and Robinson Cano, Shin-Soo Choo and Ben Zobrist. Some of the best free agents in baseball history were acquisitions from other teams but that is not really what we want for the Boston Red Sox at this stage in the rebuilding process. We can't afford to lose two good young players for nothing. They are not starters and there is not any guarantee that they can provide us with the production that we need. They are young kids, they're young players, they can produce in multiple ways, there are no guarantees, we can't always guess, there are no guarantees of what they will do, and they are young players and young players change. The best way to learn how not to draft them is when you have them. We can't wait to take advantage of an opportunity to draft players better, we can't wait to pay more than market value for a player that will most likely be a role player with an average to below average skill set at the end of a long career. We might not wait to get what we want with the Boston Red Sox and we might not get that player from another team, but we should at least know whether a certain free agent is a good option for the redo Red Sox and if they have the ability to play in Boston. If they are a good player the Celtics should draft them and they should be on the team right away but we should at least know what kind of player we want for this rebuild in Boston.	0
The city of Boston is set to award licenses to companies that will eventually launch the Boston Bikes program, which is scheduled to launch in April of next year. The city plans to have about 50 "bike corrals" at select locations around Boston where users can borrow bikes and lock them to the curb. The goal of the Boston Bikes program is to have 700 bikes on the streets by the end of 2015. Currently only 100 bikes are available for public use. Advertisement Bike corrals were first put in place on the Red Line in the 1970s by the city of Boston to provide safe, convenient and convenient spaces for people to borrow bikes from the transit system. The Boston Bikes corral for the Green Line will be more similar to what cyclists in other cities have experienced. In the past, a corral would typically have about 18 or 20 bikes in it for free to people like students, office workers, and other people who need bikes. According to the Boston city-designated Bikes website, the corrals are designed for commuters, cyclists and pedestrians. It cites some examples of recent bicycle corrals in other cities: "In Chicago, people use corrals like this when they want to take advantage of the new on-street bike-share, CTA, buses and trains are available, and they do not want to go out of their way to find a station that has an available bike rack. People also use corrals like this when trying to return their bikes after a ride in a transit system that has bike racks, such as the Washington region's Metrorail and CTA. When these corrals were first installed in Chicago they had around 20-25 stations where people could return their bicycle. Now corrals are so full that people can only use them if they are parked a maximum of 100 feet from one another, which makes them a perfect candidate for a bike corral." Advertisement So far, about 20 bike corrals in Boston have been opened by the city-designated Boston Bikes program. The cities of San Francisco, Austin, and Seattle have also opened corrals in recent years. The bike corrals in Boston will be similar in structure to similar programs in other cities. The corrals will have at least one bike with a lock and bike racks. The bikes will have a unique color scheme that will hopefully be memorable to the people around it. Bikes could be borrowed and locked in the corrals for 30 minutes per day. Bikes will be charged an annual fee based on the distance the bicycle is traveled. These bike corrals could be used for short-distance trips downtown, to the South End or downtown Boston. Advertisement The city has set up three different levels to award licenses to companies that build bike corrals. Currently there are two tiers which were awarded to a company called BikeRescue, whose corrals are located at the Museum of Science and Industry, MIT and the Boston Commons in downtown Boston. Another company, BikeHub Inc. Inc., was awarded a three-tier license for an existing corral at South Station that will open in time for Bike the Boston Marathon in April of 2014. Companies that received the first tier licenses must complete a design assessment, which assesses the need for the corrals in Boston. Then the companies will make certain modifications to their corrals to meet the requirements. A final inspection is given by the city if the changes haven't been made. Finally, the company must submit a plan to the city explaining their plans to implement bike corrals and provide plans to have all the necessary equipment and resources in place such as a locking mechanism. They are allowed only one year to be in use before the city must start issuing a ticket to the company to begin issuing a citation. To read the full grant agreement you can head here, and see the full list of companies that have received permits to open bike corrals can be found here. (Update: the three companies receiving third stage licenses for existing corrals are the Massachusetts Bicycle Racing Association, the Boston Cyclist Union Inc., and the MassBike Foundation). Advertisement In an email to the Globe, Massachusetts Department of Transportation engineer Mike Ross said that, based on initial test runs at South Station, those corrals are likely to require minimal modifications. It remains uncertain, however, whether the city can afford to put the extra $18,000 a year into operating those corrals for 60 months. "It's not the cost of the license, it's what that license fee would be," Ross said. "If we're going to dedicate the city money on this, that money should be put to use." But in addition to the time it would take to make the modifications, the bike corrals will also need to be purchased and stored at one of the corrals once they are opened up, Ross said.	0
After the first week I would estimate that our site gets close to a million visits per day. It goes through peak traffic on Mondays and Saturdays. I can see a few hundred thousand people visiting our site during the week, I'd say we're pretty well-known in the industry as well. I do a lot of other things online, but what we do on GIGABYTE.US is where the money is on. That being said, I've been at GIGABYTE on and off for almost seven years. Before the GIGABYTE.US project began, I was known around the internet as the guy who gave free video cards to various customers. I worked at a big retail store and I started a little online game store called Digital Chaos, but it didn't get very good reviews and I wound up giving most of the business to TuxGames in 2006 (the website wasn't up yet), which was where GIGABYTE.US is a spin-off from. Since then, I've been back to school to get my MBA and work as a product manager and developer. It was through my work as a product manager that I realized how much I had learned on my own online in the past. I knew how to optimize a page for pageviews but that didn't include what users did after they arrived in your page. There was something missing. The problem is that I have had little to no experience with games. I could get it on the phone and through a console, but that was it. One day I was browsing the web. I saw how people got around in the early days of the internet. They got around through mail orders. I decided to see what mail order sites were around in the old days too. At this time the internet was still very new, so there were still lots of websites and servers back then that people used back then. They'd use them to order stuff from the post office and sometimes they'd even send money that way. Back then it was usually fairly easy to get someone (preferably not you) to do something online. I figured that mail order was the best way to get in touch with the people that were actually making the game. I'd even read that a lot of these guys had their own websites. These guys wouldn't take the phone call you sent them on a walkie-talkie, so you had to go through mailing lists. This was how I first met Paul from Digital Chaos. He had his own personal website and it was all about buying game systems online. The next problem to solve Paul was one of those people that just wanted to give the players something new, something new and unique. I thought the mail order thing was a great idea, even if it was a pain in the ass, but this email was going to blow their minds. Then he did something that blew my mind and made me realize this whole idea of making a site where people could order something online was the answer. If it was going to work and not cause any serious problems, then it was worth a shot. Paul, my mentor and mentor in many ways, thought of my mail order service as part of our development plans, not a gimmick or something that we were doing to pad our profits or create some kind of free marketing (the other companies who did mail order didn't do that, they were like my competition here I think). That made me realize that it's our site that's going to sell what we sell and that it's only natural to ask for cash. All this lead me to believe that we are the first company to actually have a mail order service that lets people sell a game system online on a personal website. And then it happened. I got an email from GIGABYTE saying they were doing mail order and that the site was in the works. I immediately had to get in touch with Paul. I emailed him and said, "Hey Paul, I guess this is a little crazy and we can't really go live, but I'd like to do some eCommerce on the web and have you create something to handle the payments and all that kind of stuff. I want this to be your baby so I can be involved. I'm sure you have lots of cool ideas but I want to help you. Can we talk about this?" Paul had such a strong sense of what needed to be done that he made me a deal. I didn't have to pay him anywhere near what he was charging other companies at that time for the same sort of service, but he was going to make sure that our mail order process would work properly. That deal made all the difference. I still remember my first day online at GIGABYTE in January of 2007. It seemed like it was over night. My inbox was flooded. People who just saw my email were asking where the site was. I was overwhelmed with so many new things. When I came online I saw that the	0
Image copyright AP Image caption Mr Trump has repeatedly said China is using the US as a "penalty" or pawn in trade disputes US President-elect Donald Trump is a "dishonest liar" who would use tariffs to force his way into China's markets, China's official news agency has said. In an article, the Global Times said Mr Trump's promise to protect American jobs is a "farce". It also suggested Mr Trump's victory showed the US "is a banana republic" - a term that originated in the 1930s. Trump Tower is in the city of Shanghai. The New York developer won the election in Tuesday's US election. "From his [Mr Trump's] campaign, it should be obvious he is a cynical opportunist and a dishonourable man," the Global Times said. Citing a recent tweet by the president-elect stating he won the popular vote but lost the Electoral College, it suggested the US was "a one-man dictatorship". "China will also watch the changes in the US. Should he push the buttons to start a trade war, he'll immediately be branded as a puppet of the big US car companies and their Chinese rivals," the article added. Image copyright AP Image caption Mr Trump promised to label China a currency manipulator during the campaign The report also argued the global economy had lost its "socialist basis", adding: "The world's most powerful nation could lose its power." The article went on to say that Mr Trump's election was a "major blow for the whole free world". "His rise in the US elections should be clearly seen as a warning from the Chinese public to their own country." Mr Trump had repeatedly said he wanted to label China a currency manipulator while campaigning for president. But on Wednesday, China's foreign minister spokesman Geng Shuang said "China never attempts to 'deter' or 'prevent' other countries from freely managing their currencies". While the global economy has been growing steadily, many economists say many countries are slowing for the wrong reasons. On Tuesday, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said trade between the EU and the US would get more difficult if Trump were to be elected. Mr Juncker said his countries would be "less competitive in the global economy and would see their economies shrink while the United States becomes even stronger". A spokeswoman for the European Commission warned that Mr Juncker's comments were not aimed at any US election party, but were aimed at countries in the European Union. A number of countries in the EU are also concerned about Mr Trump's plans to implement a "Buy American" policy and potentially impose tariffs on Chinese goods.	0
What would you do if a random person in a supermarket asked you to buy them a few litres of a cheap bottled water and then, instead of giving it back, the police pulled you away from the counter like a criminal and asked you to sign a blank piece of paper as evidence? What would you do if someone gave you a ticket for smoking a cigarette on the pavement? What if an elderly man tried to cross the street while holding a walkman in one hand and a glass with a bottle of cheap beer in the other hand? In most instances, if you're going to be ticketed for smoking or drink driving you're not going to go to court, you're going to go along with the ticket. But in Scotland, what most people don't believe is that the Scottish government can use the police to enforce a law when it didn't make them make it in the first place. I have worked in Scotland for 13 years, mainly in local government. There is a law in Scotland that if you're fined for a ticket you can be forced to cough up the fine. It has been used by the police to threaten petty offenders. For example, a couple I know were both given fines of £60 (£60 on each fine, per month) for littering. This is only a small taste of the abuse being inflicted upon the citizenry in Scotland. A recent report by the Scottish Parliament said that £1bn was lost the last 3 years of the Scottish Government as a result of the police not following up with people who'd been summonsed to court. This is £1bn which could have been used in services or social provision. But it's only for a few people who've been summonsed. And the report says that in some cases, the police refused to charge the people because they were homeless or didn't have the money. The whole system has been corrupted by the fear of being fined. These are just some of the examples of how Scottish government can use the police to enforce laws without making them. I think there's a case for all sorts of reforms to reduce the scale of policing in Scotland. But in this case it could actually be a case of a very bad law made good and a great injustice made worse. The police should not use police powers as a substitute for a good legal system The only way to change the situation is for Scotland's government to come and back the proposals of the Scottish Parliament. But Scotland only has 16 of the 53 devolved MPs. And the Scottish people have to take their decisions at an election. Some politicians in the UK have suggested that the Scottish people have to be asked to vote on this issue at the next election. This is to be expected. We have been through this in the rest of our island. People don't just vote for an individual councillor; they have to vote for their whole council or city council, etcetera, etcetera. But it is time for the UK government to back the Scottish Parliament, which has been putting forward these proposals for the past 18 months or so. The Westminster government has been talking tough on criminal justice reform and the police and prisons are now very underfunded. If Scotland cannot be trusted to set its own criminal law, then neither can it be trusted to fund criminal justice services. A police force that can't enforce the law is not a police force. That was not always the situation in Britain and in this country where you had civil servants making up their own laws and then having the rest of us enforce them. We have to rebuild the trust and the capacity of our police and the courts so that people know that there is genuine justice when they are breaking the law. Not all the time but when people are breaking the law. You might think that it is not too much to ask that when a person has been given a fixed penalty notice for parking on a footpath, that the police do a more robust checking on whether he or she has a genuine right to park there. If not, the police should not waste public money on this ticket. But because it is Scotland it is up to the Scottish Government to decide who they are going to send the parking notices to. It's not for an individual. A few months ago I had a taxi driver pull up in front of me in the street with a ticket under my numberplate. The man had told the police that we had been having phone conversations about whether I was a prostitute, and that he had written down my numberplate because he didn't want to go through this process again if we didn't actually know each other, so he needed an official document to prove this. I told the police that he had given me a numberplate and he told them that he had done so. That's his business, that's his car. But instead of taking no action he wrote a ticket under the passenger numberplate – this is ridiculous. So the police came round to the taxi and asked why I had signed this for his	0
The only way out of this mess is through the eyes of a small child. They are often the most vulnerable at the heart of a crisis because they are powerless to protect themselves. We all have an intrinsic need to be loved and loved as a child. It is the emotional connection that this basic need provides that can save us in a crisis. This is a hard truth. We can all sympathize with the little, helpless boy staring out at his world without a mother and father in sight. This post is not a call for pity or for pity politics—which have been used to delegitimize an argument for much of human history—but rather an indictment of a particular worldview that can be used to justify the death and misery inflicted on our children, often without any recognition of the damage of their existence. We need a new way to look at the world for our children. And it is not through the lens of an abstract system in an ivory tower. I am not defending the killing of children, and neither are my friends at NAP. The idea of killing a child is horrifying to most, but these same people are the first to defend the death of a person with any kind of disability, disease, trauma, aging, or severe pain. There is no question that the people who suffer the most pain and anguish in the lives of children are their caregivers—but not through "choice" but through physical and emotional abuse. "Let's not pretend that our kids have rights. They don't." This kind of attitude is a powerful weapon. It can be used to excuse child abuse and to justify the deaths of children with disabilities like Down Syndrome or Alzheimer's. They say that a child's right to live is more important than someone else's right to die. This "truly caring" is all too often used to justify child death. It takes a willful blindness to see how much misery is inflicted upon children, especially their helpless, broken-hearted, and often traumatized "little humans." It is a willful blindness that I am here to fight. What is neglect, abuse, and abuse of an older person? Disservice, abuse, and abuse of an older person is the result of a failure by a caregiver to adequately provide for a loved one. An older adult needs emotional, physical, and spiritual care as much as a child or teenager but they are still in need of care nonetheless. For this purpose, the term "disservice" refers to the acts of neglect or abuse of an older person. This definition takes into account the very real difference that older adults need in order to survive, and it is an important part of the concept of neglect. An elder's care—even if it is only "just" something you could offer to make your loved one feel better—is very much like love, and it is a very powerful thing. This is the crux of a great issue facing us: the age of care. Many older adults do not know how to care for their own needs. They get stuck in what many call the "care trap," where they are so overwhelmed that they have to rely on other adults for help. The problem is so bad that it is affecting thousands of people in nursing homes, retirement homes, and assisted living centers. In this sense, the term neglect may be applied to all people who are too frail to provide for themselves, but it is being used to describe the neglect of elders in our society more than any other age group. It is hard to explain to a child what neglect is without sounding callous, but in the context of our modern society it is a stark and devastating reality. So often, even those who do not understand what neglect is can easily see why it needs to be eliminated from nursing homes, retirement homes, and assisted living centers. This type of care is not about personal choice. It is about the social and economic system at work, where we must make a choice between paying for someone's survival and caring for ourselves. There are no other choices. We choose, not so much a caregiver's competence, but simply whether it is the right thing to do at the moment. If you or a friend are experiencing care issues at home or in another setting and wish to share your story, our helpline number is 1-800-950-7283. You may also submit a care complaint online. The bottom line is that we need a system that supports our need for care while at the same time allows us to be healthy adults with the time and energy to take care of ourselves. It is important to know that the choices we make will determine how much, if at all, our loved one will need of us—but we cannot be sure of that knowledge. We cannot wait for "healthcare," as much as we like to think of ourselves as free to make choices, and	0
Titanfall 2's servers are set to be back online by tomorrow. The original Titanfall was one of the first big name multiplayer shooters to introduce "buddy co-op" features, allowing a second player to jump in and take on an opposing trooper. Those kinds of systems are a big deal, and for fans of the previous game Titanfall 2 is a big game, with a ton to work through. Here's everything you need to know about Titanfall 2's new co-op features: What is the buddy system in Titanfall 2? Titanfall 2's Buddy System allows players to work with two other humans to take on enemy Titan pilots. How do the two human pilots cooperate? The two human pilots have an individual score, each. The two pilots have an individual score, each. They also work together in the same way humans would in regular multiplayer. By running into a Titan, or taking a Titan down with a group of players, the pilots will earn medals along the way. Will having buddy co-op work in some places? There are many different scenarios that will allow players to play either solo or with another human. The players can work together in free-for-alls, team deathmatches, or even other modes such as Last Titan Standing. How do players earn their buddy medals in Titanfall 2? Each pilot has an individual score, which is used to evaluate the teamwork. Players can earn medals by taking down enemies with a group of players, and by taking down an enemy Titan. In this way, players earn medals in different play styles to support their teammates in the field. How will Pilot Armor work? Titanfall 2 introduces new technology that improves pilots' ability to fly and survive in the field. Unlike most shooters, player health can be completely regenerated after being knocked out with a single hit, meaning players can be knocked out repeatedly and still be able to fly and have the ability to survive. Players also have new health-regen abilities called Armor Packs that can be used to refill their health over time. A couple of the new features in Titanfall 2: Grenade Launchers and Rocket Launchers Pilots can launch grenades (including mines) and rockets by pressing the X button. The Grenade Launcher has a maximum damage of 200, and rockets have a maximum damage of 300. Additionally, players with armor or shield can use these attacks in place of traditional attacks to help survive in the heat of battle. Titan Boost The Titan Boost has been improved: Pilot characters can now jump to a great height. When jumping, the Titan Boost will automatically start to slow the character just before impact, giving the pilots better positioning and positioning in a Titanfight. Once the pilot reaches the height they aimed for, they can quickly reach high surfaces by pressing the jump key again. These abilities can be useful during a titan fight when your teammates just need a little extra boost to reach a high surface quickly. GTA Online GTA Online has always had a good selection of co-op options, and now players are able to take on some of those modes with their buddies in the new Titanfall 2. If you want to take on a co-op match with your friends, there are two modes you can select: Heist and Bounty Hunter that is an online-only mode. If you haven't gotten the opportunity to try out either, check out this quick video demonstration: Co-op for GTA Online takes place in Heist and Bounty Hunter. Hip-Hop Hip-hop is the popular arcade game mode in GTA Online, and again this mode is able to be played with teammates. In both Heist and Bounty Hunter, there is a small drop zone that allows the players to take on an opposing faction during a gang battle. On the ground, each faction has unique abilities, and both teams will need to coordinate each of these abilities well if they want to survive a match. This is just a brief glimpse at some of the different modes Titanfall 2 has coming to the game. With two player co-op comes more options for co-op gameplay, and these are just the tip of the iceberg. Are you excited about co-op in Titanfall 2? What type of co-op modes are you hoping to unlock with the upcoming patch? Share your own Titanfall 2 co-op tips and tricks in the comments below!

Frequently mentioned in the press, the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter (DSF) program appears to have some key weaknesses — specifically the cost and schedule. The problems are so pervasive and seemingly intractable — they appear in recent comments made by military commanders, military leaders, and senior lawmakers. That's a serious problem because the F-35 is set to become the American Air Force's first all-conventional fighters. It's projected to cost about $400 billion — about twice the cost of building the Lockheed Martin F-35 today. And yet the F-35's schedule and cost problems are the very things that will be cited by its supporters as reasons to cancel the plane before it is ever fully combat ready, even if there are technical problems. Some critics — including the Pentagon's own top weapons tester — have said the F-35's problems are so severe that it cannot be considered safe for combat, and that the Air Force should stop designing and buying them until the flaws are largely resolved. Advertisement And yet the Air Force's own director of operational test and evaluation (DOT&E), Lt. Gen. Chris Bogdan recently said that the F-35 has "some of the most robust testing programs you could possibly have." Get Ground Game in your inbox: Daily updates and analysis on national politics from James Pindell. Sign Up Thank you for signing up! Sign up for more newsletters here So how has the F-35's problems remained hidden from the public, and the Pentagon, for so long? For starters, some of the problems are hidden in the program's own figures about how many people will be flying the F-35 by 2015. According to a summary report by the Pentagon inspector general, the F-35 Joint Program Office (JPO), one of three agencies overseeing the program, was unable to provide full and accurate financial details on its F-35 program office budget from 2010 to 2012. Because the Navy and the Air Force are doing more testing of the stealthy F-22 and its potential adversaries, respectively, the report estimated that "further cost adjustments due to reduced testing will have a greater impact on the JPO's projected final aircraft budget." The report also noted "further testing to improve mission capabilities will also add to the expected cost increases." Advertisement This last caveat is crucial. While the F-35's problems have been clear to many who have looked at them closely, the Pentagon's own top defense tester, John Butterfield, suggested in May that "at least some testing and refinement" of the plane were not needed after all. For example, the Air Force's initial certification that the F-35D could serve in "night" air defense missions last December, Butterfield pointed out, is still based on initial flight data, when the plane still has to be tested. Bogdan took this to mean the Air Force needed to conduct a second flight test by October — and have it be judged in early November as "stable and performing." Butterfield concluded that the schedule "has not changed significantly in the last year." That echoes statements made a year ago, in which he told the Boston Globe, "What we've concluded in terms of what happens in the certification is that in the short run we have not increased the schedule significantly." Bogdan, for his part, has defended his comments on cost by arguing the "F-35 represents a new kind of airplane." He has said that no major design changes are required. "The challenge is not the design, it is actually flying," he said. Nevertheless, the Pentagon's inspector general, which released one of the reports in conjunction with an audit released in early December, noted that "the testing of the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter continues to be more difficult than expected, with problems associated with key systems and with software that has been not fully tested." Advertisement That was followed up by this statement from the DOD inspector general: "Joint strike fighter development was not designed to achieve near-reliable and repeatable developmental testing." This is the latest in a series of reports from the Pentagon inspector general that have raised serious concerns about problems with the F-35's design and production. Since its initial announcement in January 2008, the F-35 program has cost over $1 trillion and is predicted to cost more than $1 trillion over the next two decades. The Air Force has asked for another $20 billion to $30 billion in savings over that same period. Congress passed a spending bill that set aside about $8.5 billion for F-35 problems — a relatively small chunk of the over $600 billion that has been budgeted in the current fiscal year. The Air Force's F-35 program office, the Joint Program Office, has argued that some of most critical problems can be solved by redesigning its	0
The U.K. has to be on the cutting edge because, for now, it's the only country where it's possible. I've had a ton of people tell me this week that the U.K. (or Australia, or New Zealand, or South Africa, or so on) should get on the cutting edge of AI. I've had them go on as if there were nothing to learn, as if these technologies do not exist and aren't here to stay. Yet there are now a multitude of people trying to get the next generation of these technologies up, running, and working. It's still early days, the applications are incredibly complicated, and the technologies are very immature. However, from where I sit it looks like we should get on, and while there haven't been a lot of examples (yet) of where this has led, in a few years we could have a really disruptive technology that doesn't exist today. The problem is that it's all about the cost of the technology. Just as the cost of the technology used in electric cars has dropped from US$40,000 to $15,000, which has resulted from the massive cost reductions achieved (for now) through battery technology and innovation in electric car batteries, it looks like we could see the cost of AI coming down even further. While there are still a lot of issues that need to be worked out before this can happen, the bottom line is there are a ton of great engineers and innovators out there working on solving these issues. Just as there are great inventors who come up with amazing ideas and make money by making it happen, too. I think the most important thing here is to remember that these technologies are already here: the algorithms, algorithms, algorithms, algorithms. We have the technology today to create autonomous systems, and the cost is only increasing by just enough that the opportunity for success is there. That said, it's all about the cost. AI needs to be affordable enough so that it can be deployed at a lower cost. The technology just doesn't exist yet, but the economics of the space are already very promising. AI is only as good as its data. The data we create to build it is critical. It is the data that enables the machine learning algorithm to function, to discover novel behavior, and to optimize solutions. For AI technology to be successful, it has to be as easy to adopt as it needs to be difficult for the adversary to build an effective counter. The first and most important thing to do is to build a data ecosystem that makes it easy for people to use (in particular for startups), because that's what's going to drive the adoption. It sounds like a cliche, but it's actually not. This ecosystem needs to be made up of many very different players. There are two primary categories of players: developers and institutions. If you're a CEO or a CTO or someone involved in an AI startup, you're not going to be involved with any organizations that are not part of a development team. Those people need to be empowered to create the data, the problems, and the solutions. This means ensuring there are great tools, APIs for data and insights, and other kinds of tools to help developers, institutions, and startups develop their own AI algorithms, tools that make that data easily accessible. This also means a focus on getting the algorithms into users hands, ensuring they're quick to learn and adaptable. Developers are going to build the solutions. This is not surprising! We've got the hardware, the software and the people, it's just a matter of putting it all together. We need to make sure that organizations and software developers are going to be able to build systems that can tackle all the problems on the grid. We've got some great resources available to help achieve this. At the moment, at least, there really aren't a lot of solutions with the complexity needed to solve this problem. This is an enormous time and money commitment for developers. If anyone is willing to take that on and make the investment, I guarantee you can see an exponential increase in the adoption of these technologies. If you're an organization that can build these solutions and is willing to hire the best of the best (developers) and work tirelessly on the problem, I bet it's going to be very difficult to come up against any major organization with an AI solution that they won't be able to defeat. If you want to do AI right (and I think you do!), let developers do the hard parts. So in summary: we have the tech. It's just a matter of making it affordable enough that it can be deployed at a lower cost. Let's do that. — We've already written a bunch on AI, and while there are a few more books or articles we've written, there are more I want to put out there: here are a couple that I think are going to be huge hits: 	0

Image copyright AP Image caption Mr Trump has been using the golf course in Scotland as a backdrop for his campaign American presidential hopeful Donald Trump has announced his Scottish partner, Aberdeen Golf Links in Ayrshire, will host the final round of the US Open. It comes as the businessman said he believed Scots would vote to stay in the UK, even though they were "much closer" to England. He is holding an event at the course on Friday before heading to Scotland. Last Friday, it was reported a letter from his Scottish solicitors would be delivered to Brexit Secretary David Davis this morning. The US Open, which was moved from the UK to New York last year, starts on Sunday. The organisers of events say they are "working hard to confirm venues and confirm dates for the 2018 event". The first round of the event, which includes the title at 13:00 local time (06:00 GMT), is being held in the afternoon. The British Open starts on Wednesday and Mr Trump is the favourite to win the tournament despite the strong protest from British golfers.	0
The FBI will be in contact with the U.S. Border Patrol later this week in Puerto Rico in order to determine if any suspected marijuana coming into the country as part of a drug interdiction on U.S. soil was being shipped through Puerto Rico, the Department of Justice's public affairs office confirmed to Reuters on Monday. In response to a Freedom of Information Act request for more details on the meeting, the Justice department said it is looking for additional information from the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which is known to be increasing its presence in Puerto Rico as part of a mission to combat illegal immigration and drug trafficking. The news about an upcoming meeting could signal a major shift in approach in the U.S. government's approach to the island, which has for decades been ravaged by poverty and crime. The U.S. island territory has a very specific role in the drug war, which seeks to interdict shipments of marijuana and other drugs by law enforcement agencies such as the FBI to the mainland as a way to put a dent in the Mexican drug trade. While such seizures are typically very large, it's a relatively rare case where drugs would be interdicted directly from the U.S. mainland to Puerto Rico. It's also somewhat remarkable that the American public would be aware of such an event, according to Dan Riffle, the director of federal policies at the Marijuana Policy Project. In the past, the case of the interdiction itself has often become much more public, Riffle said, citing how the Department of Homeland Security, which was made aware of the incident, would often hold press conferences just to inform the public. This time, there will be no such announcement to the public. Riffle said that he doesn't expect the news to have an effect on the debate over the legalization of marijuana on the island. "I think the public will probably learn it isn't a big deal and there will be no big political change," Riffle said. "It really doesn't impact the island's ability to have marijuana access and use." Still, the DOJ's announcement will likely serve as a reminder about just how difficult it is to enforce the U.S. laws against growing and selling pot in Puerto Rico, where the police force is currently underfunded and understaffed. It also underlines a point of interest shared by the federal government and the island's governor, Alejandro Garcia Padilla, who is a longtime critic of the current approach of interdiction. "For those of you who have visited Puerto Rico, you should know that it is a huge challenge to arrest and convict people here," Garcia Padilla said in a statement issued after the Justice Department was made aware of the possible incident. Still, there could be some other effects that the news will bring the island's elected officials into a greater public spotlight. Riffle said that the fact that Puerto Rico's governor and the Trump administration will be discussing their shared goals on drug policy could potentially play out in favor of the mayor of San Juan saying that she will be working closely with the U.S. government when it comes to addressing drug policy in Puerto Rico. "I think that in this case there are some things Puerto Rico needs to think about," Riffle said. "On the one hand, it's important for them to know that their administration isn't ignoring people who are using drugs, that it has resources that are available, and that it will get to people who are using drugs."	0
DETROIT (Reuters) - Two Detroit police officers were charged on Friday with murder for shooting and killing an unarmed black man in July that triggered days of rioting, looting and arson in the city's poorest African-American neighborhoods. Rochelle Clark, 44, the mother of Marvin Orr (center) and mother of the suspect, Tanisha Anderson, holds a protest sign as she waits for the charges to be read in the Detroit police shooting death of Orr, in Detroit, Michigan on October 29, 2012. REUTERS/Rebecca Cook Owen Newman and Edward Mays, who are expected to be arraigned on Monday, have not addressed the charges before. The indictment, seen by Reuters on Friday night, alleges both officers "knowingly engaged in a scheme to commit murder." Newman and Mays face a maximum sentence of life in prison if convicted of first-degree murder, said Wayne County District Court Judge Cynthia Gray Hathaway. A court reporter confirmed that bail was set at $1 million from $200,000 for all two men. Police could not immediately be reached for comment. The incident drew national attention after footage showed Officer Edward Mays shooting Orr 13 times while he fled an arrest. He was captured minutes later and died the same day. In what prosecutors said was a ploy to justify their actions, both the Detroit Police Department and union representing officers at the time have denied Orr was resisting arrest. Orr's relatives have insisted they believe Orr was unarmed and was just trying to get away as his partner, Orman, tried taking his gun, which was found next to his body. The charges against Orr bring the total number of defendants in the case since July 25 to nine. Five of the nine defendants were initially charged on Thursday, though each eventually pleaded not guilty on each of the eight charges filed on Friday. On November 22, four officers - including Orman - were each convicted of assault and sentenced to probation or house arrest with electronic monitoring, after a judge said the incident was an assault on citizens rather than the police. Orr's family have said they still believe the officers committed a crime.	0
The White House on Monday issued a new policy directive outlining the steps it has taken in efforts to prevent gun violence in the United States as well as its plans to fight terrorism in the wake of the Islamic State's gruesome beheading of 21 Egyptian Christians. Speaking hours after a shooting, a statement from the White House said the administration had "made it a top priority to stop gun violence in this country, and to do this in a way that recognizes the unique risks faced by law enforcement officers and the families they serve." The directive, however, did not refer to guns as a threat to national security and is focused on preventing terrorism. The document did note the threat posed by domestic terrorism, including "acts of domestic terrorism," which include the killing of law enforcement officers or others, "criminal or unlawful threats" resulting in bodily harm or death, or those involving international terrorism. "Since 9/11, our nation has been united in supporting and protecting the rights of Americans to be able to protect themselves, to use firearms to protect their families, and to protect their communities," the directive says. "All Americans have an inherent right to feel safe in their homes and in their communities." JUST WATCHED Police: Man in U.S. over ISIS call from Egypt Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Police: Man in U.S. over ISIS call from Egypt 01:55 President Barack Obama said Saturday that the killing of a Christian Egyptian Coptic woman in an incident in northern California was a particularly "heinous" reminder of the need to confront the threat posed by extremists and the "evil they represent." "It's an outrage that this happened," Obama said. He acknowledged that the United States needed to do a better job of keeping guns out of the hands of known criminals and mentally unstable individuals. But he offered no public explanation for the policy directive and a U.S. official said it was not a response to the video showing the horrific murder of the Coptic Christians. "The White House is not commenting on specific videos," an administration official said. On Monday, it emerged that the video was posted on a social network used by a member of ISIS, a militant group based in the Sinai peninsula. The official said the administration did not have a direct link to the video, though "we do know that some extremist groups around the world have sought to depict what transpired as part of their recruitment campaigns, in their various languages," the official said. "They certainly will try to make clear that they're doing it for one reason, to attract attention," the official said. The killings have prompted protests worldwide and prompted the White House to ramp up counter-terrorism efforts both at home and abroad, including more U.S. airstrikes in Syria and Iraq. On Tuesday, Obama announced plans to create 10 new U.S. military drone bases. The new bases, including bases in South Carolina and Florida, will also help protect U.S. military personnel, embassies and other U.S. facilities in foreign countries to "make their own operations safer," said White House spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden.

MUST WATCH Coptic activist: 'This is about freedom, no matter your faith' 02:02 But with ISIS claiming responsibility for the gruesome death of the Egyptian Christians, Obama's declaration of a "national emergency" on terror did not necessarily constitute an expansion in presidential authority. The Constitution's "special powers" allow the president to declare emergencies during an ongoing war for public protection, and to call to mobilize militia to protect citizens and U.S. interests, the U.S. State Department said. "A national emergency declared under any of the authorities listed in section 401(b)(2) may be invoked only by the President, or by the President's designee, for such period as he or she deems necessary to overcome an emergency declared by him or her or to protect the public safety," a statement from the State Department said. The White House said Obama was still reviewing how to protect U.S. citizens and American facilities worldwide after the video showing the slaying emerged in the aftermath of Saturday's massacre at a Coptic Catholic cathedral in Egypt. The White House has not identified the countries represented in the 10 new drone bases but officials are discussing other locations, some of which have been in the works for years and did not receive prior scrutiny, a U.S. official said. Officials indicated the U.S. was still in the process of identifying those countries, but said it would be "premature" to indicate whether any countries had been selected. Obama signed an executive order more than a week ago creating a special effort at the Department of Homeland Security and the Justice Department to prevent citizens from being radicalized.

MEXICO CITY -- A Mexican man has been arrested on suspicion of raping a 19-year-old woman on the city's main shopping street on a weekend night. The victim, a college student, says she was followed by someone in an open car, and followed in a private motorbike. "I walked across the street and I was followed at speed (down Mexico City's main shopping avenue) in front of a hotel called 'Casa Marina' by an older man in a green BMW," she told reporters Monday, her nose bleeding from the attack. The victim says she was walking through the middle of the road on Friday in an open car to get to a friend's place when a man started following her as she ran to meet up with her friend. READ: Murder investigation into possible abduction and rape in Mexico "I decided to cross the road, and it was then he approached me. He had a black suitcase on his back. I felt afraid," the victim said. She says she tried to run, but she kept going at a much faster pace because she knew the path would take her to where her friend's apartment was. She says she was afraid to go back the other way, but decided to go through the pedestrian area instead. WATCH | Woman who said she was attacked on Mexico City's main avenue arrested The victim said she was attacked in front of a hotel called Casa Marina, on the main mall of Mexico City. The victim told reporters there was no surveillance camera in the area, and she believes her assailant might have been a stranger to everyone there. "I couldn't believe it when I saw the suitcase and the man following me. The attacker took control of both of my arms and I couldn't think straight," she said. WATCH: Man found guilty in Mexican student's rape She's now in the hospital with a broken nose and broken bones in her face and neck and is recovering. She says she can't go to work, and she will be on painkillers for the rest of the week. A nurse who saw the injuries told her the attacker is a foreigner. Authorities believe there may be more victims because the victim was followed from the Casa Marina hotel to the Plaza Moneris. She said she wasn't sure where the motorbike pulled her home and it's possible people have fled the scene. READ: 'I'm afraid to go back to my own apartment because I'm afraid to find the body': Mexico student Police are saying that the investigation doesn't seem to be related to terrorism, but that the investigation is currently in its early stages. The victim says she doesn't trust police who initially arrested the suspect. Police said they have launched an investigation into possible robbery or kidnapping and a possible hate crime. WATCH: What the 'Day of the Dead,' or Dia de los Muertos, really means This type of crime is extremely rare in Mexico City, according to Carlos Vazquez, head of municipal security. "It's a terrible crime, especially for a young female who might have a boyfriend, or maybe she's doing something she shouldn't do, or maybe she didn't get in her car or got in a car that wasn't her car. It's very much disturbing," Vazquez said. Municipal police said Monday this is the first case of its kind they've encountered. The victim said she met a man online and they met several times to have dinner. She said they've been seeing each other for a few months. The victim said she has a boyfriend and they are planning to get married, but she has decided not to go to a wedding because she's scared of what might happen. RELATED: Students say Mexico is becoming more dangerous The victim's family moved her to another apartment in the capital and they have to make a new plan for her as she spends every moment at the hospital. "She is going to stay with her parents, but I hope it's for one week so she can recover," the victim's cousin Maria del Carmen said. It's believed that a man was traveling with the victim in the car that night of the attack. Police have asked residents of the area to be on the lookout for the suspect. Meanwhile, the victim's parents are looking for help. They say she has a very bad feeling about what happened and they'll try to find and support each other in any way they can.	0
HONG KONG — It took five years for the latest government-initiated reforms, the latest crackdown from China's top diplomat, to finally reach Hong Kong's leaders. As it turns out, they're not all happy about it. On Tuesday, after nearly three weeks of negotiations, the Hong Kong government announced the details of two proposed national security laws that Beijing plans to push through with its local representatives before the end of the year. In essence, the laws would allow security authorities to monitor the activities of Hong Kong and Chinese citizens outside the city through broad powers of surveillance. Hong Kong, an autonomous place, has enjoyed significant autonomy in domestic policy making for the past 17 years. But the laws could severely limit the freedoms of the next Hong Kong leadership, and there's no guarantee that the new leadership would be willing to grant Beijing so much new power. After all, as the Chinese government has been increasingly aggressive toward the city in recent years, Hong Kong's government has become increasingly wary of its responsibilities, said James Leung, the head of law firm Kowloon S.C., which advocates free speech in Hong Kong. "This is just the latest step to push us back," Mr. Leung said. "Hong Kong has shown an increasingly defiant attitude over the last several years." In June 2008, for instance, China accused two high-profile Chinese human rights lawyers of working as foreign agents — a designation usually reserved for political activists — and sought their arrest. The Chinese authorities then detained the lawyers for more than 13 months, claiming that they were "under the control" of foreign agents. The detainees never denied they worked for lawyers, but Beijing denied that they actually were — at least publicly. "Hong Kong had a lot of people like [those lawyers] who stood up for the rights of human rights," said Leung. "Now, they're all in prison." The law that Mr. Leung describes would have a major impact in China. Beijing controls about 90% of Hong Kong's commerce, and the vast majority of its companies are Chinese government-owned, which limits the territory's ability to push back against Beijing. The law, by restricting the ability of government officials to monitor domestic activity, would further restrict the ability of Beijing to monitor foreign entities and individuals on Hong Kong soil — as well as the ability of Hong Kong people to see or communicate with mainland Chinese in any way they choose. And though the law doesn't explicitly mention the Chinese leadership or its members, it's impossible not to interpret it this way. Mr. Leung said the idea behind the law is that "politically sensitive information will be restricted," and that government activities would be "controlled or monitored." There's no indication in the statement from Hong Kong's government — issued on Tuesday and published only on Monday — that the laws are intended to monitor or control domestic political activity. But the wording is reminiscent of language the Chinese government has used in recent years when targeting the rights of Uighur refugees living in the region. In October last year, Beijing approved new national security laws that give security authorities more broad powers to monitor and surveil all citizens. Those authorities have broad discretion to grant people and organizations access to information about their personal affairs when deemed necessary. The new laws are currently undergoing public consultations. Hong Kong's government, meanwhile, has not been able to implement the laws until January, or so far anyway. It may be years before Hong Kong's legislation becomes fully implemented, Mr. Leung said. The two proposed national security laws, if approved, would come amid increasing tension between China and Hong Kong. First, there's the matter of Hong Kong's 2017 presidential election — which will play out with less drama now that a key Beijing-appointed committee has approved the candidates. The committee will select two of Hong Kong's three pro-Beijing candidates in the vote. (The other is one nominated by a major pro-democracy political party, which the committee chose not to include.) But Hong Kong's new pro-democracy chief executive, Leung Chun-ying, was not included in the committee's initial list. Some pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong were infuriated by that decision, calling it an attempt to remove Leung from the race. A day after he was excluded from the initial list, Leung was allowed to run for the top spot — a decision that sparked widespread protests across the city. The pro-democracy movement has held weekly demonstrations calling for Leung's removal, with over 4,000 people turning out each week, according to Hong Kong police. One of the leaders of that movement is Joshua Wong, a 17-year-old pro-democracy activist from student activist group Scholarism, who has just entered a new high school this fall. "The decision to exclude Leung Chun-ying is a big problem. … You can't just take away our rights without a fight	0
"What was the reason for the attack upon us?" asked one of his party-mates on Saturday. "Why did they attack us? These are questions I ask myself. We are at war. We are on the road to war." The first two rounds of the war against Isis-held Mosul were more or less a war of attrition on the ground, with Isis attacking Iraqi security forces in densely populated areas. When the Iraqi Special Forces and police managed to advance towards the eastern suburbs of the city, they were attacked from both sides, with the latter launching a powerful counter-attack. As the battle was underway, Isis reportedly launched a car bomb at the security forces, killing at least 15. Some of the victims were reportedly children, though many of the dead were believed to be Iraqi police or army. The army is trying to verify the figures. It was then that the city's residents began to flee to the countryside, where they were caught in the crossfire between the two sides. The government has been trying to enforce a heavy curfew since the militants' last assault on Mosul, after which locals were able to safely return. When the Iraqi forces tried to tighten the noose, they found few if any of their fellow citizens were willing to stay in the city. They were scared not of imminent death but of being locked up without food, medicine or blankets. "We had our own houses, cars, everything," said one Mosul resident. "Then Isis came and took them away." As Iraqi forces began to close in on the east side of the city, the city's residents began to fear a full-scale war would engulf them. While Isis's advance was halted over the weekend, the extremists still held the upper hand. "They have destroyed everything," said a Mosul resident who escaped the city. "Their snipers are everywhere. The streets are a war zone and they are ready to shoot at anyone and anything." One of his two sons went into the countryside with him, leaving their mother alone with their daughter. She was unable to flee with them because of the shelling of her house.

The United Kingdom has joined the United States in urging its citizens not to go to Syria but if they do it should be for strictly humanitarian reasons, Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond said on Friday. Mr. Hammond was speaking at a meeting with the United States' ambassador to the United Kingdom David Miliband in London on Friday. "I am concerned that people who are interested in travelling to Syria to join the civil war there are doing so for purposes other than helping the people of Syria," Mr. Hammond said. Mr. Hammond said those who had left Britain to fight in Syria had not engaged, trained or given humanitarian aid to the Syrian people. "We hope the British people will do the rest of us a great favour and not get involved in that sort of nonsense," he said. Mr. Miliband said that Britain was also worried by reports that Syria has a chemical weapons program. "We have every reason to believe that Syria has some military capabilities, even if it cannot yet use them," he said. Britain has been taking steps to strengthen its defenses, including putting into place new military training courses. A year-long civil war in Syria began in March 2011 when the government of Prime Minister Hafez al-Assad was violently removed from power. At least 70,000 people have died. The conflict has also spilled over into neighboring Iraq.	0
Newton has a penchant for doing the unexpected, and even more so than he did this summer, with his second half surge in the MVP race. What do the Golden State Warriors do when they get a steal, an incredible basket, a moment of greatness or one of the most spectacular plays in playoff history? They do something extraordinary: They go for it again or take one of the best shots in recent NBA history. Golden State did just that late Saturday night, when the Warriors took advantage of a breakaway to take out the Denver Nuggets in double overtime and win the NBA Championship 105-99. It was the type of play that the Warriors do not often get, at least not on national TV. WATCH: Warriors defeat Nuggets on D-Wade's big shot The play may not have been the type of shot in the playoffs that gets the attention, but you can't really expect the Warriors to have a routine performance, can you? So when Curry took the ball from Curry and fired a ball that went in at the buzzer, it might have felt as if the Finals had turned into an exhibition. But there wasn't any pretense. The play was part of an eight-minute run of three consecutive Golden State buckets in the fourth quarter that set up that play that put the Warriors ahead 105-99. The Warriors led 109-102 with 1:06 left in the fourth on a 20-foot, fadeaway jumper by Andre Iguodala off of a pass from Klay Thompson with 7:24 left. Things didn't get any better for the Nuggets. In the following 1:20, the Warriors had an open-look 3-pointer from Curry's right hand, but Klay Thompson was knocked out of the game a few seconds later with an apparent leg injury. Iguodala missed a runner with 14.8 seconds to go, and the Warriors scored the final seven points of the period to win. It was the type of play that the Warriors do not often get, at least not on national TV. But you can't really expect the Warriors to have a routine performance, can you? So when Curry took the ball from Curry and fired a ball that went in at the buzzer, it might have felt as if the Finals had turned into an exhibition. But there wasn't any pretense. The play was part of an eight-minute run of three consecutive Golden State buckets in the fourth quarter that set up that play on a breakaway by Stephen Curry late in double overtime that tied the game at 105-105. What if the play had not been the steal and the 3-pointer was not the 3-pointer? That game would never have ended. It is just one of those crazy plays that happens in the NBA. Stephen Curry finished with 33 points on 10-20 shooting to lead the Warriors. For Denver, J.J. Hickson finished with 19 points while Ty Lawson had 17 for the Nuggets. What do you think of this play? Did the Warriors pull a prank by having Curry take the ball and play a two-man game on a fast break?	0
Polls from last week show that over 4 in 10 Americans believe the nation will be stronger should it ratify the treaty, but they are just three to four points more likely to vote yes than no, giving the campaign a slight edge in support from independents. If ratified, the treaty would represent a significant shift in power and jurisdiction from countries to the United States, potentially altering federal law, the rule of law and national security. The treaty will likely have to undergo public debates in the coming years as politicians across the United States discuss the implications of its provisions for domestic and international law. This week, our friends at the National Journal weighed in, noting the many benefits and potential downsides of ratifying the treaty. In addition to being a big deal for the United States, the treaty would allow America to more easily monitor the use of U.S. troops and resources in other nations. While it does not give the United States the power of force, it would give American citizens a clear idea of when and how their tax dollars and international aid to a foreign country ends. It would also require countries to make major transparency and accountability changes as well as provide an annual report to Congress on human rights and civil liberties. Here are some more facts from the article about the treaty. One of the most important parts of this treaty are its transparency provisions, which would require member nations to make public any information that may be used to investigate violations of human rights laws or other laws of the treaty's signatories. These provisions would allow members of the public to see exactly how the United States or other members are using funds appropriated by Congress and how a country in that country is performing on human rights. There is an added bonus for Americans: if it's ratified, the UN will no longer be responsible for administering the U.S. domestic human rights laws such as the Freedom of Access to Information act and the Electronic Communications Privacy Act. These laws are overseen by the U.S. government and will remain so under a ratified treaty. Another added benefit for Americans: under this treaty, American taxpayers will no longer have to provide human rights fund payments to a UN human rights body. Instead, Americans will be able to keep this money on their domestic financial assets and will then not have to pay taxes on the money earned from the transfer of funds. Ratifying this treaty will allow the United States military to have legal jurisdiction in some of these nations — the U.S. will no longer have to send troops from the United States to defend civilians in the country. And when a U.S. servicemember is hurt in foreign countries, including from the use of military force, the U.S. will no longer be responsible for paying medical bills. Another big reason to support Obama's decision to ratify this treaty is that it would allow the U.S. to better monitor aid and money that it helps with. Because so much of the money is fungible and the U.S. can keep track of how much of the money that goes to foreign countries is actually going to help those people, it will be easier to track and verify the use of military funds. In addition, ratifying the treaty will give American taxpayers better knowledge at a time when the world economy needs more transparency and accountability from government. The U.S. would be a better place to do business and for trade and investment, as American companies will no longer be held responsible if their countries violate human rights laws that they are expected to abide by. Here's an infographic to show you how a ratified UN treaty could affect American's law.	0
As the U.S. embarks on a military campaign against the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) militants, it needs a robust intelligence-gathering network that is strong enough to keep tabs on terrorist organizations operating in the West, President Obama said Wednesday. "We certainly need a very high level of cooperation, especially within Europe, between intelligence services, between military and civilian authorities, between law enforcement and regulatory agencies and business networks," the White House press secretary said during a news briefing at the White House. However, "we are not talking about 100,000 [officers] right now," Carney added, although that's a target the United States wants to achieve. According to the U.K. Guardian newspaper, a senior U.S. intelligence official says "the United States needs 50,000 to 100,000 active-duty intelligence personnel across Europe to monitor the continent's jihadist movement." According to a Pentagon report, the U.S. military is already on track to reach Obama's goal within the next three weeks. Carney said the U.S. is pursuing that effort through various avenues, including direct intelligence-sharing, partnering with foreign countries, and working in partnership with civil intelligence services. "So the bottom line is we need to have in place the proper intelligence infrastructure to deal with terrorists, just as we need to have the relevant capabilities in place to defend this nation, and all of the folks in the region," Carney said. U.S. officials say U.S. intelligence networks will be "vital," but they are also working on developing new strategies to counter the terrorist threat.	0
Somewhere in the world, a young woman is being raped on a daily basis in the name of God and Allah. That is precisely the view of a radical Muslim cleric in Bangladesh. This is the first time a non-majority religious organization has called for Islamic law to be applied in an Islamic country and the woman in question, an advocate for religious freedom, is being punished as a result. According to Bangladesh Observer, the victim, Mahfuzul Islam, is a member of the All Bangladesh Women's Front (ABWF), a group calling for a ban on Muslim marriages, the conversion of non-Muslims to Islam, and the death penalty for apostates. When asked why she doesn't submit to the husband's demands, Mahfuzul is said to have replied "In the name of Allah, I am not going to marry that man…and if I am going to submit to him, I am not going to submit to death penalty." It goes on to say that Islam gives "the man the right to decide what woman he wants to marry." However, when a Muslim man, married to a Hindu woman or a Christian woman, wants to marry a woman of another religion, such person is said to be "deviated" and "unbelieving," and "should be killed, tortured [or] thrown into hell." Mahfuzul's words are being used to justify Sharia law, which states that if a woman's husband does not find an acceptable match for her, then "he may kill her, or he may punish her, or he may divorce her, or he may enslave her, or he may force her into marriage." This is what the group is proposing in Bangladesh, but Mahfuzul and her fellow women's rights activists, according to Bangladeshi newspaper The Daily Star, are being labeled "deviant" and "unbelieving" by other Muslims due to their "lack of belief." To be fair, one doesn't have to be devout Muslim to call for Islamic law to be applied in the West in order to maintain the religious freedoms guaranteed by the Western legal system. In fact, in the Netherlands, the Islamic courts have ruled that a man, in the middle of a marriage when he becomes sick and desires to divorce his wife, can force the woman in question in front of the religious tribunal to agree to "woo the husband with an immaculate wife," or have her wife legally recognized as his property. But Bangladesh isn't a modern, modern country, and the fact remains that many Muslim women in that country who have spoken out against the atrocities of Islam are being subjected to brutal and brutal punishments in the name of the religion. And so, while her fellow activists and many Muslims may call in good faith for religious law to be applied to Bangladeshi law, one must wonder: if such laws had been in place in the United States, what would have happened to Mahfuzul Islam? Her life may have been a living hell, but she is not alone. A recent report from the U.S. State Department warned U.S. citizens in Bangladesh of "dangerous religious extremism." As a result, many Americans are afraid to venture to the Muslim-majority country. In response, Bangladesh's minister of information and broadcasting, Shahriar Alam, said recently during an English language interview in the country's English daily The Daily Star that Bangladeshis have "no problem" with Westerners or tourists visiting Islam's holiest cities in Mecca and Medina, but "we cannot allow people to visit the birthplace of the Prophet who married a 6-year-old and he died at 39." This comes from a man who is not only responsible for enforcing Sharia law but who has been promoting Islamic supremacist ideology since he was a child. He appears to be the perfect leader for Islam's extremist movements in Bangladesh, and he should be the one who would be held up as an example of what happens when women are victims of religious law.	0

This is not my deck. It is what I learned through the last two seasons, playing against opponents who were so close to playing their best deck. I made some minor adjustments to the deck last night and I think it's better than ever! This deck is designed to punish your opponent for playing a non-legendary class like hunter or warrior by drawing them out, setting up big board clears, and destroying them. The deck focuses on two things: A) Making quick, aggressive plays, B) Building up a board with minions that help you finish the game quickly and efficiently, For A, this includes: -Fury Swipes and Charge, -Savage Roar, -Mountain Giant, -Killer Klown, -Bite, -Amani Berserker, -Dire Wolf Alpha, -Gang Up and Charge, -Charge, -Fury Swipes while facing aggro, -Kronroh, -Shield Slam, -Unstable Ghoul, -Kobold Geomancer, -Sunkeeper Tarim, -Argent Squire, The deck makes use of cards like Kill Command, Kill Command, and Deadly Poison to help clear out enemies out of the game. Against B, the deck relies on a mixture of minions and weapon cards to finish off and overwhelm your foes. To start off, let me say that I feel like this is one of the strongest and most fun decks I've ever played. Let me explain: First, I have to thank HEXTCGplayer.com that I've met them through their website and I feel like I've gotten to know them a lot more through this forum. They took the deck concept and ran with it and taught me quite a bit. Also, before my initial run, I had played a version of this Deck on the website where the deck had 6-8 minions on board at the beginning. After running a few matches and learning the deck and the combos, I noticed that I was never able to finish a game before my opponent drew their entire deck. I'm sure there must have been a good reason to do this, but I don't want to jump to any conclusions. The game is always changing and with an extremely high win rate of close to 55%, I am confident that they did it to punish you for playing the non-legendary class. Now that I've changed the list drastically, I have the following changes: -Removed 1 Deadly Poison -Removed Kill Command -Added Kill Command, 2 Shadowsteps -Added Acolyte of Pain -Updated card backs All of the above was done by me and I made sure to test and adjust each step I made. After the deck worked out, I then did a quick search to find other people who ran the deck and posted their thoughts. Since I am quite experienced, I decided to go up to 3 Shadowsteps, 2 Kill Command, 2 Acolyte of Pain, and 2 Arkenstone. Here my main changes to the list: -Removed a 2-drop -Removed Acolyte of Pain -Removed Kill Command -Removed 2 Kill Commands -Removed Arkenstone -Removed 2 Killer Knocks -Removed Acolyte of Pain -Removed Assassinate -Removed Shadowstep And this is how the deck looked after running all of my adjustments. I do realize that there may be more than one play you can make to optimize the deck for you. My advice then would be to adjust the core of the deck so that you are only playing one Kill Command. I hope you all enjoyed this deck and I wish you all the best. I'll update this deck as I play more games and adjust.	0
The most recent poll showed Trump at 33 percent — his worst showing yet. Many of his supporters are expressing a lack of confidence in the candidate's ability to lead the nation. "We've been talking about how bad he is and how terrible he is, and that's only after [Clinton and Trump] have been in office," says Della Valle, 44, a registered Republican who supports Trump. "They are just not ready." Others see more possibilities for Clinton's defeat. She has had her own bump, but not the kind Trump supporters cite. She would still defeat Trump, the majority of pollsters say. "She would probably be the worse person to be president, probably, by a long shot," says Patrick Caddell, an independent pundit widely published on network television. But Caddell and other forecasters — including the nonpartisan FiveThirtyEight political newsletter — do not think she would take the presidency. "Even in a world in which it's very close, she doesn't have a good shot in a landslide," Caddell says. In recent weeks, Clinton has had her highest-profile rallies and was the subject of a new ad from her running mate, Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., on television. But other Clinton events haven't boosted her popularity. A Monmouth University poll on April 7-11 found that just 16 percent of voters would be more likely to vote for a candidate who is viewed favorably by the news media. In a CNN/ORC International Poll two days earlier, just 11 percent said they felt a lot closer to casting their ballot for Clinton while 60 percent were leery of it. Her unfavorable numbers were even higher, at 41 percent. "The numbers that she's being tested in by the media are far, far higher than anything her numbers were prior to this campaign," says Larry Sabato, director of the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia. Trump and his aides have claimed that their rallies have drawn more people to the polls in recent weeks. But the polls do not support this claim. A Monmouth survey in late March found that the rallies that drew the most people to the polls weren't in swing states where Clinton often barnstorms: Georgia, Florida and North Carolina. Instead, the rallies that drew the highest poll numbers, like those by Trump and his own supporters, tend to be in states that he needs to win in order to win the presidency. The poll shows that Trump's supporters are not only disaffected with the Obama administration but also with the economy. In that same Monmouth poll, 50 percent of Trump supporters had an unfavorable view of the country's economy, compared to 33 percent who said favorable. In March, a Gallup poll found that 55 percent of those who voted for Trump in the Republican primaries viewed the economy negatively, while 30 percent were optimistic that the economy would improve in the future. "They're not looking for a better America," Caddell says of Trump's loyal supporters. "They want to see America succeed." At Trump's campaign rallies this week, supporters often express the same sentiments. "I'm a lifelong Democrat, but I voted for Donald Trump because he's a businessman and a man of action and he's got the experience, he's got the grit for this job and he's going to make good decisions," says John Anderson, 72, a retired truck driver wearing an America-themed cap and a T-shirt with his face on the back. Anderson is among many who say that a Clinton win could harm their lives. "The country that I live in is really going down the toilet," Anderson says, echoing a theme that many of the pollsters' interviews uncover. "It's a lot of people are getting poorer and the rest are getting poorer. And things are getting worse and worse."	0

On Saturday a large crowd of protesters turned out at the Republican debate in New Hampshire over the killing of James Foley by Islamic State militants. One of them was John McElroy, a freelance photojournalist from New York who had been reporting for CNN. Mr McElroy, who was wearing a CNN T-shirt that read "American Hero," was detained by State Department security after his press pass apparently was found at the event. The State Department, however, released a statement saying the journalist was not detained or prevented from getting on to a plane to go back to his home in New York City. It says that Mr McElroy was detained when he was about to be flown home. "However, he was not escorted to the airport. He was not asked to produce his credentials or undergo any security screening," the statement said. The statement went on to say that Mr McElroy had not broken any laws and that his press accreditation was valid. Mr McElroy has been working as a freelance correspondent since 2005 and has won awards for his work. At a speech at the debate on Saturday, Mr Trump said Mr McElroy was "very proud of his heritage." The President-elect said that "if somebody said it was not, they would have never picked him for the Middle East" - a reference to the conflict between the Palestinian Authority and Israel. "I want news media that represent our civilisation, not one that's got a different political viewpoint than a reporter from the other side." A White House press briefing later on Saturday was scheduled to be held by Mr Trump's press secretary, Sean Spicer. "The president expects to hear from the press corps. He expects to have a lively and robust briefing," Mr Spicer said.	0

Facing mounting allegations of rape against Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, former Miss Universe Alicia Machado said she was "victimized" by Trump while he was in power, despite his claims on the campaign trail that he did not sexually assault her. "I was an innocent victim… He could have stopped it," Machado said in an appearance Sunday on CBS's "Face the Nation." "He should have said, 'She did not attack me.' I could have stopped it, but he chose not to. What were you thinking to run this pageant? I ran this pageant to be like America's beauty queen, I wanted to be like a super model, something like that. I wanted to break all records. When he saw me he smiled." On Friday, The Washington Post released audio and written descriptions of several women, who accused Trump of making inappropriate advances and unwanted sexual contact. Machado, an award-winning Miss Universe in 1996 at age 23, said Trump threatened to ruin her career after she refused his advances. "He just ripped [my] arm away from me," Machado said. "He was laughing. No, he was shaking, laughing. He just twisted my arm. It's like – I saw him moving all around in my body." Machado said that she thought Trump was on to another sex assault victim because the former reality TV star is not the type of person to attack people in public and said he has not been accused of anything like that before. "He's an arrogant, greedy man," Machado said. "He has that kind of body… He should not be a part of this organization." Machado also said she found Trump attractive and he invited her to his house. She was "in shock," she said, and thought, "'I cannot be raped by him or be a victim of him.'" Machado had earlier told CNN's Anderson Cooper that she did not "belive that he did not rape me" since "he already did a lot, in front of my eyes, and I was already humiliated."	0

A Florida man who was charged with animal cruelty for killing a cat with a lawnmower, then driving several miles to kill the cat's owner was sentenced Thursday to a year of probation. William J. Haug was convicted May 7 after a month-long trial in Palm Beach County Circuit Court of one count of animal cruelty and two counts of driving with a suspended or revoked license in connection with the May 16, 2010, killing of a female bobcat on a residential street near Boca Raton. According to the Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office, Boca Raton police received reports that a man had fatally maimed his cat on a residential street in the village of Boca Raton. The owner told police the cat had clawed and beheaded itself in the yard of a home. He said he had placed the cat outside his home for several days and allowed it out into the yard several times a day so it would not be afraid. Police took the cat to a local animal clinic to be examined but the animal did not survive. Police learned that the cat had sustained numerous injuries consistent with being mauled by a large urban cat, an animal expert testified during trial. Boca Raton police, Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service officials conducted a six-month investigation of Haug.

The U.S. Justice Department has—for the first time—made it illegal to lie repeatedly about your income in response to a federal tax assessment. The new rule, signed last month, does not apply to Social Security income and is a far cry from a "no income" campaign. But by making it illegal to lie with your income, the Obama administration was putting more power in the hands of ordinary citizens. Here's how it works: If the IRS asks for some information about where you work, you will have to respond honestly. If you falsely claim your income as "independent contractor" and don't work at all, you could be slapped with a hefty $3,000 fine and up to five years in prison. This is a major victory for taxpayers. Most of us have lived with the threat of this audit of our finances for as long as I have owned a mortgage. And even as we've fought for years to get it abolished or cut back for the sake of the taxpayer, not a single reform has been made. Taxpayers have already begun suing over this new law, but it still has to withstand a challenge before the U.S. Supreme Court. But with the Obama administration's encouragement, all this litigation could make a comeback. As a former mortgage attorney, I've become a bit of a tax policy wonk. I've always thought that people should be allowed to falsely claim certain types of income under the tax code, as long as it wasn't an attempt to hide some sort of criminal activity. After all, if someone is honest about having no income from any source, as they should be, that means they're being "innocent." And when people who are honest about their finances are also being "innocent" of tax avoidance, there is far less to worry about. Indeed, if honest taxpayers are the least of our problems, then what's the problem with tax avoidance? Why should anyone be worried about it?	0
"It was a nice run - I don't know that people will want to watch it again just because of the incident," he said. Mr O'Neill said he did not want to press charges against Ms Kelly, saying he was "not going to start something like a witch-hunt". Ms Kelly, from Finglas, north Dublin, was last year awarded an OBE by the Queen. It would have been her first decoration when she was awarded the medal in 2002. She won a number of awards over several years before winning an MBE for services to the Irish film industry in 2013. The decision to award her an OBE was a significant one, as it recognised her work as a film producer, as well as her contributions to the Irish film industry. Ms Kelly had been due to retire from acting in Dublin on February 5, but the decision means that she will stay in the city up to her 75th birthday. Irish Independent	0
The new iPad has taken its place as the biggest-selling tablet for Apple, which is now on track to top iPad sales of its previous two iterations, the fourth-generation iPad and the second-generation iPad. At least that's what Macquarie Securities analyst Peter Misek says in his note to clients today, published after Apple's quarterly earnings call yesterday. According to his estimates, the new iPad was Apple's top selling product in the country in the month of April, selling more than one million units in the quarter. That's a significant leap from his earlier predictions in late February, when he said the new iPad would only sell about 350,000 units during the March quarter. It's worth noting that Apple doesn't break out iPhone sales by country, but MacQuarie says iPhone sales in April are off only about 2 percentage points from a year ago, suggesting Apple has still not lost its foothold on mobile. The iPad is the best-selling tablet Apple has ever sold, MacQuarie writes, but there's still room for growth. The company expects the new iPad to sell 200,000 units in Apple's remaining fiscal year, which begins in November. That leaves Apple ahead of its competitors in tablets, and still ahead of the industry, as long as demand doesn't start to slow. The company sold 12.5 million iPads in the March quarter, beating analyst expectations for 10 million units. But it was a pretty solid second quarter for tablets overall -- the sector only managed sales of 5 million in the March quarter, and 10 million in the April quarter. At the same time, sales of Macs dipped, while iPad sales continued to surge. Apple sold 9 million Macs in the quarter -- and 11.54 million since the new iPad was announced -- a jump of 2.2 million over the previous fiscal quarter. That's about the same amount it sold the previous June, and it suggests Apple had a solid second quarter overall on the back of surging demand.	0
For some parents, the thought of sending their child off to war may never be a possibility. It's a sobering thought at some times, especially these days when everyone seems so sure the world is just in a state of perpetual crisis. It's also important to remember that war comes with a certain degree of collateral damage, and that those who died or suffered serious physical or emotional harm may have been innocent victims of an unjust war. Some countries that actively support, fund, and support war – such as America, Israel, and Britain – are more than willing to exploit innocent civilians to serve their own national interests. The US is an ardent supporter of Israel's right to exist, as their occupation by Israel makes that self-proclaimed "Jewish State" an illegitimate and illegitimate criminal enterprise, with the most heinous human rights abuses. On the other hand, most European nations who claim to support human rights and democracy are far less enthusiastic about Israel's occupation and oppression, despite the fact that many of those same European nations themselves continue to be complicit in Israel's criminal exploitation of Palestinians in a war that is supposed to benefit all sides. It's no secret that much of the funding for the war on ISIS comes from the US, with the UK, France, Germany, and the Netherlands not far behind. It's estimated that the US arms the "moderate" rebels in Syria by approximately $50 million in each month alone. When these same weapons are used by Israel to kill hundreds of innocent civilians (see here for an excerpt from one of my previous articles) it is abundantly clear that the US and its allies have no problem profiting off murder and carnage. If money is the root of evil, then who doesn't support the most evil nations in the world? The following are some of the most evil countries in the world and whose citizens continue to pay massive reparations to victims of their atrocities: #15 Russia For almost three decades Russia has been engaged in a long suffering war with Ukraine for control of the eastern borderlands, resulting in large parts of eastern Ukraine to become de facto "Russian" territories. The war has left millions of men, women, and children wounded and dead, including civilians who have been left homeless, while forcing hundreds of thousands of desperate refugees to seek new hope in other countries. In recent decades, the Russian economy has taken a hit from a collapsing ruble, which has been almost completely devalued against the dollar. Russia has also spent massive amounts of money supporting the regime of Bashar al-Assad, a man who has committed a long and brutal history of human rights abuses by using chemical weapons, as well as committing genocide against the Syrian people. #14 India India is a country which has been engaged in a deadly struggle for more than 100 years in the quest for independence, which has claimed the lives of over 5 million people, including an army of 20 million. However, one of the most notorious atrocities is the rape and sexual enslavement of millions of Indian women by British soldiers and colonial administrators. The rapes were motivated by an alleged policy that said "Indian women were fair game to be taken, killed, and raped as desired". The most gruesome fact of all? India's own army and police are still involved in these horrendous crimes today. What a disgrace. #13 Indonesia The country of Indonesia continues to be the second worst place on Earth in terms of human rights. The most extreme example of this is the continued imprisonment of over 200,000 Rohingya Muslims, ethnic Rohingya who have lived in the country for almost a century. This persecution is in part fueled by the violent ethnic cleansing of the state of Rakhine by the Burmese military, resulting in millions of refugees seeking new homes elsewhere. The mass rapes and crimes of torture continue to this very day, while Indonesia uses its diplomatic position to keep the global community in the dark about its complicity in these atrocities. #12 Syria The country that would probably be thought of as the worst country in the world by many Westerners is the Syrian nation. In less than 5 years, Syria has gone from being a peaceful country with a strong economy to an internationally recognized war torn tinderbox of an island. When the war began, it was fought with the backing of Russian military, diplomatic, financial, and financial elite. Today, this support is largely gone, and the same people that were once allied with Russia to prop up Syrian President Assad are now actively seeking him out in search of a blood bath to add to their long list of massacres. #11 Iran The Iranian people are the victims of a war that is no longer being fought for the benefit of one people. The Iranian nation is no longer the vibrant state that it once was, as its former ally Saudi Arabia has been allowed to exploit both its oil industry and its country's nuclear energy capabilities for economic gain. Iran's oil wealth is now largely used to sustain the Saudi monarchy's war machine and its own domestic repression. When the Arab Spring swept	0
We love it when we get to see our favorite celebrity models get down on our screens. But when that means sharing a nude body with the world, the results are always…unexpected. A new film from Director James L. Brooks shows just how out of control nude is when it hits screens. The film stars Naomi Watts, Jamie Lee Curtis, and Jamie Lynne Seinfield, and is a very adult dramedy based on the autobiography of Michael Crichton, who wrote the book, The Girl Who Was Plugged In. Brooks is known for his low-budget movies set in the 1980s, often starring the famous faces he's worked with before. The Girl Who Was Plugged in was shot on a shoestring budget, and has become the rare mainstream movie starring celebrities. Watts plays Amanda, trying to get away from her husband (Curtis) and her career in Hollywood to raise her daughter in L.A. We see Amanda go from her "normal" life as a stay-at-home mom to being a porn star on the set of a new sex film. In the end, Amanda finally meets her match with Pamela Lynn (Seinfield), who has a hard-on for Amanda. The rest of the cast consists of a plethora of familiar faces in supporting roles: Jamie Lee Curtis – Amanda's former modeling agent Mia Hansen-Love – Michael Crichton's wife Emilie De Ravin – the woman who plugs things into Amanda Nina Arden – a photographer who knows Amanda's secret Rory Fitzgerald – a producer trying to make a career out of their relationship Sally Lane – a high-end dominatrix Jamie Lynn Seinfield – Pamela Lynn's ex-girlfriend Jamie Lee Curtis is just as talented with her nudity as she is on screen. Watts' performance as Amanda really shows off her charisma. Curtis takes the role very seriously, and even gets in a few laughs as he and Watts both get embarrassed. The whole cast is great, too, and the chemistry between them is palpable. Even though The Girl Who Was Plugged In is a very adult film with nudity, it's not overtly sexual or violent. Instead, Brooks is trying to capture the tension between sex and privacy. And that's just what he does. The Girl Who Was Plugged In has gotten mixed reviews, but I feel like the more that you watch it, the more you see it for what it actually is. It's a fascinating and at times hilarious look at the ups and downs of sex and celebrity. Even Watts gives it her all, having to strip down to her lingerie and posing nude with Curtis. But, even though The Girl Who Was Plugged In is a movie with a lot of nudity, it also has a very low budget, and that makes for a very good way to show it off. It's so unique and different that I wanted to post it, and hopefully you'll enjoy it too. The Girl Who Was Plugged in opens on September 21st in U.S. theaters. We'll have more to share this week as the trailer begins rolling. Keep checking back!

The New York Jets just cut their opening day practice squad, and it was a quiet day for the team. So this morning I put together a look at some of the players who showed up, and one name that stood out was right guard Willie Colon. Colon was signed as a free agent by the Jets last week. Last year he spent most of last season on the New Orleans Saints roster, splitting time between guard and tackle. There hasn't been any indication that he is a future starter for the Jets, but he's certainly something, and was a fan of the organization when he visited for meetings the day after the Jets signed him. He's a tough guy to take a shot at, even though he's only in his fourth year in the league. In three years he's only had three injuries: a broken jaw, a concussion and a shoulder and elbow injury, the latter of which he suffered this season. In college, Willie was a first round pick of the Chicago Bears, selected in the 3rd round of the 2010 draft. That was a long time ago. If the Jets need him, they can always bring him up at any point. The key is that he's a backup at this point in the game. He's got some familiarity with Mike Maccagnan, as both were teammates of years past in New Orleans, and they'd both been cut this month. In addition, Willie and Maccagnan were two of the assistant head coaches during Maccagnan's time with the 49ers, and both have connections to the Ravens as well. Colon does not have an extensive background as a backup, but what we'll see is how he handles the Jets' opening game against Houston, who are the No. 7 ranked rushing team this season. [UPDATE]: Willie Colon has been released.	0
A new survey of young people has found a link between atheism and violence, and has also found more people are identifying as atheist. The American Religious Identification Survey (ARIS) polled over 18,000 people in the US in 2011, to determine the religious leanings of young Americans. The results of the survey show that a significant portion of the young people surveyed are not religiously affiliated, with a significant rise since 2007. "The results reflect an emerging pattern in America — that young people in fact are having less religious affiliation and affiliation with a religion is declining as the percentage of the population that is nonreligious increases," said Dr. James Gross, director of the Center for the Study of Public Religion at the University of Oklahoma. The ARIS found that there are more than 23,800 young people who do not identify with any religion, while just over 5,600 are affiliated with a religion but have lost their faith. The survey also found that there are 5,200 fewer young people who identify as Christian than in 2007. The survey found that over one-third of the people surveyed identify as atheist, agnostic, humanist or skeptic, and over 10 percent are agnostic or atheist. According the American Atheists, the percentage of these groups has increased more than 200 percent since 2007. In 2001, only 0.38 percent of Americans identified as atheist. By 2011, that number had increased to 0.88 percent, and is expected to be much higher in 2015. "The increase in nonreligious Americans is largely due to increased recruitment from non-Christian backgrounds rather than to a general rise in non-belief," said Richard Wike, a researcher in the Institute for Studies. The results of the survey showed that over one-third of the people surveyed identify as Christian, and less than 5 percent of Americans identify as atheist, agnostic or humanist. In 2001, the survey found that only 1 percent of Americans didn't identify with a religion. The survey also found that young women report a much larger percentage of Christians, with about 40 percent identifying as Christian rather than as atheist, agnostic or humanist. The survey indicates a similar trend, with the percentage of young men who are religious compared to young women is growing. The ARIS found that 15 percent of young men identify as Christian, while just over 14 percent of young women identify as Christian. Despite the increase in the number of young people with non-religious beliefs, religious affiliation is still the most preferred group among the non-religious. The ARIS found that over three-quarters of the people who don't consider themselves religiously affiliated are religiously affiliated. The least commonly preferred group was atheists/agnostics/secular humanists, and "nothing in particular."	0
A former student of one of the world's leading Islamic schools says he was forced to marry a young Yazidi woman in Syria after he was caught having an affair with a married Christian. Hamza, who had studied at Al-Huda College in Kuala Lumpur, said he was initially happy to marry the Christian woman following her religious upbringing, then his former girlfriend began to pressure him not to "marry a Muslim". "I was young, I was happy to marry a Christian. I was so happy I can't express it," Hamza, who wished to remain anonymous, told The New Straits Times from an unspecified location in Malaysia. "After about a month I was getting a lot of threats. She (the woman his former girlfriend) told some people that if I didn't marry her that maybe my mother would leave me. "She said she would kill the woman if I did not go with her. "She told other people that you have to save your virginity, so she would go around telling Muslim girls not to have premarital sex so they had a better chance to marry." Mr Hamza, now 26, said he became increasingly worried after his former girlfriend went to her parents about the threats and the threats came true. "She has gone to her parents because her parents are very strict Christian... they refused to accept my relationship. "I had not been drinking, or doing any things I should not have been doing, that is why she thought something might have happened between me and her... but I believe I was innocent," he said. "When I called my parents, they told me I must get divorced from her." Mr Hamza said his former girlfriend then began to threaten him for the sake of her religion and after two months of being physically abused by his girlfriend, he decided to move to Syria, where he hopes to become a doctor and an expert in the field of Islamic education. "I did not want to stay here (in Malaysia). I was not really happy in Kuala Lumpur... so I said to myself I have to get a life and work, get a place to live here where they don't harass you as much. I hope I can save myself for a better future after this." The New Straits Times is unable to contact Hamza for his own safety. Hamza's story is just one of the many from Malaysia's Malaysian Islamic students' association in conflict with Islamic authorities in the area about where they do Islamic education, or what they are allowed to do after they complete their studies. But Mr Hamza's story is just the latest of many reported on the group this year and one of its members said Malaysia's government was failing the Muslim students by accepting their claims of religious persecution. The religious students association, part of the country's second Islamic political party, has claimed that it has been victim of intimidation by Islamist Malaysia's governing religious party. The government, however has maintained that the religious students association is not welcome in the country. It has said it is not accepting their claims that their rights are being infringed. "The Malaysians have decided not to recognise our situation, this is their decision and it's not for us to dictate to them," MCA president Mokhtar Hamzah said. "The problem is we have a very powerful Muslim majority in the country... and they have their ideas about Islamic teaching. "To be honest, it's hard to find anyone that will speak out for us." The government is now considering an ordinance, which will require teachers in Islamic religious classes or programmes to provide their own copies of Islam's holy books at government expense each time they are copied, reports The New Straits Times. Hamza, who now lives in a house with 14 other girls, said they had to leave Malaysia after the school threatened him if he did not get married. In Malaysia's Shariah law, if a Muslim male and a Muslim female are in a relationship and both have not consummated it, then both are not allowed to marry. "If a relationship develops into a marriage, the Shariah law says that person are no longer legally the other's husband," MCA representative Khairiza Farah said. "That can be disastrous for a couple who wants to keep the relationship intact." The government has since made it easier for couples to have their relationships recognised under Shariah law, by not allowing a court to approve a Shariah marriage if the couple does not have parental consent or if there was fraud involved. It is not clear how many marriages are going to take place under Shariah law in Malaysia. In February last year, two members the Muslim students association were arrested after an argument in which the pair claimed they had been the victims of "unintentional racism". One member, Muhammad Fazila Abdul Az	0
This is a very cool looking piece of technology to say the least. If this is the sort of product you have in mind, you might want to take a closer look at the price. The current listing is currently at $500, or around the same price as a PlayStation VR set, a headset costing around £380. And the fact that it only runs Steam's new OS would be a big reason to prefer the Vive. That said, I wouldn't hold my breath on this project ever actually achieving commercial success. That said, if you really want this thing but you can't shell out a few grand on Steam right now, there are a number of unofficial and off-the-shelf options for you. Tagged with: games, tech	0
You could add even more of these to the list - which includes the following: "Paintings of the dead" "Museums in which corpses remain" "Museums for the dead" "Museums for the living" "Museums for the deaf and hearing impaired" "Museums for the blind" "Museums for the handicapped" "Museums for young men" "Museums for young women" "Museums for the elderly" "Museums for the very old" "Museums for the physically handicapped" "Museums for the blind" "Museums for the deaf and hearing impaired" "Museums for the physical handicapped" "Museums for the physically handicapped" "Museums for the mentally handicapped" "Museums for the mentally retarded" "Museums for the intellectually handicapped" "Museums for the physically handicapped" "Museums dedicated to the disabled" These were just a small sampling of the hundreds of categories that could apply to a museum. As I mentioned above, the U.S. Supreme Court has held that these categories do not necessarily constitute a de jure (permanent) place of worship and thus would not qualify for taxpayer-funded tax exemptions. While we wait for an official ruling, there's little cause to despair. You can still get tax breaks for museums and other types of privately funded religious organizations, provided they don't receive financial support from the federal government at the expense of churches, religious organizations, and their adherents. We'll get to that in just a moment. So, without further ado, here's the tax-exempt list of the most common museums in America. The Religious Foundation of the United States (RFUL), whose leaders include the likes of Jerry Falwell (pictured above) and Pat Robertson , is known for its ability to get religious groups — such as museums and universities — to apply for tax-preferred status and give them the kind of tax-preferred status that can cost them millions. As my colleague John McCormick wrote in 2004: The federal government does not distinguish between churches and religious organizations. In fact, it does not really distinguish between churches and any other religious institution, except the Mormon church, by granting them tax-exempt status. . . . Churches and religious institutions are given tax-preferred status because they need special help from the government to pay for the buildings, programs, and other activities of a religious institution, and only tax-preference status allows the charitable organization to spend more. In his own words (on page 11 in his book Christianity 101 and again in another passage). [T]he church's ability to obtain tax-preferred status is granted on the understanding that it will continue to operate in the same way as it has in the past. It means that we continue to operate under a single set of rules that apply to all religious organizations. The church believes it is in the public interest to be recognized for its religious and charitable work because it helps to strengthen the religious community, builds strong schools, and builds strong families. To make a charitable donation, the church must prove its commitment to a charitable work under the rules of an organization of its type, that "provides financial assistance to a religious or nonreligious organization so that it may continue to operate." So, as you can see, the Christian Science Church — which is a bona fide religious organization and operates under its own rules of its own kind — qualifies and does qualify for a tax-preference charitable status. And that, I think, makes a certain amount of sense, even if the church's stated intent is to "build stronger families", "strengthen schools", "build strong schools", etc. We've come across other examples elsewhere of tax-preferred status for certain religious groups: The Lutheran Church – Missouri Synod (LCMS) has a charitable status for its educational activities. The church's mission statement and tax-preferred status are listed on the church's website. The United Church of Christ in Cleveland operates in a similar fashion. It claims it is not, and never has been, a religious organization, despite the fact that both the UCC's purpose statement and its tax-preference status are listed on its website. Instead, the church operates under the rules of a church (and not a religious organization). And just last month, a UCC church in Houston was given tax-preferred status after the IRS determined it was operating as a for-profit congregation instead of as a religious organization. This was a victory for the church, because under tax-preferred status an individual congregation is only able	0

We are so pleased to have found a local publisher in England, with an expert editor in the United States. In England, we are very fortunate to have a strong and active literary life. There is no other part of the country that can boast such an abundance of bookshops and book magazines in the right sizes, at a number of different and excellent prices. Not only are there local literary magazines and bookshops, but national magazines, as well. We, like you, are very interested in literary publishing, both new and older material. At The Literary Review, we strive to produce publications of all national origins, in all the literary genres, from first-person essays to reviews, poetry, fiction, history. Some of our recent pieces include: "The Literary History of the English Poetry Movement," a book review of the first volume of The Eameses' New Poems , and "The English Poems of William Wordsworth in Their Own Words, 1900-1910," a new collection of his best-known poems. The Literary Review will continue to strive to support and encourage good writing as it pertains to the British Literature and Arts. Our goal is to publish work of British Literature and Arts throughout the world.	0
The man who was at the centre of a national debate over Islamism claimed the Islamic State had been trying to recruit him since the summer. The 27-year-old appeared on Newsnight with Jeremy Paxman to talk about his recent departure from Islamic State (Isis). He said: "They have been trying to recruit me for the last two or three months." Paxman then asked if he "wanted to die in a fire fight with the Islamic state" before explaining that the British Government had recently announced that he was being deported. When the presenter asked whether he was surprised, he said: "I don't know if I was, to be honest. I was expecting it. "I've been in this for four years now and even in Syria I saw Islamic State members who were very aggressive towards people. I was expecting them to be a bit more patient and a bit more patient and not try to force people." The revelation comes after footage emerged on Tuesday appearing to show an Isis fighter beheading James Foley, the second American journalist to be killed by the extremist group in recent months. The British member of staff said his life-changing journey began in July 2014. He was living in Syria at the time with a fellow Briton - fellow journalist Steven Sotloff who reportedly had been shot in the neck and face. Read more He told the documentary presenter: "We were together in Aleppo… We were both going to take our cars to go back to the UK. We both wanted to get out of there. "We went out in the morning for lunch. We ate. We drove in the night. We thought we left together for Manchester." He went on to explain that he was able to leave Syria because he wasn't in a military unit fighting against the Syrian government - a point of confusion for the Foreign Office and other British officials who previously said he had been on a "high-level IS unit". The footage, which appears to have come from a recent news channel documentary, showed his former colleague sitting in an interrogation room with his head wrapped in a black cloth. The camera was moved inside the room and then a man speaking with a voice accent raised in an Arabic dialect speaks through the cloth. He said "you are one of the British citizens that was recently killed, right?" but was still unable to give the name. James, who has an adopted Scottish father and a mother from the US, said he was "very, very sorry" for the death of Mr Sotloff and his family as his family had forgiven him. "I'm very, very, very sorry for killing the man Steven Sotloff and for his family and I'm very, very sorry to have taken Steven's life," he said.	0
"The first part was hard, but you have to go to the place, and that's what I've done since the age of 10." That's how former Manchester City midfielder Carlos Tevez describes his path to the club, where he became the club's top scorer after leaving his boyhood club, River Plate. "It was hard, but I didn't give up," he continued. "I worked hard and stayed until I was a professional. Now I feel like I'm here to stay, but maybe I'll go to another English club in the future. It could be Liverpool, Arsenal, Manchester United and others. "I'd like to be in this position for three or four years. I'm 34 now, and I feel like I'll be more useful for another six to eight years." The Argentine isn't the only Manchester City product whose ambitions could see him in a different country in the future. Tevez, who played for the club's youth teams, made his senior debut in the 2011-12 season following a successful loan spell. He did very well, scoring five goals in his first five league games, but he didn't break his current team-mate Sergio Agüero's team-leading strike record that remained in place at the time. Agüero has now gone on to win it twice this season, and Tevez has made clear he can't see himself replacing the Argentinian in the near future. "I hope to be a better player and a better striker, but not to be compared with Agüero," explained Tevez. "He plays every game, he's very important for the club; without him they're not in the position they are now. For me it's about doing my job and contributing to the team. The most difficult thing is to say that I want to come back to Manchester City in two or three years, if I'm still a professional. We'll see in a few years at this age. Maybe not until, but I have a contract with Manchester City until June 2017. I've said time and again that I want to have a long-term contract." This may come as little surprise to those who follow Tevez closely, and it's certainly a contrast to what he said shortly before moving to Manchester City. When he first left River Plate in 2011, he was an up-and-coming forward who had been in the stands for the club's youth teams along with Tevez. Just weeks after his loan move from River began, he told reporters at the end of that season that he wanted to stay at the club, but that he hoped to get first team opportunities. Just nine days after his comments, Tevez left City for Old Trafford, and since that day the club have been talking about how they're a big part of his decision. "It doesn't surprise me because when someone says they want to stay and that they want to stay longer, I'm not surprised," Tevez said at the time. "I have a contract with a club, and sometimes the club thinks twice about letting a player go. If you don't do your job, that can happen in any sport, but football is different, as the money is big. In England I played in the Champions League at City, was named in the team of the year in 2012, and then I went home."	0

They will get that one cup with their ingredients chosen at random. Once this cup is filled up, they are awarded a point or two and move on. They won't have too many ideas when filling their cup of joe. For the actual game there will be one board. All players will start off with a pile of cups. The table is a little large, I'll go with 60 players at 60 tables. The board will be 6×6, 5×5, 3×3, and 2×2. Each table will have a board with 2 tables on the same side, this will create 2 different cup of joe games. Players will start with 15 cups, and they'll move as far as they can. Each time they hit a wall, the cup is discarded, and that player adds a cup to their collection. Once they hit the end of the "Cup Road", this is "Cup Road". The player's score is based on total cup collection. The first player to get 100 points wins. First, lets make the ingredients. Each ingredient will have a name and a number. Flavors 1-5. All players create a cup of their flavor. These don't have to match the flavor number, you may make a unique cup of joe. The cup of joe will look in a random direction, it can be to the left or right, or in any direction. Cinnamon: 0-2 Cinnamon Kahlua: 1-3 Kahlua Vanilla: 4-5 Vanilla Mocha: 6-1 Mocha Peppermint: 2-4 Peppermint Vanilla bean: 3-5 Vanilla beans Mint: 6-6 Mint Lemon: 7-8 Lemon Sugar: 9-10 Sugar Cinnamon: Cinnamon is easy: Just find the number from 1 to 5, add them together and get the number in front of your name. For example, "1-2-4-5-6". For the "Kahlua" ingredients, find 5 in front of your name and add them all together. For example "4-5-6-8". For the "Vanilla" ingredients, it's much more involved. To find the number, the player must match the number before their name up with numbers from the next row up. This will count for 5. Once you put them in, match the number before it to "9-10". This will count for 10. Once that is done, match the numbers from the next rows up with the number below it. If matched, you get your number in the row below. For these examples, I used the numbers from the following row: "1-2-4-5-6" "4-5-6-8-9" This should match up exactly with the numbers that are on your ingredient ingredients. I also put "6-8-9-10-11" in there as well. The next thing we want to do is add them all up for the total score. This will give you the total score. Now you can score each player at anytime. If one player has enough points, they get to go first. The goal	0

The FBI says an 18-year-old high school student allegedly kidnapped at gunpoint and killed at least 11 people at a rural Wisconsin farmhouse, calling the crime "senseless." Interested in ? Add as an interest to stay up to date on the latest news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest Authorities have identified six of the 12 victims of the Oct. 1 shooting at the rural residence in Oconto County, north of Green Bay, on the other side of Lake Michigan. Police have arrested Cody Cousins, of Oconto, on charges of first degree murder and 11 counts of first degree intentional homicide at the family farm, according to the Green Bay Press Gazette. Police are still searching for the other victim who died in the attack. The 18-year-old, identified Sunday as Dylan Klebold, is from Newtown, Connecticut. The two are students at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colorado, where they killed 17 people last April. Authorities have said they believe the gunman had planned the attack for at least three weeks. It is expected to take weeks for the criminal investigation to determine a motive behind the killings that were likely deliberate, according to the FBI. The FBI said Sunday that Cousins, who turned 18 on Oct. 30, is now in custody. It did not release a possible motive for the killings, though authorities said he was upset over family matters. "Although we mourn the tragic loss of all our victims and have continued to investigate throughout this investigation, we know that the FBI's investigation into this tragic event continues," the bureau said in a statement. The FBI statement said it will make this statement in more detail at a news conference scheduled for 1 p.m. ET Monday in Washington, D.C. at which the agency will explain why it believes Cousins acted alone, and specifically whether he was motivated by a criminal or personal problem. A search party is searching for the gunman's remains on farm land across the street from the farmhouse. Cousins may have also been injured during the attack, the FBI said, but his wounds have not been "life threatening." The FBI said authorities were "working to determine whether this was an act of domestic terrorism" or a "gang-related event." Investigators are still trying to determine if there was any advance warning of the attack, or if it was a random act of violence, the FBI said. "This was a well planned act of violence, so we have to determine if this was planned to be a random act of violence -- did anyone anticipate this? The motive is still unclear," FBI Special Agent Bill Sweeney said Sunday. Investigators are seeking a motive and will be pursuing all available tips. Police said that, if the investigation finds Cousins was not in "direct control of the crime," it "will not necessarily indicate a role" of him in the crime. Authorities are unsure whether the suspect was inside the farmhouse and firing at the victims as they entered or whether he escaped from the scene. The FBI said it will not be releasing where the shooting occurred because of the situation's sensitive nature. Police have been searching the farmhouse with dogs and a helicopter but have not found the suspect. One of the victims had a concealed carry license. Another apparently was killed at the scene but his body was left there. The other victims, including an 11-year-old boy, were inside the home but escaped unharmed, authorities said. Police and SWAT teams rushed to the scene after being called to a domestic disturbance call at the farmhouse. They had responded to reports of an armed suspect on the property. Authorities have said they are not yet sure what led to the shooting. Police have said that the suspect had recently been receiving threatening text messages from a female friend. "I had friends at Columbine. They were killed in Newtown Connecticut," the friend reportedly texted Cousins.	0
I've got an important message for you. You can keep your iPhone and iPad. But your iPod will, without a doubt, be the most difficult to replace. The iPod Classic is more than 25 years old. That's old enough to have seen a lot of changes. It's old enough that it's long overdue for a major makeover. That's the reason why I don't see Apple being willing to sell its once-glorious iPod line to a third-party and will not discuss the particulars of the company's decision. But from a technological standpoint, what's changed is that even though there are no apps to go along with the new devices, there are hundreds of different ways people have already changed their iPhones into iPods. So we're going to start with some things people know people do when buying iPods, then we'll explore some of the things that don't happen very often, then we'll move on to some of the things we still don't know or appreciate about how people make them. PICK THE RIGHT APP FOR THE MOMENT. A lot of people like to know that their new iPod is the right fit before they buy it, and that's understandable. When you're considering a new phone, there are certain things you have to know about it in terms of physical specifications and performance before you get to the fun stuff. And when you go to a department store and buy something new, you're faced with dozens of options that cover dozens of different price levels and features. But if you are the kind of person who wants to know and have all the details before making a purchase, just go to Apple.com and enter your information and order. Then tell them you know what you're doing so that they can offer some guidance. They'll help you figure out which models are suited for specific conditions. But just know that the majority of the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus models are fine for most people on most days. This is important. If you go to the Apple store and get someone else's advice, you might pay more than you should and get a worse experience in the store. Also, the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus come with wireless charging, but some other phones in the premium iPhone line — most notably the iPhone X and iPhone X Plus — do not. But to be fair, we don't even consider these premium features when we're reviewing phones for you or when evaluating what we think looks and feels great. And it's also worth mentioning that you should not buy a phone using Apple Care+ just because it's an iPhone. The premium products do cost more, so the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus can pay for themselves much faster in the long run if you don't purchase Apple Care+. I want to reiterate the importance of taking your time. If you pick up a high-end smartphone that runs out of battery before you're finished, you're going to end up paying a steep bill and you'll probably wonder why Apple doesn't charge a little more for an insurance plan based on how long the phone can run out of battery. I have personally purchased more than one model of the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus — one for me and one for my sister. In two days, I replaced the older model back from a service center where it had been for two years. That was $30. Not too long ago, we bought a iPhone 7 Plus off an Apple website in China at a very good price on an international payment. That was an extra $40. But you need to pick the phones that work best for you. And if you're going to make a serious investment in a new phone, you don't want to buy an iPhone based on Apple marketing or rumors. You want to get a phone that fits your lifestyle, that meets the needs you've decided for yourself, and you want to be making a long-term decision. BE A META-MANIPULATOR. This is a problem that's not limited to iPhones. We love to make predictions, and we think we know what people will do when they put a new phone into their pocket. But it never works out like we think. For example, I love to say that people will start carrying around a second iPad more often. And I'm very confident that there is going to be something that will come along — something you use to multitask better than the computer that we just bought. But it never does. We also think people will buy two phone numbers with the iPhone 8/Plus. But in a recent research study we ran on cell phones among 1,000 Americans, we found out that about 80 percent of that group would still buy only one number. We think that every time you get a phone number, you'll start using it a little differently — taking a minute to think about what you are going to do when you pick up your phone and what you're going to use it for. And that will	0
The most important thing you probably don't know about your body is that it is made up of more than 60,000 cells and tissues that each perform crucial body functions. They all play a role in keeping our health by absorbing nutrients and maintaining a normal pH balance to prevent illness. Many of them play a role in regulating how the body develops: how hair forms in the scalp, how bones and tissues develop and where new organs and blood vessels will form. Most of these cells and tissues develop in the embryo. But some may be formed when cells in a developing part of the body — known as an embryo — undergo changes in their DNA. When these cells and tissues go on to become other organisms — like a fertilized egg — they have the genetic potential to become other parts of that organism. It is often said that the human body contains billions of cells. And if you are lucky, you might even get to meet a cell in the body for a week. But that will never happen in the human body where more than a trillion cells are in every cell, and those are the cells of every living thing. If all the cells in your body existed in a solid ball, called the cells of a single body part, then the mass would reach 30.5 billion tons. But the cells that make up the body do not all have this same location: skin, muscles, blood vessels, and other organs and tissues have different locations. The human body contains 50 trillion cells, each making up about 50,000 body cells. The cells in the eye have only half the surface area of the eyelids. The cells of a single organ, like the brain, can overlap. If one organ were to replace another, the resulting organ would contain cells from half the cells of whichever organ it replaced. This is a diagram illustrating how the body is made up of different cells:	0
A new survey found half of Americans say they don't consider the military to "serve the American people." (Bryan R. Smith/AFP/Getty Images) About half of Americans believe the military is out of touch with American values, with another 40 percent saying they "don't think the military cares too much about Americans' freedoms." Just over one-third — 35 percent — think the military's values are in tune with American ideals. The Pew Research Center conducted a survey last week to examine how Americans view the role of the military, and their opinion of the military itself, and also how they view other institutions in society. One striking finding is how far public opinion has shifted from where it was in the 1950s and 1960s. "You can point to a particular generation — the Baby Boomers, for example — as taking a more critical or negative view of the military," said William E. Hartung, an expert on the Middle East at the Center for International Policy. "There is not a consensus about how important the military is to American society, except among elites," said Eric A. Posner, a professor at the University of Chicago Law School and author of "Why Americans Hate the Military." But the military is "the only institution in society that has been able to expand in terms of scope and budget during the past 50 years" while "other institutions have decreased in significance," he said. [The military's role in domestic politics is more influential than Americans realize] The findings suggest that Americans have come to view the military differently, and differently from where they started, said Hartung. "It's not just a small group that have this idea of the military as distant, a relic of the past," but also the general public. The military has seen its popularity soar, especially with young Americans. According to a study by The Center for Public Integrity, two-thirds of Americans in the 18 to 29 age group are "very interested" in joining the armed forces. Only 27 percent of Americans 55 and older said they have a "very personal" interest in military service. But there is still a long way to go: Fully 54 percent of those who want to service in the military don't consider their potential service in the military to serve "the American people." And only 38 percent of Americans think the military has the people skills needed to serve America's needs if it goes to war. [How a woman turned a military recruitment ad into a powerful protest] The Pew survey showed that Americans view the military in two ways, according to Philip Klinkner, a professor of political science at Virginia Commonwealth University and author of "American Politics in the Military and War in the Military." It is portrayed as a "militaristic institution" — an idea that might be rooted in some kind of moral judgment about the institution, but that "does not really go beyond that," Klinkner said. Or, Americans see the military as an institution that is at odds with liberal values and democratic values. For example: "Almost half of Democrats, 53 percent, say the military doesn't serve democracy well, compared with 41 percent of Republicans," the survey said. Americans were somewhat more likely to consider the military a military institution for "socialist, authoritarian or dictatorial governments" than it was for democratic republics, according to the survey. But majorities also considered the military to serve democratic republican and socialist principles. The majority of those polled felt the military was more interested in the needs of America's "elite" than about the needs of the average American: 54 percent of respondents said, for example, that they believed the military was focused on protecting elite privileges compared with only 32 percent who felt the military was "more focused on the needs of the average American," the report said. The survey also showed a significant number of respondents view military service not simply as part of their civic duty but as a "passionate pursuit." "The vast majority of Americans who serve in the military think about it in terms of their personal values and what they want to do with their lives," Posner said. [The secret life of Navy SEALs] It wasn't all negative responses in the military poll. An independent group with the same name, the Citizens in Charge Foundation, conducted a similar poll about two weeks ago, in a similar format, and came to similar results — that about one-in-four Americans had a "very favorable" view of the military, and that almost half thought its role was to serve the public. The survey, conducted by ORC International, asked how Americans view the military based on seven questions. The first was "Do you think the U.S. military is out of touch with the values of the American people?" The second was "Do you think military policy reflects a commitment to protecting American democracy or protecting American privilege?" The third was "Do you think the U	0
A group that wanted to know more about the new iPhone's security features — and whether they would allow users to remotely wipe the iPhone — has succeeded. Sixty-two members signed onto a Facebook group on Monday, with the simple goal of trying out a new hack that allowed them to completely erase the iPhone 5. "The iPhone 5 can be turned off by a simple wipe and reboot," one member wrote in the group. "So after a month we went on a mission that we have not been able to stop." Another added: "After three days of hard work we did it! We have broken the security on the new iPhone 5!" But just a few minutes after the post was published, people pointed out that the iPhone 5 could be made to stay turned off by a malicious attacker with a similar hack. So Apple issued a statement — first published on Tuesday on the company's website — and later on Tuesday it also put out a software update. The new software update turns iPhone 5 users' screens into iridescent white, just in case there is somebody in your home who wants to take a look at your iPhone and wipe off all the data it has. Apple also added a new message for users who want to wipe their iPhone and reboot it with the screen up. "This new feature protects your iPhone," the company's statement began. "This technology requires the iPhone 5 to be connected to power in order to function. If you have recently upgraded to iPhone 6 or later and are concerned about the security of your device, you can update to iOS 8.3 via iTunes on your device." The company says the new feature is limited to just iPhones 5 and 6 models — but if you have an iPhone 3GS or 2G, then it may have worked for you already. And that's an important point: It's not as if these two hackers are the first to make this sort of iPhone 5 destruction trick. Earlier this year, security researcher David Wagner posted a video demonstrating an attempt that turned iPhones into spy cams after attaching them to various gadgets including smart TVs and Google Glasses. And Apple has been trying to make its smartphones a bit more secure, making it easier for app developers to put in extra layers of security. That includes the new iPhone-to-iPhone pairing feature, which allows Apple devices to automatically pair with one another using a unique code the user has to enter.	0
The following correction was printed in the Guardian's Corrections and clarifications column, Tuesday May 4 2007 In a series of articles which began in the first edition of this week's print edition, we described the Israeli government's intention to hold public hearings on how its government should respond to Israel's treatment of Gaza. But since the beginning of the operation in Gaza, a decision to hold such hearings had not been made. On Tuesday June 17, the Israeli cabinet approved a request for an investigation of how its government had acted as a "neutral party" in the Gaza conflict. This included a public hearing. The cabinet said it accepted the UN's demand to hold a hearing that would be held on the Israeli air strikes on the Palestinian city of Rafah. The Israeli prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, said he wanted to hold the hearing as soon as possible to determine whether the civilian deaths during the air strikes were justified. But, on Monday, the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, said the Israeli government was not interested in the details of how its air force behaved as part of the ground operation. He said: "No Israeli prime minister, and certainly no Israeli cabinet, has had any interest in the rules of engagement for the military operations, because they know how to behave themselves." The next day, the Israeli government said it had ordered a public investigation, but no details have been unveiled. Benny Hill E-mail the writer at ehillbenny@guardian.co.uk	0
As we noted before, this week's issue of Famitsu has an interview with Namco Bandai's Hajime Tabata. The interview covers pretty much all things related to Final Fantasy XV. It looks like there is some great news about Final Fantasy XV that will be coming out soon. Here's some of what Tabata-san had to share: The original idea had been for a "new Final Fantasy on new hardware" for this year. I'm happy to know that this isn't the case. There will be a new battle system as well as a new story. Tabata-san-san also talked about the original character designs that have been leaked. He said the following in regard to the designs, Of course I was very surprised when I saw designs for Noctis and the party. Tabata-san-san had a special kind of satisfaction with the party's costumes, which you may remember as "a bit too much for me", (that has) come to feel like they're becoming part of the players' hearts. There is something more. "The development staff" from the project are all going to do a "live action show featuring our development team as a whole." I really can't wait for this. I really can't wait for this. I also want to bring out a concept for Noctis/Tidus that is even deeper, darker, more mature than his character design. I'd also like to try doing a music video for "Lulu's Theme". The interview also mentions that the project is being completed over a shorter time, as a whole. The overall time that the project has been in development is about 4-5 years. The reason for the shortened development time is because "the team is on a different rhythm for a very long time." Tabata-san-san-san also talked about how there is another team that is working on games for the Nintendo Switch. You can grab a copy of the magazine here: http://www.famitsu.com/en/gdc/ As for what we can expect from the game for the Nintendo Switch, it seems as if it will be a continuation of the console's launch. We will have lots of details about that soon.	0
In a small ceremony in a small town near the northern border of the state of Maharashtra, an ancient sword has been blessed and consecrated by a man known as 'Karnarangi' and a small ceremony is being held to mark it as 'muhurta' by one of the biggest temples in the region, the Jain Bhadrapal Temple. "This sword is very special. The sword was bestowed to the great temple by the king's brother and the sword was in his name which is unique in the region," said Valsi, a resident from Maharashtra's Chinchwad district who is in charge of maintaining the weapons. Over 150 swords from other regions were scattered in Maharashtra's Chinchwad district, and these were arranged in a procession which passed through Chinchwad and Rann of Kutch. The procession was started by Rakesh, a Jain who had a large temple in Chinchwad who is one of the biggest Jains in the country. The Jains in Maharashtra, a state which has a vast population, are mostly concentrated within the Pune region. Some of them also live in Bhavnagar where they worship at the Jain temple. "This is the first time since the Pune region began having Jain temples that we will have a 'Muhurta' sword," said Valsi. "After studying it with experts from the United Nations in Geneva we decided to make the sword in the village of Bhagatpura because we need the temple's blessings. So it was blessed here last night," Valsi stated. Valsi said that there is no other sword like this in history and it is the first of its kind in South India. In fact, the temple had gifted a replica sword to the king of Nepal in 1987, after his coronation, which was presented with a small ceremony to Jain leaders visiting Nepal. "These swords are the pride of the people of Chinchwad who have maintained these weapons for many generations. These swords are considered as a symbol of peace between the peoples and their respective villages," Valsi noted. Some experts said that 'muhurta' was considered as a sign and seal of good luck for the swords and that Jain scriptures describe it as an act of worship and blessing. "It symbolizes both blessings and peace. Some say that it symbolizes peace in the soul and is proof of the purity of the soul after death. Some believe that it represents the victory of good over evil, and that it denotes the victory of good over evil in a war," said P.K. Mishra, a prominent historian from Pune. Experts said that this sword is believed to be from the 9th century, but they said some historical records claim that it dates back to the 8th century. "It may be the only 'muhurta' sword in its entire history. There may be many other weapons of this type but it is unique. It is unique in South India because of where it comes from and because it is a symbol of harmony," Mishra said.	0
If you thought that it was hard to convince voters that the Republican health care bill was anything other than a massive tax cut for the wealthy and massive tax cuts for the health insurance and pharmaceutical industries, then get your head out of the sand. On Tuesday, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office reported that the Senate's Better Care Reconciliation Act would result in the loss of health insurance coverage for 24 million people, even after fully repealing the Affordable Care Act. For those of you who have forgotten what the Affordable Care Act is, here's a reminder: Obamacare allowed the insurance industry to charge more for people who had health problems and to provide coverage that was no better than what you'd get with a pre-existing condition. The Affordable Care Act has been a huge success. It is a great idea and a good idea for the United States and a good idea for the rest of the world. Republicans seem, for their own reasons, to have decided to stop working on these ideas. Senate Republicans and President Trump have not done a very good job of explaining how their plan is a good idea or explaining how it will achieve its supposed goal of making the Affordable Care Act better and cheaper. The Senate bill does not fix the problems with the Affordable Care Act, such as giving insurance to everyone and holding insurance companies accountable. It keeps some of the most damaging aspects of Obamacare, like restricting insurance for the disabled, giving tax breaks to health companies that leave the sickest patients to die in the streets, allowing the insurance industry to charge more to older Americans for the same plans available to young Americans and allowing insurers to change the coverage they offer to people so they can increase profits by keeping premiums and deductibles high. And the Senate bill does not deliver on promises to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, with promises of better health care and cheaper premiums. To be fair, the CBO did not expect the Senate bill to get passed. It expected most states to decide not to comply with those insurance market reforms created by the Affordable Care Act. But to say that 24 million people will lose health coverage when you have an actual plan to replace it is ridiculous on many levels. For starters, if the Republican plan were to actually replace Obamacare, not just try to get rid of some parts of it, that would still leave about 24 million people with no insurance at all. But it is also false when it says that Obamacare will be repealed and replaced under the Senate bill so that "people with preexisting conditions can finally be covered." The Senate bill allows states to impose a condition on the coverage that someone needs. People who live in a state where there is no such condition, such as Florida, Kentucky and West Virginia, can get insurance if you give them your word that you won't end up in the emergency room because you fell ill and in turn need a lot of medical care. But states such as California, New York, California and Oregon cannot require such a commitment to the insurance companies. That means that people cannot get coverage under the Senate bill if they will end up getting serious illnesses or serious injuries. This plan is like insurance that you sign up through the back door, where you are not guaranteed that it will cover you because if you get sick you don't receive the benefits you believe they are going to provide. People may not have health insurance now but they will when they cannot get insurance through the back door, something that happens with people with chronic disease and those who live near the poverty line. People living under Medicaid or Medicare have insurance no matter what. People with private medical bills can get coverage through insurance companies or pay their medical bills and in most cases will pay for their medical bills instead of the government. And the Senate bill ends tax credits that give the very poor higher subsidies based on their health situation. The Congressional Budget Office has found that if people with low incomes lost tax credits because of repeal of the health care law, more than 14 million people would no longer be able to afford insurance. If any of this sounds like it's bad enough, there is also the fact that Obamacare does not provide health insurance to all. A recent study found that 19 million Americans still don't have access to health insurance. The Senate bill could provide coverage to some of these people. So that's another advantage. But the Senate bill could give insurance to only 7 million people. The Congressional Budget Office predicts that 3 million fewer people could be covered over the next decade if the Senate bill goes ahead. And some of those people who will lose health insurance might not have any insurance at all. This bill could make it possible for states to stop Medicaid expansion and cut people's health coverage. Many states have seen an influx of people coming off Medicaid who were formerly eligible for it but who were not covered by the expansion. So, yes, there could be some coverage for some people. But that will probably only be for those who	0

First year tuition & fees: $60,000 + books = $160,000 + $2,500 = $240,500 (assuming you can get into a top law school but won't have to take out loans on top of your law school loan for at least 5 years, and assuming you are doing this after you graduate) Second year tuition & fees: $72,000 + books = $144,000 + $3,000 = $214,100 (assuming you can get into a top law school but won't have to take out loans on top of your law school loan for at least 5 years, and assuming you are doing this after you graduate) Third year tuition & fees: $98,000 + books = $178,000 + $5,000 = $234,500 (+ 2.7x your average annual salary above) (assuming you can get into a top law school but won't have to take out loans on top of your law school loan for at least 5 years, and assuming you are doing this after you graduate) Fourth year tuition & fees: $132,000 + books = $240,000 + $8,000 = $334,500 (+ 6.3x your average annual salary above) (assuming you can get into a top law school but won't have to take out loans on top of your law school loan for at least 5 years, and assuming you are doing this after you graduate) Financing the gap Even after paying for tuition and fees above, your student loan burden still may be a problem. If you are applying into the law as an out-of-state lawyer who wants to practice in North Carolina, your student loan debt will probably dwarf your starting salary. For students who borrow from public lenders (like FHA/annie), the debt may also make it difficult to purchase rental properties—because, in many states, they might not be able to access mortgage finance for a certain period of time. Fortunately, many programs help mitigate the burden—through income-based repayment plans, deferment programs, and other financial tools. These programs can help you stay on track if you aren't able to work for several years. Some other ways you can help You can consider a scholarship There are many scholarship programs out there that can help you cover the cost of law school. One program we recommend to students is the American Bar Foundation's (ABF) Scholars Service. You can use your award money to pay for school instead of taking out loans, and if you take advantage of other types of scholarships and grants, the difference can be considerable. For a list of ABF Scholarship opportunities for 2019, click here. There are also a variety of non-borrowable scholarships, grants, and internships you can check out, along with the Legal Aid Society and the Legal Services Corporation of the United States. For information about what you can do to repay your student loan debt, click here. You can borrow from your parents It might not be the most efficient way to pay for school, but according to National Conference of State Legislatures, at least 30 states offer some form of tuition assistance to students who aren't working. For example, many states provide free tuition at public postsecondary institutions (for a few students), and some states have loan repayment programs specifically for undergraduates.

More ways to pay for law school You can start paying law school with an offer of employment Once you've been accepted to any law school, the second step is often the most critical to finishing. Because you are paying almost the entire cost of your education in fees, salaries, and the books you need, you need to find another way to make extra money during law school.	0
The federal government says it's giving another $15 million over two years to Alberta's oilsands. "With new investment into our provinces' industries, we have the flexibility to invest in skills, technology and capacity that create good jobs, and help secure our energy future," Finance Minister Bill Morneau said in a statement Thursday. The money comes at a time that Alberta is seeking another $1.6 billion from Ottawa to offset losses in the oilsands sector under its recent carbon tax. Story continues below advertisement "These additional investments will allow us to better understand our oilsands and provide critical support to its workers," he added. "We are also focusing in developing new technologies to improve Alberta's productivity while expanding and improving our production capacity." The budget for the oilsands includes $2.5-billion in capital investment over two years. It also funds an initial $12-billion grant to the province for the industry over a nine-year period. Alberta's NDP government is seeking $10.5-billion over nine years to deal with the downturn. A report released Friday by the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives says the tax revenue has not made a material difference to the overall economy.	0
TUSCALOOSA, Alabama -- Two University of Alabama students accused of robbing a West End bar Friday have been charged with armed robbery and aggravated assault during the incident, according to a police press release. The university is now investigating whether the incidents of the two men taking a female bystander and stealing $80 in an ATM machine were connected, according to the release. Tuscaloosa police said that after they went to the West End bar, 2032 University Ave. E early Saturday morning to conduct surveillance on the location, they saw a female and a male enter and exit through the door. Police said the male suspect then grabbed the female victim from behind, pushed her to the ground and started the ATM machine. The victim, who was not a University of Alabama student, called police via a cell phone and said that she and another bystander had been mugged inside the bar. Police said the video showed the female victim trying to fight off the male suspect who then ran to a waiting car. The male suspect then got into a car and took off, police said. While chasing the men, another female victim took out a weapon and shot at the car, police said. At this time there do not appear to be any additional victims, police added. Two students were taken into custody and are being questioned for their involvement with an armed robbery at the restaurant Friday. The first suspect was identified as 20-year-old Brandon Mitchell. He was charged with armed robbery with a dangerous weapon, aggravated assault without inflicting serious bodily injury and robbery during a robbery. He is being held at the Tuscaloosa County Jail on $15,000 bond. The second suspect, 20-year-old Tyler White, is charged with aggravated assault with a dangerous weapon and possession of marijuana. He is being held at the Tuscaloosa County Jail on no bond. The West End bar is on University Boulevard in Tuscaloosa. Check back with AL.com for more details.	0
The U.S. will continue to have its embassies in Cuba but the U.S. will no longer supply them with food and other supplies because of security concerns. The State Department said Friday it has "no plans at this time" for a full lifting of the trade embargo, which was imposed by President Jimmy Carter in February 1980. White House Press Secretary Jay Carney emphasized the importance of getting Cuba back to the negotiating table on human rights, and said Cuba must begin releasing the U.S. political prisoners. ADVERTISEMENT "This administration is clear about our priorities," Carney said, pointing to "our support for restoring the relationship with Cuba and the restoration of normal diplomatic relations with the government of Cuba." Secretary of State John Kerry John Forbes KerryRubio wants DOJ to find out if Kerry broke law by meeting with Iranians Time for sunshine on Trump-Russia investigation Pompeo doubles down on criticism of Kerry: The Iran deal failed, 'let it go' MORE also made a statement on the embargo, saying his country looks forward to working with Cuba's government toward a full, full and secure thaw in relationship. "We recognize that the United States must always remain true to its commitments under the 1961 Cuban-American Mutual Recognition Act and our commitments under other agreements with Cuba; to refrain from economic or commercial transactions with Cuba contrary to our interests and to promote respect for the rule of law and fundamental freedoms, including the right to free religious expression," he said. "We also recognize that Cuba is a country with a rich and vibrant democracy with which we have had a comprehensive and strong relationship in recent years. There is no reason why the United States will be in a position to provide assistance or trade in the future to Cuba if that would be contrary to our interests or a breach of our obligations under other agreements with the government of Cuba and other countries." In April, President Obama sent to Congress an executive order that said he could take steps to ease Cuba's economic embargo, including opening embassies and allowing U.S. companies and private individuals to do business in Cuba. Cuba announced last week that it was preparing to send to the National Security Council a draft agreement with the United States to help begin opening embassies to U.S. firms in Cuba. But the embargo remained, as did an oil embargo and an arms embargo. But Carney indicated Friday, for the first time, that the U.S. could begin to lift the travel ban for American citizens in the Cuban Embassy in Havana. A Congressional aide told NBC News that the staff who worked on the Iran nuclear deal are now working to prepare the document that would require the U.S. to end its arms embargo against Cuba, which would require a vote in Congress. The aide acknowledged that there is no guarantee that the embargo will be lifted by November. "We always look forward to further engagement on the issues that matter to the majority of Americans, our interests in our relationship with the Cuban government and our priorities around human rights, especially the right to live freely, without fear," Carney said. The official noted that the State Department continues to support "reforms that help promote the peaceful transition of the government of Cuba." Carney said the U.S. would work with Congress and Cuba's Government of Cuba to determine the best path forward. The aide noted that this morning's announcement by the State Department of the ban against the U.S. government's "trade, investment, or other normal commercial activities" in Cuba will require congressional action to lift it. The aide also said the State Department would be ready to begin lifting the trade embargo on Cuban cigars once new legislation is passed by Congress. The aide emphasized that the State Department has made very limited exceptions to the oil embargo, which is aimed at halting the nation's ability to export energy products — particularly to its people. As a result of the oil embargo, the U.S. can no longer send products to Cuba to buy energy, or use the U.S. dollar to buy them. The embargo now affects the purchase of Cuban-made commodities from any other country. "That applies to both the importation of raw materials or finished goods to or from a commercial enterprise by persons of the United States or by a United States-registered entity," the State Department said. Also Friday, the State Department announced a new visa waiver program — including a special one-year visa, the only kind of tourist visa available to U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents — which it said would open up opportunities for Cuban citizens to visit the United States.	0
 If you're like millions of Americans, you're paying close attention to the 2014 midterms: your senators and representatives will decide whether the Constitution should be amended so that the Supreme Court might overturn the Supreme Court of the United States. You may take comfort in that fact that the last time the country did this, it took an event to achieve it. In the 1960s, America's Senate voted down a proposed amendment to the Constitution that would have allowed the president to fill Supreme Court vacancies with justices appointed by and with the advice and consent of the majority of the Senate — because the Senate had not appointed enough. For one moment, America was ruled by Supreme Court justices with little public respect and whose decisions were almost invariably affirmed by the Court as a whole. That was not the end of the story. After the Senate failed to re-nominate John Paul Stevens to the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in 1980, the Senate took a break: the chamber nominated him, and the president named him. By the time the Senate voted in 1982, the Senate had taken a second break: it nominated Thomas Swayne to his old seat, just to be clear, and he was confirmed. And that is how it went for five years. And this time America is taking care not to make the same mistake. The Senate Judiciary Committee has already started holding hearings on the next president's nominees — two or three for each vacancy. "I think that would be good if the Senate had the opportunity to hold hearings because of the way the system is set up that we would not have any of these vacancies for the rest of the Obama administration," says Daniel Mach, former solicitor general and deputy solicitor general under President Clinton and a leading scholar of the Supreme Court. The problem is that under the Constitution, a president nominates a Supreme Court justice, and the Senate chooses the full 12 justices to fill that seat during its "advise and consent" role. Once the nomination has been forwarded to the full Senate, it is up to the Senate: a) "advise and consent" on the nominee; b) vote to confirm or reject that nominee without delay; or c) "advise" and "consent" but then fail to act on the nomination for a full year, allowing time for consideration by the Senate Judiciary Committee. The last three options are very rare: only nine out of 644 Supreme Court nominees since 1835 were confirmed in that manner. The Senate cannot, however, choose between "advise and consent" and "advise and notify" — its only option is "advise" and "notify" — and thus the current Senate majority has chosen the latter. The president would like to appoint Scalia's successor on "fast-track" authority so that the vacancy will not remain open for longer than 18 months, which is the current federal deadline to fill Supreme Court vacancies. President Obama wants the Senate to hold hearings for the next nominee to fill a vacancy on either the Supreme Court today - Elena Kagan or Sonia Sotomayor, who are likely the two most likely candidates — or his chosen nominee from the lower courts — Justice Samuel Alito. At this point, of course, there are not that many other nominees who would fit in the range of possibilities for who could be the next Scalia, or any other potential nominee. So the Senate's task is more or less to make the next Supreme Court appointment by August 2, the date of the next inauguration — a date whose timing was negotiated in advance of President Obama's first inauguration. So the best they can do now is to make sure that the next president gets the Supreme Court nomination he or she wants while not wasting anyone's time. There could be a more radical option if Senate Democrats decide to obstruct the nomination of a right-wing conservative as their "number one" choice to take the seat. That's a move we haven't seen yet, although several senators have told the Washington Post that that kind of "showdown" would be unlikely to succeed in a court-majority Senate. But that is an option on the table. If Obama nominates a Justice who turns down the appointment and is confirmed by a vote of less than 60, they could vote to change the constitutional rules of the Senate, which would be an unprecedented move but one not outside the realm of possibility. But that would be difficult to pull off, if for no other reason than there are a lot of justices who have been appointed to fill the last three vacancies on the Supreme Court, as of now. So there has been a lot of chatter lately over whether a President Mitt Romney is going to nominate just a right-wing Republican to the seat. If he does, I think there's a decent chance that a Supreme Court justice will change his mind on his own accord — but who will the president nominate? And while the answer may not be a Scalia-style conservative, it would be a lot more palatable to liberals and progressives, to	0

You want to make it clear that you're a proud member of the "real" American middle class? Then you're one of two possible responses to this question: you're either a clueless snob or you're a snobby middle-class stooge. I'll settle for the third option: You have a pretty big mouth, which makes you a smug hypocrite. In the wake of last week's presidential election, people have been debating about what exactly defines the middle class. The American Economic Association's Working America project recently published a survey showing that many Americans still think the middle class has shrinking importance. The survey found that 48 percent of us think the middle class has been shrinking since 1975, and 32 percent think the middle class has been shrinking since 1980. But there's a bit of a chicken-and-egg problem. Is there really a "middle class" in America – or is it a myth? (See the chart on page 15 of Thomas Frank's What's The Matter With Kansas? for what that question really is.) Let's start with this: a lot of Americans think they live in the middle class. According to a January 2012 Gallup poll, 41 percent of Americans think they are middle class; another 18 percent think they are lower class. The middle class is a myth, people. What we have are the low-income, the low-skilled, the poor and the homeless. Now, one might quibble about the question on that survey, which asked, "Do you think the US middle class has changed or gotten smaller between 1975 and 2010?" If you put "change" in quotes, you're really just talking about "has the US middle class grown since 1975?" But if you put "less" in quotes, you're really just talking about "decreased." To put it another way, the middle class doesn't have grown. They have changed. Some of the reasons why the middle class has changed include globalization, the rise of the "gig economy" (for the jobless who don't have a steady wage), "free trade" (which has meant millions of job losses in manufacturing but millions of new jobs in developing countries like China and India), and the increase in inequality we've seen over the last four decades. The middle class has changed, and it has grown. That is important in our current debate about American social policy. The other question that I was going to answer at least partially by telling the "real America" snobs to watch some Fox News Channel would have been about this: How has that middle class grown? It's impossible to determine the extent to which the US middle class has grown because the US government has no official data on it. In the past, we could look at what people earned by looking up their median household income. For most of this millennium, median income has steadily declined, and no one thinks the US middle class is growing. But if you're going to do any kind of official analysis on this, you should also look at the number of people living in each household. If the overall size of the US middle class remains constant, then the numbers of non-working households would also probably follow, leaving us with a middle class of working households. And then of course, we'll all have to account for the rising portion of elderly Americans who do not have dependents, so let's add those to the equation to come up with the number of US households "in the middle" – and then we can have a better discussion. But this is where you end up with "middle class" as someone's best argument for why the working class should not oppose policies designed to help the middle class. This isn't to say that there aren't plenty of policies that work to strengthen the economy and lift the working class higher. They do. For example, the US tax code is basically a simple progressive income tax. This has helped to make the US an "offshore haven" for capital, which has resulted in a massive capital gains tax in the form income taxation that is higher for those who make more. There's no denying that the working class is getting hurt by this. In theory, the high tax rate paid by those rich Americans in the top brackets is hurting most of those at the bottom of the income distribution, since their average tax rate is above the corporate tax rate. In practice, though, the top 1 percent does much better than the average working person since there are lots of ways that rich Americans can shelter so many profits at lower tax rates. According to the Council on Foreign Relations, some 75 percent of the top 1 percent pay no taxes on more than 30 percent of their income. Another reason that I don't buy the middle class myth is that there is virtually no evidence that the middle-class has shrunk in the US. A recent analysis from the Economic Policy Institute on the income distribution in the US shows that if anything, the	0

A new set of images from Star Wars Episode VIII – The Last Jedi was released today and they continue on from what is a rather solid teaser. While some have felt the previous teaser looked slightly too busy with the Star Wars theme and a lot of the shots are of vehicles, this new set of images take that off the table and focus on locations. And not a lot of them. We've got some exterior shots of the planet Ahch-To, some of its residents, which include some new TIE Fighters and some new Imperial Troops. We've even got some interior shots of the city and it looks very nice. However, it wouldn't be a bad idea to take out that "C" on the main city sign too? We've seen a lot of new images coming out. We have a great looking shot of Maz Kanata, a new stormtrooper and an Imperial Trooper that is completely different from the ones we've seen before – the ones shown during the prequels. And then, we got another new Star Destroyer! It looks a lot like a black one, but we've got to take more looks at this one before we call it a black one. Speaking of ships, we've got a new look at the Star Destroyers, and this one takes the cake for me – I love this one because it's so different from the others. We've even got one of the first shots of Snoke and Kylo Ren together. And, Kylo Ren is the Sith Lord who has been missing in action in the past few movies. Here's a look at some of the new Sith characters. Another set of images from the new Star Wars sets has come out, this time with the new villain Maz Kanata (Emilia Clarke)! With all the news on the new Star Wars films coming out, and with some still-to-be-screenshots we're getting, it's been quite a busy time! While there are still quite a few more hours of Star Wars: The Last Jedi to go, today we are finally at the point where we can see where Episode VIII is taking place… and it's actually more reminiscent of Return of the Jedi than the prequels were… I'm a fan of that, so… not much to say about a day when we didn't want to go to bed. As a parting gift, here is the final teaser for Star Wars Episode VIII – The Last Jedi:	0
I'm not sure a single person of any background was surprised when Donald Trump was elected President of the United States and that he has, even more recently, begun to push his agenda with the help of a Republican Congress. I'm not sure people were surprised that, in the process, he continued the culture war on women through efforts to repeal or defund Planned Parenthood as well as defunding other important groups that help support women's health such as Title X and ACA, all of which have led to more unplanned pregnancies and unintended pregnancies. As a result, more women of varying degrees of ability are being turned away from health care services altogether. Some people are concerned that Trump's election has caused some women not to pursue reproductive healthcare and perhaps even to change their reproductive healthcare providers because they feel that the abortion debate has already been settled. However, this is not true. Despite his previous rhetoric, even Trump's pick of Judge Gorsuch to fill the late Antonin Scalia's Supreme Court seat has nothing to do with whether women can exercise their reproductive rights any more than Trump's nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch to replace Scalia helped end the abortion debate. This is especially true for women who already have legal abortion and do not need to take the extra step of getting a prescription for the medication that goes with it. To the extent that President Trump has been able to achieve any significant legislative victories, his victories have done little in the way of restricting access to abortion. Although the Trump administration has taken some steps to curb the availability of telemedicine abortion, the availability of medication abortion drugs varies, and telemedicine often relies on third parties. Furthermore, while there are many new legal restrictions on abortion providers, there are also significant restrictions on abortion care as well, which include state restrictions on Medicaid reimbursements for abortions and prohibitions as well as federal funding restrictions. In other words, even if the Trump administration has been successful in getting at least some of its priorities through to at least some of its goals in 2017, that will not affect access to affordable and legal abortion. What about changes that people might be concerned about, particularly for women who have abortions? Some of these women may choose to undergo the abortion procedure in the United States with the assistance of their state insurance coverage, so women who are not able to travel will still have the opportunity to obtain this. There is also a potential for some anti-choice forces to take over states as well as the federal government, possibly by seeking to undermine the Affordable Care Act and Medicaid expansion. It is unclear whether anti-choice forces would continue trying to defund or otherwise end health services for women that rely on Planned Parenthood, but it is certainly possible. This, however, would not end the abortion debate once the Affordable Care Act goes into effect and the Medicaid expansion is fully implemented across the United States. This would, however, affect access to abortion care in general in the future. For example, in some states that are still running Medicaid expansion, the state will have a hard time paying for abortions for women under the new expansion because the expanded Medicaid population is so large and there is so much money available for it. Furthermore, some states, including Massachusetts, might want to limit funds available for Medicaid-expanded women to prevent some of those women from seeking publicly funded abortions. A conservative Congress might try to reverse this situation with some form of federal block grant. There are many other areas that the Trump Administration will have to focus on, so it will be years before we know what the end of the abortion debate will mean. Nevertheless, it doesn't matter to women who already have abortions or who have considered having an abortion how hard it might be to get access to abortion. They still have the right to have one and the right to access and use the care they need in their particular medical conditions. Abortion opponents have already proven themselves incapable of making even small changes to what happens to women when they seek out and pay for an abortion. Women's access to reproductive health care is not an issue to be settled now or within the next four years. Abortion may be an issue in the long run, but it is not an issue to be taken up by people who claim to be supporting the rights of women to control their own bodies.	0
I'm on a new job, and I'm hoping not to make a lot of mistakes in my first week working. I'm in the process of installing a new router. My home network is just about at end-to-end, and I'm installing a switch from scratch. That, of course, means I'm going to have to learn all I can about routing and IP addresses. I'm going to need some tools, like a Wireshark script and a router simulator. I thought to use the Wireshark Script. But I have tried that tool for quite a while and have never been satisfied with it. The Wireshark script is good for browsing the network to see how the network is set up so you can use the GUI to configure some of the routing. But I've always found the Wireshark scripts, even the GUI version, lacking the ability to do a lot of configuration. After having worked for years as a system administrator, I've been conditioned by my experiences to be able to edit the configuration of my network in the GUI. I finally decided to write my own script. It's a very simple script, and the instructions that follow will cover it. It doesn't have a huge amount of features, but at least I'm getting more familiar with that particular tool. It should be relatively easy to adapt to use with any similar protocol, and the instructions can be used for other network simulations as well. The commands you'll need to know to make the script work are: netsh interface show all netsh interface version netsh status The script will start by showing you the name of the router, and it will list all of the devices it's communicating with (which could be a single computer as well). If you look at the name of the host on the router, you'll see something like "MyIP". You can determine the IP address of a connected computer by calling netsh interface ip show hostname. Next, go back to the start of the script: #!/bin/sh  ### START OF SCRIPT while true; do if [ -f "/etc/hosts" ] then echo [ -n $1 ] echo ${1##*/} else echo $1 > /var/tmp/hosts echo ${1##*/} fi sleep 1 done echo "Done!" ### END OF SCRIPT rm -f "/etc/hosts" The script then starts by checking to see if you've setup a default gateway or gateway hostname (you wouldn't want to have them both defined, at least not that early). If you haven't setup any, it'll display the gateway name you would have entered into the command line. What the script will do, then, is look the name of the default gateway. It will determine if it is IPv6, and compare it to the name it came up with. If they are the same, the script will display a new line for the gateway. If the two are different, the script will set the gateway to a different hostname (the name of the default gateway). So, what's going to happen is, if two machines are both IPv6, but use different default gateway names, the IP will be routed to one network address, which is the old gateway, and the other into the new one. To keep it consistent, we'll also want the gateway name to be the same. #!/bin/sh ### BEGIN OF SCRIPT netmask=21 gateway=192.168.0.10 # END OF SCRIPT The next thing the script does is check to see if any device is connected (which means an ethernet connection or port is available). If a device is connected, this line of the script will set it to active in the device, so it can be used if needed. If two computers are connected, the script will try to determine the name of the device they are connected to. If that matches the localhost name, the script will set it to active. If you just need to be able to change a device into active (like with the wireless card), you could set it to active with the # command. It's worth noting that this script is not meant to be run on any host. You will have to get the IP address of the device you are trying to set to active, or the gateway name, either in a command prompt, or by using the /proc filesystem. #!/bin/sh ### BEGIN OF SCRIPT int ip; ip=${#ip}; echo ${ip##*/} ether [ -1 +0 ] ; if test -d /etc/ethers &	0
The new Apple TV streaming media box might be limited in one way — it's not supported by the iTunes Store, and it can't access any of the paid version of music or video rentals. Both problems with the new Apple TV have popped up over and over, with multiple manufacturers, iOS developers, and even Apple itself pointing to a variety of reasons for why streaming Apple TV services doesn't work. The best that can be said is that you might see some slow down or random disconnection, which may be the result of having iTunes Match enabled or because it has no direct Internet connection. A new report says that the reason Apple TV and iTunes are missing out on music and video rentals might be that iTunes has been hacked. As reported by MacRumors, Apple has found several hackers using a tool called "Maver" to access the iTunes Store remotely. According to the report, Apple could take further action, but at this point, it seems its best course of action is to just let the hackers have the iTunes Store access.	0
What's the first thing you do when you land on the beach? You take a look at your sandals. Now compare that to what one woman told me when I asked her which was her favorite sandal. And her answer wasn't a surprise. "They're all the same," she said with a laugh. I don't know about you, but I have a tough time disagreeing with someone who knows me as well as her. In the end, after trying to talk her out of her opinion, I did some research and found that a lot of women are wrong. As I found out, there are different types of sandals, and some can definitely be considered the "wrong" ones. 1. Shoe sandals These sandals are what some call a "one-size fits all" sandal. As a result, they work just like traditional sandals. 2. Slipper sandals These look and function better with flats, or a thick sock. They're comfortable and they don't require excessive laces. Not all slippers are the same. A narrow toe is a sign of a good slipper. I think this one is mine. 3. Ballet stilettos I wear these because I like the shape they give me. It's not exactly the right shoe, but it certainly is functional. 4. Shoe boots These may be a good choice if you're wearing a suit; but I think they work so well with shorts and skirts because they look so stylish, they look smart as well. 5. Ankle sandals In my case these look too big and heavy and I've tried to size down a size or two. However, for me their shape can sometimes make it look like I have a bigger foot, so I have to take the extra time to check out the fit and the quality of the shoe. I also don't like the way they keep slipping. 5. Sneaker sandals In general, I feel like these are not the smartest choice; they do look nice and fun, but that's about it. 6. Barefoot sandals No surprise here, these would look terrible and impractical to most people. I think my preference lies with slipper sandals. 7. Crocs These may be comfortable, but they can't match the feeling of a perfect sandal. They just feel too tight and restrictive. My only recommendation is to avoid these unless you are very sure to be in "the flow." 8. Bandanas For me, Bandanas can be a nice touch to one or several sandals, but they're not a necessity. So, while many women (myself included) wear sandals for the fun of it, in the end, the right choice is something that only really matters to you.	0
R.E.M. made a major announcement last weekend. The band's new album, "Autobahn," was going to be out September 9. But the band wanted to delay its release while the record label worked out the best way to release it. We heard it for free on Spotify a month ago. Here's how the album sounds: We'd rather play "Autobahn" for you straight, so here it is in its entirety on YouTube. "Autobahn" features a lot of heavy metal, but it has a soft, fuzzy sound and a mellow melody. And it includes a song inspired by a poem by Jean Genet: "L'oeil et la gaule." The whole album is available on Spotify.	0

The UESPWiki – Your source for The Elder Scrolls since 1995 Quick Walkthrough [ edit ] Detailed Walkthrough [ edit ] The Waypoint [ edit ] As soon as you enter the Dark Brotherhood Sanctuary, you will see five Brotherhood members standing near a fire: Vex, Brina Merilis, Serana, Alain Dufont and Serana. If you go up the path to the right (eastward), you'll see Rolff Stone-Fist, the master of the training area, talking to him. Note that he only allows you to train yourself if you're at least level 10. You will then be approached by Brina with a choice: You can attack her ("The Battle of Balmora" quest line). Or you can attack Serana ("The Battle of Balmora (Part I)" quest line). You can choose either choice and proceed to continue. The Training [ edit ] Once you're done with your dialogue with Brina, head inside the training rooms. The first task is to walk through the two rooms and get through the obstacle course to the second room. You can use the wall tables and the wall doors as obstacles to avoid. Make sure you have at least 40 Speech in order to make your way quickly in this arena, as there are many distractions. You will get a set of training robes at the end. For the most part the opponents in these rooms are easier than those in the courtyard, and should not be a significant issue. The challenge is still being a Master Thief and not dying a lot, though. The second, and easier, task is an escape from the arena with Serana. She will talk to you and offer to be your "guardian" (that is, she will follow along with you). As she says so, make sure you have her in your party ("The Battle of Balmora (Part I)" quest line). You will automatically move her from the courtyard to a room on the western side of the Sanctuary, near the entrance to the training area. The best location is between the two pillars outside, which are in front of you when you cross the courtyard gate. The other two can be on the upper level with the statues. Simply find the one nearest the entrance and go to her. She will sit with Serana and the two of you will exit the arena. She will walk off and the rest should follow. As she talks about what happened, make sure Serana has joined the Brotherhood. With the training complete, leave the Sanctuary. It'll be night so head back to the Daedric Shrine. The Shrine [ edit ] To return to Moraelyn, head back to the entrance to the shrine and the entrance into the Dark Brotherhood Sanctuary, which is also located here. There's a gate down and three other guards in front. Defeat them and you'll fight the boss, Moraelyn. He is level 30 (hard to kill due to his high armor class). He has the ability to summon an ebony golem. As a tactic, a group of warriors is an efficient way to take him down, but they can't heal their allies nor do much else while on the ground (except for the one you can heal the most with the Ring of Hircine). Mages can usually kill him just using spells and the ring. An alchemist is another possibility, since their bombs and Fire Salts will take out some of the golems on their own and might also work against Moraelyn himself. The key factor is that each golem has a threshold of health that depends on its level and is easily bypassed even with a low level mage. If you try to fight Moraelyn, make sure you put as much distance between you as possible. If you can manage that, the two mages with the most fire damage can do a good bit of damage to the golems while keeping enough distance to remain safe. As a tactic of staying still and healing if needed, you can also try using the Stendarr's Aura spell once each. You don't need to use the spell for the full duration because he still heals himself when you hit the threshold, so just the full circle. Also when using the spell, you should make sure not to use any spells on the golems themselves, as you can cause their health to go out of bounds. However, this doesn't apply to when you are healing Moraelyn as they are completely immune to magic attacks, so you can heal yourself in between using the spell. Moraelyn will drop a Daedra Heart at this point or if you had killed Vicious Dog (who you can't loot). Either way is fine. Sister's Rest [ edit ] After the fight you will see the three dead Brotherhood Initiates on the floor. One of them is actually Serana. You see two Elder Signs coming out of the dead warriors. The first	0
"We've just had our first public meeting," said the mayor, John Linder. "As I said on the air the other day, we are not going to rush this development. It is going to be subject to a lot of analysis and scrutiny." Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address.

The councilman said he intended to work with both development companies and homeowners to bring about a "sophisticated community," one that would preserve affordable housing in a neighborhood with high rents. On Monday, a representative for the developer said that there would be no building permits or permits issued for any residential construction at the site by the end of this year, and that the company was hopeful that the project would start in spring or summer of 2009. The site has the potential to be a vibrant community, the representative said, adding that it "sounds awesome." The councilman also pointed out that the project would not include the shopping and dining center currently planned, though he hoped to bring those businesses to the site. According to a map on the developer's website, the project would include about 500,000 square feet of retail space, a park at the west end of the project, a "gondola" connecting it to a "new river" that may someday be developed, two hotels, a parking structure — and a new development adjacent to a park. The plan calls for the river to be developed as a mixed-use development that would include restaurants, stores, parking facilities and a riverwalk. The developers are asking for $45 for every square foot that they wish to develop for a total of about 30 acres, though Mr. Kressman's representatives declined to confirm that figure to The New York Times. The development has been approved for a federal tax break, which would grant nearly two-thirds of the tax breaks that are available to projects of that size for 15 years. The other third of the tax breaks would have to be acquired through property tax payments. Photo The tax break will likely create a backlash from city taxpayers, and some city officials say they are not willing to give the tax subsidy unless it includes strict limits on parking. While developers will be allowed to build about 2,500 parking spaces in the new development, a city planner has warned that there will be "significant challenges" attracting the necessary number of off-street parking spaces to the project to make it economically viable. Last Wednesday, the Times reported on some of the neighborhood's critics, including some residents of homes in the area who questioned the viability of the project. At the news conference, Mayor Linder said he believed that most of the opposition to the project would die down in time, and then most of the new neighbors would appreciate the benefits. "People get over it," he said, and the project would become a "major economic development" in the community, bringing businesses, housing and other amenities. "We will give the neighborhood a chance. I don't think we need the negative publicity out there. We don't need to try to scare people away," he said. In an e-mail, a spokeswoman for the city housing department, Jill Krieger, said that the city "is aware of the project's plans and is actively working on the city's part." Ms. Krieger added, "We welcome the neighborhood to have the opportunity to participate." Advertisement Continue reading the main story Asked about the tax breaks, Mr. Kressman's representative, Kevin Walsh, said they were a "great" use of tax money and a "first of its kind" for a project of this size and type. He said it would be a "difficult development" to move forward without the tax breaks though, and the company had agreed to work with the city to make sure that was the case. "We are trying to get a developer to take a more progressive approach," Mr. Walsh said, adding, "We're not trying to give them any slack at this stage." As with other major projects in the city, the neighborhood will be forced to weigh in on the site when its zoning, the size of the development and the amount of parking required comes before the Planning Commission's committee on neighborhood concerns on May 18. Mr. Karmen of the Planning Commission said that if his committee recommended the	0

Filed in: The Verge The company that makes the Raspberry Pi has just announced it will sell to consumers with the Pi 3.  As the Guardian wrote, "It marks the first time the Raspberry Pi has been released to consumers. At the time of its launch in 2012, the product, which plugs into a television, computer or mobile phone, was a prototype."  Since then, the Raspberry Pi's fanbase has grown considerably, and the first versions of the machine, released in 2012, were a hit in classrooms and universities around the world.  By this year, there were more than 20,000 Raspberry Pi units sold, so it looks like the company made a wise decision to release them to consumers.  It will be interesting to see if this leads to similar success for the Pi 3.  (Via The Guardian, image is from the Raspberry Pi web site) Powered by Cincopa Video Hosting for Business solution.	0

Tamerlane, 33, shows the terror group as "idiots" who "just want to cause chaos". In a new clip of himself, he says: "We've got the best military strength as the world has ever seen in the world, and we don't even have enough to clean out London." Tamerlane goes on to say the terrorists' actions were proof that extremists are "losing the battle" with their enemies. "I believe ISIS want to prove they are losing, they just want to cause chaos. (Image: Sky News) (Image: Sky News) "They want to make a statement," he says. "But we are the only ones who can bring down this wall of fear in the land which God has given us. "That wall is a very narrow place, only about the size of the city of London. And the only way we can destroy it is with a force, with a movement, with our families, with our kids, with our men, with our women on our land, the land of our ancestors. "It's not like the way it is in many other parts of the world." Tamerlane goes on to tell how he and former London Bridge bomber Khuram Shazad Butt drove to the scene of the attack on Saturday night despite having been tipped off that there was another attack in the works. He describes Butt as "a very nice guy", while saying Butt had acted like a professional on the night and that he was a "very nice guy". He praises the way Butt, 30, was able to "go to the event" after he was "scared" of the incident and even went to check on his brother Nasser and their mother. (Image: Sky News) He says: "I want to remind him that his own security is a lot safer than his brother's. "This is our brothers' people, not our dogs, we are a lot better people than the ones who attacked the crowd, and you know that we are going to bring this organization to its knees in the only way possible. "We are the only ones that can put a stop to this. "It's not just Toulouse - all of France is under my control. It's not for want of work. "We have every weapon. We are Muslims and we are ready to go to war, so long as it is an Islamic holy war." (Image: Sky News) Speaking to Sky News, Tamerlane says the attacks in Paris have "put the security services on the spot with terrorism" and said he's "worried" about France but is very proud of how his men in Paris defeated ISIS . He insisted they will continue their attacks on the terrorists, calling them "idiots" who "don't have a plan, don't have a strategy". "What I want for the future of France is stability again," he said. "I want our society to be secure. And by that I mean, like you did after 7/7 of course, we have to be extra vigilant and more alert. "But also we've got to be alert to the radicalisation that is out there. Because you can see there are a lot of people. There are a lot of people from all walks of life, you know, who are becoming radicalised." Tamerlane added that he didn't believe any intelligence reports that an attack on London was imminent, insisting he's been able to predict them and stop them, saying a "lot" of warnings did not turn out to be true. He said: "A lot of times these warnings come out as a lot of smoke but there is a lot of fire because they don't want to warn us. "We have these idiots doing these things, they have no strategy and they don't have a strategy - you know, they think ISIS is going to take over the world in six months. "Why can't they see this for what it is? "They are stupid, these idiots and I don't like dealing with these idiots, because you can't even take a good joke like this, it's really something." When asked how he could remain so calm, Tamerlane replied: "I am very strong. I am not in panic mode. I still see things coming. (Image: Sky News) "Some people can run - I am very strong."

By Jeff Conant | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com When the New Jersey Devils' 2014 team first emerged on the ice in the summer of 2012, it seemed like some things were changing on and off the ice for the franchise. New coaches. New GMs. Two rookies head coaches who would be the fourth in franchise history, replacing the first two — Kevin Rooney and Lou Lamoriello, respectively. For many NHL players, such a turn of events would be an eye-opening experience. For the Devils, it was their biggest offseason of the past decade, and perhaps the most pivotal move they made in the process -- in addition to many others. The Devils came onto the ice in 2012 with a group of 18 players in their first training camp, which was the third in eight years with a new coach -- Pete DeBoer. The Devils had three games in 2013-14 after trading Cory Schneider to San Jose, but still had players from 2011-12 in attendance. That was a big, big chunk of change for a team that finished 12th in the East during the 2010-11 season. "The biggest thing last year is how I felt as a hockey player, because I really didn't know, for a long time, what to expect," said goalie Cory Schneider. "I was trying to make a transition to this league, just trying to make the team, making the team a better team, and I didn't really know what to expect. "At that time last year, I didn't know what to expect. It was, if they were good or bad, I wasn't worried," Schneider said. "Now having that experience and knowing how I felt in that situation, I have confidence in them that they can do this. There are no excuses now." After the 2013 season ended by losing in the first round of the Stanley Cup Playoffs, DeBoer was fired after the Devils had made a disastrous playoff exit, with a roster that was largely left without veteran players from that season. The team was stocked with 22-year-olds and under-25 players, which was not ideal. The team did not have a first-round pick to replenish their prospect pool, which resulted in a rebuilding process. "When you're rebuilding, guys are growing and getting more and more experience. It's a good time to be a young player. We're starting to get some experience from guys playing in the World Championships here, too," said goaltender Cory Schneider. At the center of the rebuild was Travis Zajac, the former second-round pick who was traded to the New York Rangers for Adam Larsson in March 2014 and returned to the Devils this season as a top forward prospect, playing with veteran players Michael Ryder and John Moore. The 2014 team had three forwards under contract to go to camp in 2013, and none of them made it over to try out for the NHL team. That, it turned out, had been Zajac's plan all along; while he was still in the AHL, he started reading about the team and began plotting how he could play his way to a call-up to the NHL during training camp. "You go into a season thinking about the season next year and about things like that," Zajac said. "You read all the time, you know everything goes into this game in one way or another so I wanted to make sure I was ready as soon as I got a chance. That's what it came down to." The Devils ended the 2013-14 season on a high note after winning their only Stanley Cup in franchise history and finishing 12th in the East. But a change at the GM position with general manager Lou Lamoriello and coach Peter DeBoer had a significant impact on the team. The Devils were eliminated in Game 7 of the Eastern Conference finals by the Philadelphia Flyers, and DeBoer and Lamoriello were then fired in the offseason. "We don't want to get to where one person's decision has a big impact on the team; it's more about what decisions are the right decisions," DeBoer told Jeff Blair of the New Jersey Star-Ledger after he was fired. "It doesn't matter who they hire as GM. We were a top-six team last year. I don't know if the team with these new personnel can be as good as it was. We're going to have a chance." The change at the top meant the Devils were left with three rookies in their first training camp (Zajac, Martin Brodeur and Andy Greene) and in the fold with limited depth. The team quickly fell, and didn't return for a full-blown rebuild until last season. "I think at the end of last year last year, we went into this off-season trying to rebuild," said Schneider. "You've got two young forwards coming here.	0
The state has said its decision to ban sales of e-cigarettes to youths was just a matter of public health. The state Health Department said the decision to ban sales to people under the age of 21 came after a study indicated that, in the past, teenage e-cigarette use may have caused young people to take up smoking tobacco. "We made this decision in the interest of public health," said department spokesman Stephen Dietrich in a telephone interview from Salem. "It is important to understand that we did not do this because of any anti-smoking bias or because there was concern about e-cigarette use on college campuses." The decision to ban sales of e-cigarettes to young people was approved by state health officials at the last minute before Christmas. A meeting was called at 1:30 p.m. Dec. 19 as state officials scrambled to prepare rules to ban the sale of e-cigarettes to anyone younger than 18, although the law says anyone 18 and older can purchase the devices. As a result, the e-cigarette industry went into overdrive, trying to make up for a month of missed sales. Consumers flocked to online shops, where prices fell, and sellers in the past few days have posted their sales figures and prices. In the two months since the state decision, the number of sales of e-cigarettes in Oregon has fallen from 6,800 to 3,800. The most recent figures available by the Oregon Health Authority show sales to people 18 and older fell from 25,742 units in September to 19,964 units in October and 16,928 in November. The figures represent a 14.4 percent drop from the same period last year and a 3.6 percent drop from the year before. State and industry officials in the last few days have been working behind the scenes trying to find a way to keep the new regulations in line with a previous state law that banned e-cigarette sales to people under the age of 21. The law was passed in October 2012 following the deaths of two teens in October 2011. The first was 11-year-old Matthew McPherson, who was accidentally killed when the battery in an e-cigarette he was using caught alight while he was watching pornography. In a separate incident, Christopher Gonsalves, a sophomore at Eugene High School, died of carbon monoxide poisoning after a battery in an e-cigarette caught fire during use in his car. The law's sponsor, Sen. Betsy Johnson, R-Redmond, said e-cigarettes have become a gateway tool for young people. "It is like if we had not banned alcohol," Johnson said. "The problem is they will continue to move toward more dangerous stuff and the state needs to step in." In a meeting Wednesday, state officials met with representatives of the two e-cigarette companies that supply Oregon with products. Some of the state's top health officials were in attendance to discuss the proposed regulations on Wednesday and to talk with companies, as was state Rep. Earl Blumenauer, D-Oregon City. In that meeting, and with several staffers present, Johnson said, a senior health official suggested using a percentage of e-cigarettes available for purchase to discourage usage among youth. The senior staffer suggested 25 percent or even 25 percent less products would result in a drop in the number of underage vaping products and an increase in sales. Johnson said it would not be unusual to have sales less than in a single month of a sales year like November, and that it seemed the senior state health official was implying that a certain percentage decline in sales was needed to help youth understand their choices. "It's possible," Johnson said. "It is possible. In some ways it doesn't take much if it is not happening the way the administration thought." Blumenauer said the state has a better chance of keeping rates of cigarette use through the teen years in check if it tries to encourage e-cigarette use and that the state should instead focus on public health issues. He also contended that the state should try to discourage consumption of e-cigarettes, arguing they are a "gateway" to smoking tobacco. "No adult at all should buy these products," he said. "It is not the business of the state to encourage smoking. It is the business of the state to take away the tobacco product." The state Health Department does not plan to change it e-cigarette rules, Dietrich said. "We will enforce the law as it is," he said.	0
"I can never forget my first time taking a photo with my camera in my hand." ― Anonymous, on the first pictures he took with his camera [src] John William "Jack" Phillips was an old, white American soldier stationed at Fort Hagen, New Jersey during World War II. His father, also named John William "Jack" Phillips, was a prominent, wealthy businessman, and was a prominent citizen of Hagen. When his father was killed in action during the Battle of the Bulge, he took his first photograph during the Battle of the Bulge and later was stationed at Fort Hagen as an officer at the post. During the war, Phillips often took pictures for the public service announcements in the Post Office, in which he displayed his photography skills; his photographs often showed him in the midst of battle, standing alongside his commanding officer. In 1951, a Japanese spy named Hiroo Onoda stole all the photographs from the Hagen Post Office. With the help of a fellow pilot named John "Jack" Farragut, Phillips and Farragut flew into the North Sea and recovered the photographs from the submarine in which Onoda had taken them. Farragut gave Phillips the photographs to be held up as evidence against Onoda. The photographs were seen in the courtroom during a court-martial. In 1952, Onoda confessed to murdering his father, John Farragut. However, he refused to admit to the charges of treason against Phillips and Farragut. Onoda was subsequently sentenced to life in prison and was released from prison in 1954, four years prior to the film's events. Contents show] Biography Early life and death One day on April 26, 1942, Phillips' father, John William "Jack" Phillips was killed aboard a B-17 Flying Fortress when a mortar shell exploded near the plane's engine. The death of his father caused Phillips an overwhelming sense of grief after his mother, his aunt and his great-aunt were all killed by Nazi Germany during World War II. In May 1943, Phillips' father was killed by another mortar shell explosion while helping the Army Air Force repair their B-17 Flying Fortress when all of them had returned from training. The death of his father became a traumatic event that Phillips never wanted to forget. During his post-war military training in New Jersey, Phillips met a young woman named Alice Cathery who was a photographer at Fort Hagen during this time and asked her if Phillips could have a few photos taken for a poster the Army was printing that was supposed to be the story of his life. The photo of him in the post office building was his first and, at the time, is the only photograph Phillips ever took. In 1956, he took his first photograph, taking a picture on April 26,1946 that shows him sitting on top of his bed in his house on the beach near his home in Hoboken, New Jersey. He would take many more photos, often from behind and standing alongside his superiors in the Army. The photo, however, did not become a successful advertisement for his job and he did not find the image particularly appealing. He took many more photographs of his home, of himself and his family and took his first picture of his father, John William "Jack" Phillips, which he would later show in court during an infamous court-martial in 1951 in which Phillips was accused of having committed treason against the United States of America; he refused to deny the charge of treason and was sentenced to life imprisonment from that night till he was eventually released from prison in 1954. World War II and the film After the war, Phillips continued his career by being a photographer at Fort Hagen during the war's early months. He started at Fort Hagen on June 28, 1941, and served there as an infantryman until June 1946. He died of pneumonia at Fort Hagen on November 2, 1947.[2] During the final moments of the film, the photograph of Jack Phillips was used as evidence against his enemy, Hiroo Onoda, during an American court-martial. Jack Phillips did not get to see his father, and it was not his first time with the death of his father. Phillips became increasingly emotional after learning why he was going to court and that he was going along with his lie against the Japanese.[3] His son, John William "Jack" Farragut, had taken his father's photograph in the post office to be shown to the court so that they could believe his side of the story for his sentence. Personality and traits "In this place where we've grown up, we just don't know what to think of death. We don't want to see a face that hurts. We just want peace.

The University of Maryland, one of the nation's most elite universities, is offering scholarships for women to obtain a master of science degree or a master of fine arts degree after graduation. The four-year scholarships -- designed for those who are currently taking graduate work in "traditional fine arts disciplines" -- were "designed to give our outstanding female students the opportunity to pursue career opportunities in our highly competitive field," said Deborah E. J. Johnson, dean of the University of Maryland's College of Arts and Sciences, in an email. The scholarships, available starting in 2018-19, will award $15,000 each for undergraduate and graduate students in fine arts fields from across the world. "We have long made a commitment to giving students -- students of color, students in low-income communities, students with disabilities -- an equal opportunity to study at one of our schools," Johnson said. "Our scholarship plan reflects that belief, focusing on the undergraduate and graduate degrees where the most talented women pursue the opportunity to further their education." Johnson said the scholarship system is an expansion of existing financial aid that can be used to support undergraduate and graduate students in such areas as fine arts, music, and the performing arts. To be eligible for the four-year scholarships, students must be accepted into a full-time degree program at the University of Maryland, or currently in another program that will count as one of the four-year programs. There are no prerequisites for the scholarship plans to be applied. The College of Fine Arts and the College of Design at Maryland will not be eligible for the four-year scholarships, according to the emails sent to female students last month and first reported by the Annapolis Citizen. "If you are currently in another school that counts as both a degree program and a traditional fine arts field you will not be eligible for these scholarships," Johnson said. The online application was launched Wednesday. A special website with links to scholarship opportunities was created and a "sign-up" period will be offered in the next few weeks. Applicants who qualify for scholarships will then be contacted by each college, Johnson said. Students will need to apply separately for each institution, she said. Applications for both the graduate and undergraduate degree programs can be downloaded from the University of Maryland's website. Johnson's email noted that the university would also be offering awards for graduate students who seek scholarships for master's and doctoral degrees through the Maryland Higher Educational Enhancement Program, which is available to students with financial need. Other benefits include a reduced tuition rate for graduate students in those two fields, the ability to earn a master of fine arts degree in two years, and the option to double course and double tuition, Johnson added, according to the email. The scholarship money is available for all students who are admitted into a full-time undergraduate program with a major in fine arts and fine arts education or from another discipline that is an area of study in which there is a shortage of students pursuing a degree. The four-year awards are for the second year of a student's undergraduate degree and for the first year of a student's graduate degree, if she enters the graduate program without other scholarships offered in that area. The scholarship amounts -- for undergraduate and graduate students -- are:	0

As always, you can download Django 1.10 from the Django download page and get Django 1.9 as well. Notable new features The biggest change to Django in Django 1.10 is the introduction of Template Toolkit. Using Template Toolkit you can build your own templating engine in minutes by importing the django.template.tempotest module. It is based on django.template.toolkit.FrameworkChoice and extends the basic concepts to a generic templating engine for your Django projects. As a bonus it also lets you define your template with HTML5/Javascript using the {{%html %}} and {{%javascript %}} tags. It can be used on any template using the import django.http.HttpContexts.loaders , and can be imported alongside from django.template.toolkit . Temporary files One problem that we heard about in our previous Django 1.9 release was how to handle temporary files such as images. For example, this is how you can upload a .gif image file from disk to a disk image host: upload( 'myimg.gif', 'my_app_file_name@foo.png', media_type='image/gif', name='myfile' ) That works great if you have a lot of small image files, but if you have a big site with many image files, then it can get tricky. We recommend you use either the django.template.tempdir package, or the django.template.tmp module, depending on your application. Both of these are documented on the Django docs site under django-templating-utils, django-templedirs and django-templating-engine respectively. New user management For many users, the last thing they want to deal with is the complexity of adding a user to a Django database. We've included tools to make it easier to add, modify and delete users without worrying about the internals of the framework. We started off by introducing the auth_user helper that can be used in two ways. The first is to make a Django model instance with user information and use it as a user: from django.contrib.auth.models import Meta class MyApplicationUser ( models . Model ): address = models . CharField ( max_length = 15 ) birthday = models . DateTimeField ( auto_now_add = True ) The second use case for auth_user is to add a User object that can't be stored in an existing table, and that is stored instead in the admin database. from django.contrib.auth.models import Meta class MyApplicationAdminUser ( admin . ModelAdmin ): user = User . objects . create ( name = 'myappuser' ) There is also the auth_register and auth_regist methods to add and manage users in the admin database. These make use of the same functions you would call if you were adding a user to an existing model. New authlib The most significant new component of Django 1.10 is a new set of APIs and views that enable you to get authorization information from users. It's a powerful way to authenticate users in your application in a more simple and efficient way than the existing auth system in Django. For more details check out the auth.html specification. Password changes For users the primary problem facing them when using the django admin is updating passwords and passwords files. This new feature lets you provide an error when a password has changed while you are editing a password file. The update.save_exceptions setting defaults to False , which is a more convenient default. With the new functionality a password can be updated while another action is happening in the same session. For example a user can use the password field, update a password for that file and then save the saved file. This can simplify the process of editing a password file. django.contrib.auth.models import DjangoCookieAuth from django.contrib.auth.fields import PasswordChangeField from django.contrib.auth.models import RequestProxy from django.contrib.auth.utils import get_preflight_data set_preflight() class PasswordChangeField ( PasswordChangeField ): model = PasswordChange	0
The city and the state are taking a look at how to use the revenue from the sale of beer and wine as tax revenue. On Tuesday, the council's finance committee voted to study selling off the state's liquor sales. The committee also approved an ordinance to use the beer sales in the city's bond measure. Beer is not taxed in the state. The city currently has the authority to tax it. Alcohol sales have been rising across the state. There are plans to spend $100 million on adding 1,600 to 2,000 more liquor licenses.	0
After a brief hiatus, Pizzagate has resurfaced. Some are claiming it's an example of the elite using conspiracy theories as a means of control, even though most members of the elite have yet to make any actual claims about the theory. Others are claiming it is yet another instance of media hysteria — yet again, an argument that the elites themselves would never utter. Pizzagate, which is being called a "coverup" by some and a smear campaign by others, was the subject of an article in the Washington-based magazine The Hill on November 22, 2016 . The article was written by Michael Tracey. Tracey writes: "It is the belief of many that the Democratic National Committee was somehow involved in a massive, coordinated pedophile ring targeting the DC-area pizza chain Comet Ping Pong. "The claims that the pizza joint harbored a child abuse ring run wild on message boards, alternative news sites and Reddit, with one poster going as far as to say that 'the pedophiles have taken over the Democrats.' A YouTube user with the handle Comet Ping Pong Pizza shared a "selfie" with the logo of the restaurant and the statement, 'Pizzagate Facts,' before it was taken down, and then re-uploaded using a different logo to show the same logo with the hashtag #pizzagate. Other photos, videos and text sharing Comet Ping Pong's connections to a satanic pedophile ring are widely available. "But the conspiracy theory goes further: the restaurant has been used as a brothel for wealthy DC-area men who want to have sex with underage girls…Pizzagate is the most popular topic on a Reddit forum called r/The_Donald, where it has been discussed since March 2016 before a top moderator deleted comments and banned members as a precautionary measure. "While many are skeptical, there is abundant photographic evidence of Comet Ping Pong's pedo imagery, which can be seen on the pizzapizzagate wiki. "Even President-elect Donald Trump weighed in to accuse the restaurant of doing 'what we call in Washington bad and illegal things': "I heard many bad and disgusting things about Ted Cruz, but when I hear 'little Marco,' I think of my daughters — nothing but love! Ted Cruz is bad!" In response, a video from the "Pizzagate" subreddit titled "The D.C. Madam" was posted on November 23, 2016. "I wanted to see how many people here still believed that we are in fact the victims of a pedophile ring run by the DNC," the video begins before a woman named Samantha M. writes about her experience working at a restaurant called Comet Ping Pong. "If you did not believe this and were still in a state of shock and disbelief, I would really appreciate it if you stayed tuned. I wanted to show you the very, very disturbing, shocking proof that we are not in fact talking about a child sex ring here!" After the woman describes the alleged sex abuse she received and says she hopes this will make people think about the allegations, a voice from a video camera says "Goodbye. Thanks for watching." The full video, which was posted on November 15, 2015, can be seen for yourself here. It features some of the best commentary from Pizzagate supporters who have taken the time to watch it in its entirety and offer commentary. It also includes commentary from a different person who was allegedly a "private investigator who took the time to investigate" and claim the videos were "fabricated." The man, identified in the chatroom as Matt Forney, also claims in the video that "it is the establishment itself that is the target of these allegations." "I'm very confident that we found this place and we found everything we were looking for." The comments section of Forney's video begins with his video claiming that he and his team of private investigators have been given "the keys to the investigation." He then goes on a very detailed explanation of what he says the establishment has done to ensure pedophilia doesn't run rampant. "I'm also going to show you that there is no pedophilia happening at Comet Ping Pong," he says. "It's all fake news…I'm very confident that we found this place and we found everything we were looking for. You're welcome. This is a free country so I can say it." The other man who allegedly created the video, dubbed Matt Forney, had been tweeting about the conspiracy theory for over a week before his tweet about an old tape appeared on November 15, according to Alex Jones . According to The Daily Bell a former staffer of Jones, Matt Forney was fired for not being an alt-right extremist. This man also appears to own the website Infowars , which has been promoting Pizzagate since the beginning. The videos are also currently on YouTube and several have been viewed more than	0

[bitcoin-dev] Why is BIP100 not signaling for BIP148? Hi Peter, I think I understand what Gavin is saying correctly, but this is not what I want to say here... I thought we were in agreement that miners and nodes need to do at least the BIP141 activation (BIP141 in this case). Now, in order to make the activation possible, miners should make all blocks that have a BIP148 sig signature on them by the October 23 date. I think this would give the BIP141 nodes enough time to accept a new main chain in favor of the BIP148 Segwit2X nodes. So I want to ask whether this would not be a mistake on the part of the mining community. If BIP141 is activated, there will be a BIP141 node that refuses to accept any blocks with a BIP148 sig signed on them. So, if a miner does that, it would not force another chain to win. But for BIP148, as Gavin says, if a BIP149 node refuses to accept a block containing it, this would mean that at least one BIP149 node has a BIP148 chain by default, which is not what miners or the network wants. If we do get to a situation where an older BIP148 node refuses to accept a block containing a BIP148 sig, perhaps someone will find an older chain with a valid validator ID smaller than BIP148 that would allow the node to accept and relay those blocks. Also, I think we should talk seriously with both sides of this debate to determine which is in the best interest. Mike Belshe - 1HrGc9yXdFzPvxG8g3QrvLwX2Jk6YUy	0
In his book, "Unfettered" (Focal Press, 2011), Stephen Covey has an article where he takes stock of the cultural transformation that has happened to women and how little we take into account that our behavior and attitudes are a direct byproduct not only of the cultural change, but also of our genetics and biology. I would strongly believe that we have to take some responsibility for our lifestyle if we want to be successful and happy. You may be surprised at how little you are aware how far a mile from the ground you really are.	0
The latest news from the #SkepticalScience blog reveals the new face of climate change scepticism. That is, with the decline for the most recent year and the rise of deniers (in all shades and shapes), we now have a group of sceptics who reject the very thing that they claim to be fighting against: man-made climate change. They even admit that denying that climate change is man-made is no better than being a "closet climate change denialist". The new face of the skeptics is David Archibald who's been labelled a "climate denier" by Skeptical Science: It's not all good news, though. Skeptics are also embracing the use of denial science when it can be shown to be helpful to their own position of the truth of climate change. One prominent example of this is the "no global warming for 18 years" campaign led by Michael Mann. Archibald has a long history of promoting denial science. In 2010 he appeared on The Daily Show and called climate change a Chinese hoax, stating: "No, we're not living through a scientific revolution." But in 2010 the Australian Skeptics Network (ASN) found him in the comments section of Skeptical Science. In comments he said of climate change: "The Earth has been warming steadily for the past 150 years and most of the observed warming has been caused by burning of fossil fuels. So climate change theory is a load of crap." Archibald has also admitted to having a long history of supporting climate change denial, "having written at least three essays in response to recent peer review papers that have challenged the basic tenets of our understanding of climate science". While he denies his own climate change denial history, it has been exposed by numerous sources. He has also been accused of having taken money from anti-climate change organisations and having accepted substantial funding from the Australian mining industry. To date they've found only one thing he has taken public funding from, the Australian Mining Association. Their latest blog post is a response to a story in The West Australian newspaper on their recent appearance at the CSIRO. They say: [T]he claims against us in the article are a series of lies with the sole intent of destroying the Skeptics' reputation. We will never hide from a debate with people and this one is not a debate. We will not allow this to continue. These people are not people we are interested in debating or have a relationship with. We have no desire for this to become a story in the media about our views on global warming. If the truth is good enough for everyone, they should be good enough for us. They are not. The truth shall prevail. The Skeptics' views on climate change have advanced beyond those of the majority of Australians over the past decade. There are some people who hold these views, but they are in the minority. Skeptics do not accept that climate change is a hoax. We believe that global warming is happening. We believe that human activities over the past century are the main cause of most of the warming since the late 19th century. The majority of Australians believe global warming is happening. So, the Skeptics think that they have a right to hold a view that is not the majority of our community, which is why many of us have engaged in public debate and have called for the government to do something about global warming. These people are not people we are interested in debating or have a relationship with. We have no desire for this to become a story in the media about our views on global warming. If the truth is good enough for everyone, they should be good enough for us. They are not. The truth shall prevail.

The government of India recently made a decision to ban sale of all smartphones running Google's Android operating system. That is likely to affect Android-based devices used by the Indian mobile phone market. The move is reportedly made in line with India's decision to block import of Samsung's smartphones in India. India's move may be a reaction to the growing popularity of Apple's iPhone, according to the Economic Times. An Indian court has rejected Apple's application to import the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus into India in April, and then again in September, citing "anti-competition" reasons. The ruling was announced in the case, Appancom Pvt. Ltd. v. Union of India & Ors., which is awaiting trial in India. According to a report sent to The Wall Street Journal last month, Apple has been importing iPhones in India and selling them at a low price. Apple's iPhone sales to India are estimated to be around $1 billion per year. The smartphone market in India grew 13.3 percent to 50 million smartphones in 2014 from 41.6 million in 2011. Smartphones in India will become even more popular, as Apple's iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus are expected to be the best sellers in India next year as Samsung's recent recall of its Galaxy Note 3 device, which was launched two years ago and sold very well, shows. Apple has not publicly commented on the decision or what the government of India has done about it, so it may be a combination of two things. Apple has not publicly commented on the decision to ban its phones on Indian soil. One possible reason: the Indian government does not actually own the patents for the iPhone 5 and iPhone 5c that Apple has been importing into the country from China, as that device is covered by a trade agreement for local telecommunications companies. The Indian government and trade partners do own the patents for two other iPhone models, which might have triggered the ban. The government's own rationale for the ban would be to protect manufacturers from foreign competition, something that Apple would want to avoid with its Android devices. The fact is, Indian manufacturers will not lose out to foreign companies in India. Indian consumers would be much better off when the government bans all imports of the Android devices into the country. Apple does not have an issue with Indian companies operating in Indian markets like Airtel or Idea. Apple actually has a strong presence in India. It sells iPhones in India, while Google sells many Indian smartphones on its Android app stores. The ban on Android-based smartphones seems more likely to affect the companies manufacturing devices that run on Google's smartphone operating system. The government of India probably thinks it is too difficult to operate a company making devices that run on a different operating system. The government of India seems to be trying to regulate Android devices to keep them off the country's markets, according to a report earlier this week. The same report said that the government's anti-competition department has launched a probe to determine whether Google's Android devices pose an "imminent threat" to Indian phone manufacturers. Apple has been operating Android devices in Asia for almost two decades and is a significant player in India; the company has a large Indian retail store network and provides a number of services such as a free voice and data plan to users. In March, Amazon.com Inc. reported that it shipped 1 million Prime members' items by way of Apple's iCloud service.	0
Cape Town - The EFF has made progress with its negotiations with the ANC, said MP Dennis du Plessis. "In the last six months we've seen some positive signs and I have to say there's some good news in the talks. There's still a long way to go, but we are moving towards a resolution," du Plessis told News24. "I believe what President Zuma [is] saying is that he is going to be very pragmatic in making any sort of decision to support democracy in South Africa. "We hope that that will show once and for all that the country will be a stable democracy." The EFF has called for three key demands in its negotiations with the ANC to resolve the issue of the Nkandla fire. The party would like to see increased transparency over the commissioning of the Nkandla fire; the commissioning of a full audit of the security in the presidency; and for the ANC to issue an unconditional apology to Eskom for the damage caused to one of its own substations. Du Plessis told News24 that he did not believe ANC officials did anything wrong, but the party was unwilling to address public outrage over the issue. Du Plessis said he welcomed the ANC agreeing to a "truth commission" in order to address the issue of the security breach in Nkandla which saw guards and vehicles being brought inside the home of President Jacob Zuma. Du Plessis also said the party wanted to hear from the president's chief of staff Mac Maharaj, and the defence department, on why the party believes the army did not respond properly when the situation at Nkandla appeared to be deteriorating. Nkandla is a sprawling golf course complex in Nkandla, in KwaZulu-Natal, near Durban. The complex is owned by the president and his family. The ANC's provincial executive committee has recently held its first conference in Durban, and will meet again in March to discuss its executive committee's plans for the party's state of play at the state level.	0
Samantha Bee has been on the warpath against Fox News since she was a guest on the cable news network's "Full Frontal" last October. During an interview with the hosts, the comedian slammed the cable channel and its hosts for being part of the "alt-right." "The big news we have in the last 10 days for our side in the [Trump] movement is that the Fox News Channel has decided to be more of an 'alt-right-friendly' kind of network, because that's all the Fox News channels are, right?" Bee said in the November 28 "Full Frontal" installment of her "Full Frontal" special. Bee has been speaking up against what she calls "fake news" outlets for some time. This was not the only time that Bee ripped on Fox News and its hosts for being part of the "alt-right." A recent episode of her web series "Full Frontal" featured her talking to "The O'Reilly Factor" host Bill O'Reilly about the network's ratings issues. She even went so far as to say that the network should cancel its weekend shows in favor of hosting "The Resistance Week." "You know the last 10 days are kind of scary." Bee said. "The Fox News Channel has lost 40 percent of their viewers since you came onto the air. Why? Because they are so much against our side." The two-time Emmy-nominated actress is not alone in her disdain for Fox News. A recent survey conducted by Public Policy Polling showed that Fox News was the most despised network in the country. The survey had 27 percent of respondents rating the network's programming positively and 33 percent saying the same about their view of Fox News, and another 27 percent who believed they had not even heard of the network. "The Fox News Channel is the single most powerful media asset in the GOP's arsenal. And it's not just the party apparatus that can't be swayed by a single Fox segment," said PPP researcher Michael Smith.	0
The United Nations said it will no longer accept Palestinian prisoners as interns in the organization, because of their participation in Hamas terror. "We don't need interns," said Dr. Peter Maurer, acting head of the Geneva-based International Committee of the Red Cross, at the World Union for Social Development's World Economic Forum in Abu Dhabi Tuesday. "They are prisoners of war. They have served their sentence. We have enough interns at home who can represent this organization for us. So we have decided that we will no longer accept interns," the UN humanitarian official explained. The UN agency's internship program, which is paid, currently has more than 2,000 interns, said Maurer. Palestinian prisoners and human-rights activists are calling for the suspension of internships, saying the practice is an "opportunity for abuse," according to the New York Times. Maurer added that some interns are "untrained and poorly trained" and "can't handle it, at least, not properly." Maurer also called for the UN to stop paying other countries "exorbitant" fees for its workers, in part because of the money it can be making out of the Palestinian Authority. It is believed the organization spends hundreds of thousands of dollars in each Palestinian intern. "How dare you take advantage of the Palestinian people!" Palestinian activists wrote on Facebook. "You are the murderers! You are terrorists! You are liars!" The UN is a key player in the Palestinian territories and has been criticized by both the Israeli authorities and Palestinians for allowing the continued operation of the Hamas terror group, which rules the Gaza Strip. The UN was also caught using children as "human shields" at a recent Gaza tunnel evacuation.	0
I have a confession. I know that no woman has ever told me she'd love to be a porn star. That's because I have no interest in being a porn star. I would never even consider it. But I'm not alone. There are millions of women who have the same thoughts, and who are waiting in the wings. And when it comes to porn, the industry has been notoriously bad about supporting, even acknowledging, the needs of women and sex workers. The porn website Pornhub recently published porn actresses' salaries. They were divided into three categories: top performers, most popular performers and the porn stars who "made their living" in the business. The top performers earned around $17,000 for performing in an average video. The women who "made their living" included the top women earning $30,000 or more. Porn stars who "made it" (even for a short time) earned less than the lowest average female performer and more than the highest average male performer. Porn stars who "made it" were those who made a certain amount of money—say $50,000—in a year. These women were deemed to be "bigger than the average girl," which in porn is often defined as being able to take care of her family or get a "guy." Despite the fact that women are at their sexiest during their menstrual cycle, they are also paid less than men who perform the exact same job. One website estimated that in 2010, women were compensated for their work in the industry at around $6,000 per scene. And the typical sex worker has sex four times a week, on average. A report by Prostitution Research and Education found that male performers who are paid an average of $35,000 per film and female performers who make an average of $15,000 per tape earn considerably more. One performer had to "work seven days a week and earn $300,000 just to make a decent salary," reported The Daily Beast in 2012. In 2010, a report by Prostitution Research and Education found that female performers who make an average of $15,000 per video and male performers who make between $10 and $20,000 per film earn considerably more. These are the types of numbers that most people might think would have women in a panic. But there's good reason for porn performers' salaries to be so low and hard to predict. Porn stars have long been expected to be less than perfect. "You can't ask a young girl to work with a camera on her face, and you can't expect sex with a camera to be the most arousing thing she's ever seen," one performer told me. One performer I interviewed, who had worked in porn for over 10 years, said, "There is no such thing as a 'real' porn star; you have to find one within [the parameters] dictated by your porn director." In the "real" world, men make more and women less. Sex workers aren't allowed to have lives outside the work they do. For many of them it's impossible to imagine being able to be any other job. In many states, they can be fired simply for being who they are. "This industry is an industry of slavery, and I refuse to be used as a commodity," a porn performer named Amber told me in 2011. "If people know about this industry, there are more options for you. You can be an accountant, a schoolteacher, a lawyer, etc. The fact that [the industry is] still around means that it's still being held in place by the same old men who created it, so you can expect to have the same conditions. And the people paying you have the right to be fucked and to be used as little as they want to you, so if you are dissatisfied with your position, you should find another job." This was a statement I heard repeatedly in my conversations with porn performers: Even if they were paid a fair wage, they would likely not find another job. That is the reality of the porn industry. But that wasn't my own experience. I grew up in a world without porn. Porn started to exist for me in high school, in the form of the porn videos my grandfather handed down from generation to generation. In the 1970s, when his father was still in the business, porn movies were shot in low-budget, amateur "amateur" movies. My grandfather was the only studio employee—the cinematographer, the assistant directors, everyone else was just a regular dude. When I was 18, I discovered porn for myself. I found my first scene on Pornhub. Within a few days, I had a thousand people hitting my "likes" page on Facebook. And I immediately knew I needed to get out of my town.

BANGKOK — The United Nation's top human rights watchdog warned Thailand on Thursday that security forces had abused detainees under an intensified crackdown on dissent and the rights to privacy, association and peaceful assembly in a bid to curb the influence of the city's radical red shirt movement. As President Junta leader Prayuth Chan-ocha's government has pushed police and security forces to tighten their grip on public gatherings, the human rights office of the United Nations said it was concerned for the safety of the world's most populous nation as it pursues the Red Shirts. In a report that drew criticism from rights groups, the U.N. special rapporteur for human rights in Thailand said police had used "unlawful methods" and were using "discrete violations" to target the Red Shirts. The report said authorities had targeted Red Shirts who opposed the military government, but also used force against those who had peacefully gathered on a sidewalk and then moved into public spaces or blocked traffic. In some cases, those detained had had their homes raided without warrants or had their assets confiscated. "All the security forces in Thailand should immediately cease the use of unlawful means, including force, by exercising the utmost restraint and carrying out impartial investigations, in compliance with the law," it said. "The special rapporteur urges the Thai authorities to take immediate measures to prevent and to redress all violations of the right to assembly." The U.N. report came after the human rights rapporteurs on Tuesday expressed severe concern for the safety of a lawyer and a political activist detained in the city of Pathum Thani, south of Bangkok, because of suspicions they were members of the Red Shirts. Both men were released. Police and other security forces have also detained demonstrators there, and an Amnesty International statement said they were being used by the military as "human shields." Security forces are conducting sweeping sweeps of Bangkok and other major cities in what analysts say appears to be a crackdown on the Red Shirts. The United Nations report called for a swift investigation into the deaths and torture of detainees, saying the government's initial response "has been inadequate" and the "systemic failures of the law enforcement authorities" must be addressed. It made eight recommendations, including creating a mechanism to protect rights activists from harassment and intimidation by the security forces. The report came a day after a Red Shirts member was killed outside of Bangkok's Victory Monument over the weekend in the latest wave of bloodshed and repression of the movement. More than 40 Red Shirt supporters were arrested in Bangkok on Wednesday after the demonstration. The Red Shirts have sought to distance themselves from violence, saying they have no affiliation with members of the outlawed Red Shirts Battah political group, which is closely linked to the red shirts. But several deaths and several attacks since 2008, including two at military-government rally sites last year, have implicated Red Shirts and the red shirts. The Thai police have previously said that they were concerned about the impact on tourism if Red Shirts supporters were able to gather in large numbers in key locations across the nation. A recent decision by the government to close off Bangkok's famous Chao Phraya Riverfront to foot traffic has complicated security plans. Protesters are also concerned about the safety of foreigners in downtown Bangkok, saying they feel vulnerable when they walk the street. U.N. officials said one of Thailand's most prominent opposition politicians, Suthep Thaugsuban, will go on trial later this month after being charged with insurrection, leading violence and conspiracy against the state. He has rejected the charges as politically motivated. Mr. Suthep, who faces allegations he helped plan the 2007 coup that ousted Thailand's elected government, has frequently criticized the military and the government. Mr. Prayuth, the former army chief, has defended his government's crackdown on the Red Shirts and said the Red Shirts "are dangerous people, so we have to deal with them." Critics have accused the military-run government of attempting to destroy the opposition movement through a relentless campaign of arrests since it came to power in the 2014 coup. The U.N. report called on authorities to ensure there was a speedy trial and to provide sufficient space for any potential appeal of the case of Mr. Suthep, which would go to the country's highest court. "The United Nations will continue to closely follow the situation of the case of Suthep Thaugsuban," the report said. The U.N. also called on the Thai authorities "to immediately permit independent observers to observe the trial at all stages and to provide guarantees that the trial be conducted in a fair manner, that all due process rights are respected, the accused have an effective right to defence, and all proceedings are conducted in a manner which promotes public confidence in the security forces." The government on Thursday dismissed the criticism of the crackdown, with national security spokesman Maj. Gen. P	0
In a few days or months you might get some of the coolest equipment you can carry. I've written a few posts about the stuff. I've had a chance to see an AR15 build and even see what someone had built and test fire it at SRA. But today I'm going to be showing you how to build your own light stand using a piece of 2×4. It only takes 20 minutes and requires no skills. I'll show you the equipment and method I used, but the stand was built and tested by a guy named Mark in the comments, if you can spare the time and want to learn a little more about this, here's a link. What You Need I have to be honest — I don't want to write something this time of year just to do it. I'd rather focus on the future and things that are on the horizon. But, there are so many incredible new projects, tools, and gear that are just out there. So, I thought I'd do my duty, and share a few items that I've been using. 1. I need three 3/8″ wood screws. 2. I need a metal screw. If you don't have one in your house, you can get 3/16″ metal screws from Amazon. I don't have any specific ones. 3. You need drill bits (any variety will work, you only need about 9-12). How It Works What you've got here is a 2×10 frame and two 2×4 pieces. The frame uses 4 1/8″ screws on one side and 10 1/4″ screws on the other side. The middle 4 1/8″ screws that come together lock them into place. Now, you can use a piece of 1×6 that's long enough to wrap around the middle of the frame and screw them in place. This works pretty well for me, but you can also just lay the frame flat on a table and screw everything in with screws. You can also just cut a piece off the end of a 2×12 shelf that has two 1″ shelf brackets. I'd probably just get a large 4 1/8″ piece of board for this. I found these screws on a Home Depot site called Amazon. I bought all three sizes and I ended up having a couple leftover (they were only $1 each). You may find cheaper screws, but if you want a strong and rigid setup you're going to need the best. I cut out all of the 3/8″ wood board I needed to fit the 2×4s and assembled everything to see what it looked like: The parts I cut out fit well together and there should be enough clearance to put the battery and charging cable through. I'll show some pictures of how I did that later. In order to hold the batteries, I put a 1.5″ diameter foam board in the corners of the frame and cut out 1/4″ plywood on the backside to act as a backing. The boards need to be close together so they don't collapse. There probably could have been an easier way here, but I really didn't want to screw it all in because that would make it really heavy (if it even would). I only screwed in the bottom 1/4″. Next, I took an 18 inch long 2×4 and cut it up into four 4′ length (it was 2×4 and 2×6 at the same time and this allowed me to reuse 1/4″ bolts and go with 16-18″ long boards). I put all of the 4′ boards into a 3/4″ plywood frame, then I took one 1/4″ plywood and cut it up into two 1/4″ boards. I screwed all four pieces together. I also cut 2″ pieces of 1/4″ plywood that were 6″ long to cover the front side of the batteries. The bottom of the battery compartment needs to be able to accommodate the cable. Because you're only going to put a small 3.6V battery in here (if anything at all) there isn't a lot of room for cables going into the top. To solve that problem I used 4 1/8″ plastic cable ties. This was one of the cheaper and simpler cable ties you can get. You can try something cheaper or something more complicated. I bought them on Amazon. I just put a bunch of them on each corner (to tie everything together) and went to town. And that's kinda it! Now I have a complete, ready to shoot light stand that won't break the bank and could be easily modified and added to a lot of other pieces. It's a great little lightweight light stand and could be a good way to get started with DIY. I've been using this from day one on my AR-15 and it's just as	0
Hugh Jackman has a lot of catching up to do. There's the new The Wolverine, and then the upcoming X-Men: Days of Future Past, which stars Jackman as Wolverine and Patrick Stewart as Professor X. Plus, the studio just finished wrapping production on the new X-Force. So that has to take some time, too. So what does the actor like to do when he's not making blockbusters like these? As a new Daily Show video points out, Jackman is a big fan of riding a skateboard, and he even rides a skateboard with a camera in it: "You just think of a lot of things when you're on a skateboard, but you have to look up and see everything on the board," Jackman said in the video. "And we always get a real kick out of the stunt guys. They're absolutely ridiculous, like, 'I can't believe you've done that, that's the biggest one you've ever done, come here and take pictures.'" But it was the fact that Jackman's wearing a GoPro that really piqued the attention of the video. "So, one of the cool things about the skateboard is they use the cam and it goes around your back," Jackman said. "So, when you're on a board it's a little bit like a surfboard where you're not really on the board so much of it's kind of your hands pushing it." Here's to hoping that skateboard footage from the forthcoming movie The Wolverine gets posted on YouTube by Jackman — but it'll have to wait until May. (via Daily Mail)	0
In the wake of Hurricane Harvey, San Antonio has a clear message for the federal government. City leaders held a press conference Wednesday afternoon as they asked the Army Corps of Engineers to reconsider its decision to deny their request for emergency federal funds. "It's heartbreaking, it's heart-rending it's ridiculous it's beyond words. And today, we have a chance to turn the page," Mayor Ron Nirenberg said. The Mayor says his City of Refuge was supposed to help communities recover from major disasters like Harvey but it's gotten much more than that. "Today, we've gotten a chance to turn the page and move off and do what the people of this state want us to do – be prepared for future disasters," Nirenberg said. According to the City of Refuge, the $100 million in federal money to help the City of Refuge recover from Harvey will help the City rebuild homes and pay for other expenses after Harvey. The City of Refuge would like to get the money from the United States Army Corps of Engineers and Nirenberg wants to use some of that money to help with the recovery efforts for Houston. Mayor Nirenberg is calling for an emergency meeting with the Army Corps of Engineers to see if there is a way forward. It should not take a federal disaster for Houston to rebuild. They are ready for it.	0
The World Rugby Sevens Series, held every three years, is an annual rugby international competition that combines the best rugby Sevens players from around the world. Teams from countries such as New Zealand, Australia, USA and the United Kingdom compete across four different divisions to score as many points as possible in a season that lasts only ten days. The series takes place under the World Rugby World Series banner. Format World Rugby Sevens Series tournaments are run as a knockout stage with teams competing for one of three separate prize pools: Top seed Participants in pool 1 qualify for semifinals Pool 2 plays in the other semifinal Pool 4 makes up the final Pool 1 Participants in pool 1 qualify for semifinals Pool 2 plays in the other semifinal Pool 4 makes up the final Pool 1 First Place The winner is awarded the prize pool, with any other teams that reach the semis receiving a bye in the semifinals Teams The World Rugby Sevens Series is played out across two categories of teams: men's and women's. Men's Series The men's series is an all-World Rugby Sevens Series tournament, played between October and December in a double-header format. This format features the first stage of the series, a round robin stage, followed by the second stage, a quarter-finals stage. Semifinals and Finals The round robin stage of the tournament is the first stage of the tournament. Semi-finals The semifinals feature top seeds, with winners from each division seeded into the semifinals. Pool play will continue with teams battling over pool 1 and pool 2 positions, with winners from each pool taking on the other in the winners' quarterfinals and championship. The winners of the semis play in the top seeds' semifinals. Championshames All the matches in the competition are played in September, starting in Melbourne on the weekend after the final tournament. The winners of each pool will play in a quarter-final, while the losers, after receiving the least number of points, fight for a place in the final. Afterwards, the quarter-finals and championship are played in Glasgow with the team with the most points winning the title. Women's Series In contrast to the men's series, the women's series has six teams (United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, USA and the Republic of Ireland) competing across three separate divisions. The women's division also introduces the concept of a knockout stage with teams qualifying for the playoffs based on a maximum number of points. Participants The World Rugby Sevens Series sees 16 women's teams join 12 men's teams in 12 countries for the competition. Teams are divided geographically based on seven points, with teams based on the Caribbean and South Pacific islands earning more points. The format of the women's tournament allows for greater individual variation and increased player interaction between teams. Teams in each division have nine players, whereas for each men's team, there is only allowed 10. Women and men are placed in separate groups at the start of the competition to maximise the amount of time available for training, with each team having three matches total. Format The tournament is played during September with an additional round of qualifying before the tournament commences in Glasgow in September 2018. Winning teams Each year the seven-team, knockout tournament features four semi-finalist and two winners and runners-up. Final stage The final stage of the season sees teams compete in nine group stages to qualify for the postseason where the winners in pool play take on runners-up in the championship. Schedule The World Rugby World Series is played in a round robin format with the top four sides in each division competing, all the way to the final. October: Championship Quarter Finals December: Semi-finals February: Championship Finals April: Playoffs Venue The World Rugby Sevens Series takes place at a combination of venues across 12 countries, from Scotland to South Africa and Australia to New Zealand. Scheduled dates and venues (all times are local): Australia, Canada, New Zealand, England, France, Ireland, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Scotland, Wales, Scotland, Wales, Wales, Wales.

A few years ago, I took a day trip from Portland, Oregon, to Bali. I was excited to do some hiking, have a few hours at a resort, and relax in the sun. What I didn't realize, when I got out of the airplane and crossed the border into Bali, was that I would be spending a lot of time in the company of women on that trip. Bali's beautiful beaches were full of young women who were so much more attractive, graceful, and fun to be around. And yet, Bali was also extremely conservative; it's hard to find a place you can relax and live my life, and relax and live freely when a woman can't be around. That's why it's so important that Bali's tourism industry is male-dominated. The tourism industry has a huge business in female clientele, because women are known to travel more on their own and get to know people more. Bali has only one night spa, and the only woman in business whose name I can find working in it is the owner's daughter. The rest of the business is male. So, the men get to do pretty much whatever they want: They can get a massage, go to the beach, or go snorkeling if they love the sea. And they can also get the best deals of any tourist destination anywhere, while women are stuck trying to find a massage parlor in a place where there are literally no male masseurs. The irony of this situation was not lost on me. After I arrived in Bali, I visited all the places I was told were "good" for women, but I didn't find any of those places. I didn't find massage parlors, I didn't find women's lingerie shops, I didn't even find bars where men could have a drink and talk about women to me. The city in search of the ideal female face, has found itself surrounded by people who know exactly where that face is supposed to be. But the other side of that coin is that women have much higher standards for places they visit on their own. Bali is pretty liberal here, and yet, the women and I couldn't find a single place to get a massage or take a dip while we were there. The only place with decent women's products seemed to offer an average massage, and that was a bit of a disappointment after I had gone to other places in the area that were much more affordable. So I came to the conclusion that Bali tourism is a business built around the needs of men: Women in Bali don't want to go there or feel comfortable there; the places that women come to need to feel inviting to women, and must also be easy to get to, and most importantly, must cater to everyone except women. If I wanted to have a good time in Bali, all I had to do was stop getting my hair braided in Bali, and no one would have been the wiser. And because most of the hotels in Bali are men's-owned and operated, no one even seems to know that they aren't the best options for women. It's as if no one wants female customers. I spent all day thinking about how all this played out in my own life. It was my first time to visit Bali, so I had a good feeling about the place. I was excited that there was something new to see, new art, fresh cuisine, new experiences from the island. But in the end, I discovered that Bali is a men's adventure capital.	0
A "man-shaped" device which can turn electricity and light in the air into motion has been described as the "most beautiful" device to emerge from the field of "crystal manipulation techniques". The tiny device generates electricity when heat is applied, and that same heat can generate light. The discovery suggests that the properties of quantum physics, the fundamental underpinning of physics, may hold promise for transforming energy sources. The work is described as "truly brilliant science", by one of its creators. "The most beautiful device of its kind to emerge from the field of crystal manipulation techniques is described and the method of generation of heat is explained as to why the heat is generated," said Professor Eric Klopfer from the University of Waterloo in Canada, who led the work.

I'm always delighted when the opportunity to interview a game designer who is active in community outreach. When you have the opportunity to have the designer show us some of his or her work at a conference we take it. It's like having time with an old friend and hearing them reminisce. With that in mind, I was recently contacted by the talented folks who run the blog, and who also run a very generous Patreon, Gamers Heroes, to interview one of the most visible members of the gaming community – Jon Gilmour. The interview has been lightly edited for length, so go ahead and read it if you have some time on your hands. How did you come to be a games designer? Were you into board games in high school? Any interests in other games? Jon Gilmour: This is a good question – I never played a game I made until college. I was interested in computers at birth though, and by the time I got older I took up computers for work, not gaming. I made a basic "toy computer" when I was 12, in hopes that it might be of use someday (I was a math major, so I would have had to figure out a way to play it). It took me a couple of years to try programming, then I picked up other computer arts as a hobby. Do you think your current work influences other designers? Do you see similarities in the work you do? Gilmour: I have no control over what other designers do, and I didn't do it for this kind of influence, even though I have a deep appreciation for how other people might work, not only for design but for game design as a whole. I find my influences to be many, including games like Myst (which influenced early games like Ultima), King's Quest, The Bard's Tale and of course SimCity, all of which I enjoy, and that have influenced me enormously over the years. In fact the way one of my recent games has managed to find success (aside from not being a "soul crushing" simulation game like everything else out there…) was pretty remarkable… it wasn't anything I'd written explicitly or consciously. So, what do you consider your favorite games to work on, or your favorite game companies to be working with? If you're working with someone, what does that mean and how does working with that particular person affect your design process? Gilmour: As far as games going, I think what I'm happiest about is getting the chance to create unique experiences. I'll be honest, it can be a challenge, and I want to keep pushing myself to find new ways of solving those problems. I also find the process of working with companies with interesting challenges. The fact, that there always seems to be something new to work on, and yet never to know what it's going to be until you see it in development, makes it a good place to get into as a designer, and to try out concepts. So, what's next for you? Where are you working in terms of game design and publishing? Will you ever design a game of your own? Gilmour: I really enjoy working with other designers. One of the ways I've approached my work since I started is to put out an idea and find out if other people are interested in what it is. I think the idea, and I hope the people who are interested in it, will find a way to combine my experience with theirs in order that my ideas become reality. My current project, called HAWT is a game that is inspired by a lot of things – a lot of different games, and a little bit of some more recent and "tribal" games. It's about a warrior in the midst of an assault on a tower that holds an enormous stone block. The player is trying to survive, to get through the onslaught of various enemies. I think if anyone has an interested in doing something similar, there's a lot of interesting ways to make it feel distinctive, unique, and "mechanical". Do you feel you've come a long way since the very first video game you wrote about, "I'm the King of Everything!", but have you found it difficult to stay within the realm of your art and still work as a programmer and designer? Gilmour: Oh man – it's crazy just how much I've worked. I've been around games since I was in college, even more now. I have a full time software development job, working on a couple different things that never quite come to fruition. There is often a great feeling that comes with having achieved something, but the more I play video games, and play the games I make it's always hard to resist those little "hints to something else" that keep hitting my head. The main difficulty has always been that it's difficult to make games that are as technically impressive as we would like them to be.	0
"I always felt that the best way for me to play this game was against guys I knew had a high ceiling," Matthews replied. "And I know that was a part of my life, especially when I was playing for the University of North Carolina and going through the ACC. Obviously, I got into the league and I played against a lot of great players like Steph Curry, Tony Allen, Chris Paul, all those guys. I went to their games and it taught me about myself. All of those guys had their own way of playing the game, they always found something good to do on the court. With the Spurs, all I knew was that I could be a good player at this level and I could make my teammates better."	0
"To all of the people who have told me to stay in school, I've told them to go fuck themselves," she replied to a question on her Twitter account today. A spokesperson, from the Labour Party, said: "We have taken the decision to stand down from our role at the General Election because the Labour Party will not be entering into another coalition with the Conservatives. We believe the best way to end austerity and bring an end to years of Tory chaos is a strong Labour Government." Shadow chancellor John McDonnell, who was tipped to be the party's future leader, said: "We will only be entering into a coalition with the Tories if it delivers a clear mandate from the British people to run our economy and borrow our way out of this mess. "Labour will work with other parties who share our values of social justice, strong public services and a fairer economy, to end the Tories' economic failure and bring change to our country. "Labour will stand up to the Tories, fight them over tax credits and stand up for the poorest in our society." Mr McDonnell said Labour was "not yet" ready to reveal its manifesto, or even provide "any detail on where we will find the £20bn we need to deliver a decent job and secure a secure retirement" but said that the party "will not be offering empty promises". He said Mr Cameron has "failed" over his deficit reduction pledges, and added: "We'll be providing a stronger, fairer society with a strong economy. The Tories don't get it - they are just pretending that they do." It comes as the Conservatives say they plan to double investment in the military to tackle the "deficit crisis" - yet have not provided details of their £36bn defence budget. The manifesto states the Armed Forces will "grow substantially", but it does not provide details as to how new spending is to be made. Shape Created with Sketch.

 If you are new to the world of vaping or the new kid on the block, or you have been a vaper for a little while but are curious about switching to e-cigarettes, then this article is for you. For some, it may be the ultimate tool in making a switch. We all have our favorite brands to smoke, so you may have to go with any one or some of them. However, your personal choice is only as good as the quality of the products that you buy. If you do not choose quality products and do not have a good reason for switching then you might be better off sticking with smoking, which is not necessarily healthier, but it is much more cost effective and it produces at least as good a quality of smoke. What makes an excellent electronic cigarette? You may be wondering how do I learn about the quality of the products available on the market. And there are plenty of quality brands out there, but as you would expect, they get more expensive in terms of your money. In this article, I will share to you the top 10 that I recommend you look for as possible replacements for those brands: 1. Smoker's Paradise or Innokin - If you are a smoker and are looking to switch to electronic cigarettes as a result of your habit being compromised, Smoker's Paradise are great products at a budget friendly price. The devices I get to smoke on are quite a bit nicer than any of those you would find for purchase from other manufacturers. Not only do they look good, but the taste is also excellent, as you will find out in this article. Not to mention, you get free shipping when buying them from Smoker's Paradise. There are only two problems with the products that I use - that being the small size of the cartridges that are available and that it can be rather difficult for my husband to load a cartridge while I am smoking. As for those who don't want to spend money, Innokin's eGo one is a nice product as well, but it can be a little pricey for a starter kit with all the accessories. However, there is the Innokin iTaste VV/VW Starter Kit which is much more affordable with a smaller size battery and a larger size atomizer. As for the other options, you have the Firefly series of products, which has a few different models; one of the best-selling is the TFV8 Lite, but the Firefly Series is great too with the TFV12 Gen2, TFV12 Rainmaker, and even the new TFV12 Prince. You can also find some cool options in the sub-$30 range, such as the Joyetech JUUL, M100, and the Kanger SUBVOD. Keep in mind that you must purchase at least one atomizer or cartomizer in order to use most of these devices. 2. X-Bow - X-Bow is the perfect example of a brand that you will see all over the web - it has a broad range of prices and even offers different types of tanks, such as glass and metal. Also, this e-cigarette brand offers several kits that include some accessories that will make your vape more convenient. X-Bow also allows you to upgrade the quality of your vapor as you progress through their product range, with new tanks, better atomizers and higher-quality cartridges. As a matter of fact, X-Bow is a top-rated brand that I recommend to anyone who wants to take charge of making a change. The prices are much more affordable than most the brands, as well. So, have you tried these 10 top brands? If so, which product(s) did you like? Tell me it was awesome and share on my Facebook page.	0
 Sally Yates, the acting attorney general, will provide evidence to the Senate Judiciary Committee in an upcoming appearance to explain her role during former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn's misleading conversations with the press. Yates confirmed in a statement Monday that she would be providing testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee, which has scheduled a hearing June 13, but offered no additional details about the matter, and referred the matter to the Justice Department. "When the United States government is notified that a person is subject to investigation, we need to thoroughly investigate that person's contacts and movements over time, particularly with foreign officials, to determine whether there is any evidence of a crime or criminal activity, and for that reason I have directed that the Department consider issuing a grand jury subpoena," Yates stated, according to USA Today. "As I have said, I believe that any investigation of this matter can be helpful to the President, as it provides an opportunity to resolve those questions." Yates was fired Thursday by President Trump, following Yates' refusal to answer questions from the White House on her knowledge of classified information regarding Flynn's communication with a Russian ambassador. Yates told the White House on Jan. 26 that Flynn had instructed the Trump transition team not to ask him questions regarding his contacts with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak. On March 22, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein appointed Robert Mueller to be the special counsel for an investigation into Russian involvement in the 2016 election. The Justice Department's announcement indicated that it was still working on the issues about Yates. Follow Chuck on Twitter	0
In a move that could lead to more than $50 million in new tax revenue, the California Taxpayers' Assn on Tuesday introduced a measure aimed at ending a tax break that the group says discriminates on the basis gender. The state law, which takes effect July 1, allows men to deduct from their state tax all child support payments, regardless of the amount paid or the legal outcome. Women and girls get no such deduction. That makes the exclusion of child support payments from an accountant's calculation of a couple's tax liability a double advantage, said the organization's executive director, Mark Baldassare. "They can just claim something on the side of the return that really does nothing for the income tax," Baldassare said. Women get no such tax break for alimony, spousal maintenance or child support payments the couple owes, according to the group. While both men and women might owe child support to the state, that's not the only way women might receive a break, Baldassare said. A husband, for instance, might receive a smaller share of his wife's income if the couple have separate jobs. The bill, which is being introduced by state Sen. Ricardo Lara of Bell Gardens, would require the state Department of Revenue to determine whether income and tax payments from two separate sources are sufficiently comparable to exclude tax deductions, he said. "A bill like that needs to be addressed, and this is a good first step," said Lara, who said it would not interfere with people receiving other tax breaks. "There are no winners here." He said he was inspired to write the bill by recent reports that revealed the tax deduction exclusion on spousal support payments has increased. The tax break, which is worth $7,000 to $30,000 in the first year, does get more expensive as a couple ages. To qualify for the tax deduction, women and girls must report a child support payment on their state tax returns. Some don't do so, Baldassare said, including some who can pay child support in cash and who may be unaware of how much they are receiving. To be sure, other states have similar tax measures designed to address the disparity, Baldassare noted, not just to help a woman who is paying child support and another partner whose income is low. But California currently has the most restrictive tax rule, Baldassare said, and "people who are eligible for it are the disadvantaged ones." The state must determine whether there are substantial differences in both the amount reported on the child support form and the actual income of the couple, he said. The amount of the deduction would depend on the income of the man, as well as the amount reported during their most recent calendar year on their most recent state return, according to the measure. In addition, the mother would be able to recomputate her payments to include a portion of any pay that was received as alimony or spousal maintenance from the second person, in the form of a tax deduction, the initiative said. Women are often unable to negotiate favorable terms when they are in the divorce process, said Baldassare. If the woman pays spousal, maintenance or alimony to someone other than her former spouse, her tax bill on the whole amount will not change, he said. But because that payment goes to the man's income on his returns, it will be counted as taxable income that falls within the family's current tax bracket. "Now the man is paying alimony or child support, yet he gets a tax deduction," he said. Under the proposal, the man could qualify for the same tax break based on his share of the payment. That means a woman who has just completed a six-year marriage and separated from her first partner in 2008 would now be able to claim the child support deduction without having to show she has spent the past six years working while she was married, he said. "We get married, and our child support payment is $300," he said. "Then you have that same child-support payment, but in another year the child-support payment jumps to $400 to $500. And a couple of years later you have to have over $1,000 to keep the child support deduction." California will be the latest state to tackle the issue this year, following Arizona and Illinois, which both passed child support reform measures last year. In Michigan, there was no change in the child-support deduction in last year's state budget. But the state legislature is expected to consider including it in the upcoming state budget. In Maryland, lawmakers last year approved a child-support formula measure that would allow men to deduct child support payments from their income. The measure was not in effect for most of last year because the bill's language was amended before it was to take effect. The revised language allows for tax deductions for child support	0
[Note 1] This document was first published in French in Revue d'histoire de P.M., and translated into English in the volume for 1927-28, pp. 579-98.  [Note 2] As far as the work of the Communist Party of France may be understood and assessed by the international proletariat today, it is essential for a clear insight into the conditions of socialist construction to be gained for the French proletariat, for it not only carries the responsibility of fulfilling its historical mission to the proletariat in all countries, but is the instrument for raising it to a higher level of consciousness and organization in the labour movement, while at the same time taking over the tasks which must be carried out, and for which France has to bear the entire weight.  [Note 3] There exists no single formula which expresses accurately the conditions which existed in the Soviet Union during the period of its construction. In the period of its struggle for existence, the Soviet Union was obliged to make a great many tactical maneuvers and to adopt many different tactics. The Communist Party of France must learn from the mistakes made in its international relations and in the relations between the working class and the Communist Party and also from the mistakes of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.  [Note 4] In this regard, the Communist Party of France, on behalf of its members in the Communist Parties and in the labour movement, presents to the Communist International a new French translation of a report in which the Comintern approved the draft program of the Second Congress of the Communist International, that is, the program of the Communist Parties that were elected to the Executive Committee at the Second Congress and also the draft program of the Third Congress of the Comintern.  [Note 5] According to the draft program of the Second Congress of the Communist International approved at the Eleventh Conference in the Kremlin on June 19, 1934, the Communist Parties should be linked directly and directly to the Soviets and the Soviet authorities. The Comintern proposed to have the Executive Committee direct all the Parties and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics with respect to all questions of international relations. The Comintern also proposed to appoint Cominform (that is, the Communist International) to lead all the Communist Parties in the world in foreign trade and finance, in international relations with colonies and semi-colonies, international organization of the working class, in the training of proletarian revolutionaries, in the struggle against the reaction, and in all spheres of social activity.  [Note 6] By means of its press and press offices, the Communist Party of France will continue to transmit to the working class all the communist news in French and will make it easier for the working class to learn the Communist Party's position and program of action and to participate in its activities.  * * * THE FIRST CONFERENCE OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY OF FRANCE Present: 10th and 11th October 1. We hold our First Meeting at the Headquarters of the Communist Party of the French Republic (hereinafter : "the headquarters," to distinguish the Communist International from the Communist Party of France). 2. The Meeting was called by the Communist International in order to have an investigation of the situation of the revolutionary forces in France. 3. The Meeting was held according to a programme adopted at the Eleventh Conference of the Communist International of November 9 to 15, 1934. With the approval of the Eleventh Conference the programme was agreed upon at the Eleventh Plenary Session and approved by the General Secretary of the Communist International. 4. The programme of the Meeting of the Headquarters was based on the following main principles: a. the political and ideological emancipation of the Communist Party of France from the influence of international reaction and its political and ideological dependence on the proletarian parties of the world; b. the consolidation of the Communist Party of France, in common with all the other Communist Parties represented at the Meeting, and their complete union, with the other Parties represented at the Headquarters; c. the liquidation of all opportunists, revisionists, and opportunist militants from the Party and its organizations; d. the complete subordination of the French Communist Party and the Parties of Communist World to the Communist International; 5. All decisions and instructions of the Meeting of the Headquarters were adopted by the General Secretary of the Communist International, the Executive Committee of the Communist International, the General Secretariat of the Communist Parties, all the Organizational Commissions of the Communist Parties and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, and were communicated to all the Parties. The Chairman of the meeting of the Headquarters had the right to vote in case of disagreement with a decision or instruction of the meeting of the central bodies of the Communist Parties, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, or of the Communist International, as well as to express his opinions in the following matters: a. the	0
The following script is from "The Fight Within" which aired on May 2, 2015. Lesley Stahl is the correspondent. Shari Finkelstein, producer. A federal judge in Manhattan has ruled that the Justice Department must turn over all documents related to the FBI's investigation into two Planned Parenthood clinics in St. Louis and Long Island. On Thursday, a three-judge panel of the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals sent the department a long list of new records, including records of any meetings between Planned Parenthood officials and federal officials. The decision could allow lawmakers to demand more information about how the agency investigated the clinics. Planned Parenthood says a grand jury cleared it of any wrongdoing last year. The American Civil Liberties Union also says its clients weren't prosecuted after the FBI investigated its St. Louis clinics in the 1990s. Planned Parenthood supporters have called this a victory and say it would be a huge help to their fight in Congress. The groups that took part in the lawsuit applauded Thursday's decision. What does the ruling mean for Planned Parenthood? It means now that this is in court, they'll get their day in court. They don't care how many years until they win. It's not about the case, it's about the fact that this will go into discovery. And then we'll have to go through them all. This means that any and all records will be put on the public record. We will never be able to say "Oh we never thought about this." "It is time for the Obama administration to finally come clean with the public and with congress about what it did and did not do," said Elizabeth Nash. Planned Parenthood says they can now release information about their clinics for the first time since 2007, but the organization is fighting for at least some of the documents they turned over last fall to the committee investigating Planned Parenthood. The group would release them if they won, and they don't give up -- in fact after Thursday's decision Planned Parenthood is planning to file a lawsuit so that they can keep some of the records. How is it possible that such a case has been sitting in court for over three years? The reason why this case has not been put on the public record is because the government has refused to acknowledge that this investigation happened, as I said. It has not said anything. Why aren't any records that were turned over in March when the committee said this were public? Because this committee requested all records related to this investigation that had been turned over by March of last year. The Justice Department refused to do this because it is trying to get around the public records law. They are trying to hold this information in secret so that politicians can never get them. They don't care about the public -- they want to hold these records in secret so that the people never know the truth. And the government won't release documents it says will embarrass Planned Parenthood or President Obama? No, not a word. They're not going to release any documents that would embarrass us or embarrass our patients. I have had my own problems with the Justice Department over the years. They never get a court order to release these documents. They're just holding them back for years. But now we have it. Once the judge signs off on the ruling we will be on the public record. And how far can the Department go now? They're no longer hiding documents. The judge signed off on that on Monday with an order to release at least some of these documents. Right now, we are not at liberty to say anything more than that we expect to be able to release a significant portion of these documents later this year. And they are the only federal court system that has the authority to do it. In addition, it has been our experience there is a high level of interest from the public in this case and this is why we are fighting them on the issue. What does our legal team want in response? We want the federal government to stop hiding documents, to make its records available to the American people and we want to be held accountable for what went on during this investigation. What the Justice Department says are the documents to release? We're confident that we have a majority of the documents that the Department believes we will be able to release at this date. We believe this will include all of the grand jury records, all of the records that were submitted to the grand jury, all of the notes taken by the assistant U.S. attorneys, all of the documents that the Justice Department made public. But it will also include records which the Department has not yet turned over. What does Planned Parenthood say? We are still waiting to receive those documents. We hope the judge allows us to see them now that we are on appeal. If we are denied access to those documents we will sue. Why now?	0
Tough times on the market for small-business owners Updated Small and medium-sized businesses are struggling to survive in the current economic context, new figures show. In the February quarter, small businesses' net profit fell by more than nine per cent to $14.8 billion, according to the latest Small Business and Family Enterprise Report by the Small Business Association (SBA). The annual report shows that business confidence remained low, unemployment remained high, there was an ongoing supply-side manufacturing slowdown and wages growth remained weak from the previous year. It also notes that wage growth has fallen to its lowest level since the March quarter of 2015. SBA chief executive Belinda Robinson says the situation has been exacerbated by negative factors such as declining global demand and lower commodity prices, the mining boom and low-profile trade deals such as Japan's free trade deal with the United States. "This report also illustrates the very real challenges small business owners and their families are facing," Ms Robinson said. "The current economic conditions, including the ongoing decline in commodity prices, which have hit many small businesses hard, are resulting in many small and medium-sized businesses being forced to curtail or close as part of their daily business operations. "These are business owners who are struggling with a growing number of suppliers unable to deliver goods. "A key reason for this, particularly for the small business operators experiencing difficulty, is the falling purchasing power of our national economy. "As our nation's economy continues to struggle to find a sustainable path to growth, we're seeing businesses and their customers facing many challenges, and this report makes clear the scale of the challenge."

Tired of waiting on long lines and a long lunch? You can now order food from your phone. While it's a pretty impressive solution for the average person on the go, it's something worth considering if you're an office drone. In reality, though, it could just be another convenience for the busy executive. Here's why. 1. It's just cheaper. With a smartphone, you don't have to worry about setting up a phone or making purchases online. But that's not the only perk. When you're buying a sandwich from a digital menu, the price for the sandwich is deducted from your credit card. To pay for it, you need to have a credit card to begin with, and if you don't, the purchase is refunded to your PayPal account and the order goes straight to your phone. 2. Not just fast, but reliable. This is an increasingly common scenario: You've got a phone but you're not exactly comfortable calling a real person. There are apps that connect you with a person, and most work just fine. The problem with these options is that most of them are also paid app services. When I need to pay a friend out of my pocket, I can go to their app; when I'm on a vacation or on vacation, a friend could be able to get me free hotels. I can't do that when I have to call my coworkers. 3. You don't have to be a business analyst. The app also lets you order products like pizza without having to be too tech-savvy. A couple more features on the way will let you purchase stuff that can't be delivered. The technology does all the heavy lifting, and you don't have to keep clicking your phone to wait in line. If you have a mobile office, you could even order pizza from out of the office, and use that to create some good, fast, free time by ordering pizzas for your team. 4. You can always pay with credit or PayPal. There are no monthly fees or credit monitoring. You simply order online and get paid off at the end of the month, regardless of what's in your account. You pay by the hour, and when a payment goes through, it's free. That means you can use it to go out to eat and buy something to go. 5. If you don't know how to use it, you can use a smartphone to book a restaurant. You have to set up the phone as a guest, though, and there are limitations. If the time you want to spend on a menu item is over four hours, you have to call ahead and confirm. 6. If you do know how to use the tool, you need to wait in line. Some orders actually take longer than an average day at lunchtime, so people often wait in line. I've ordered meals from a phone twice, and those didn't fare well. If you see a line, you can either wait until the order goes ahead, or get there before the line forms. Or you know a really cute waitress who might let you get in to order pizza. 7. You can cancel at any time after you've placed two orders. If you do cancel, you have to wait in line every time you come back. Your order remains in your card's memory, which means if you come back later, you'd have to wait a full day for your next order. It's only really fun for the first four or five times, however, so by that point it might be too late. 8. If you don't have a credit card, you can still do it from paypals.com. It's a service that allows people to pay each other. When I ordered pizza, it worked fine, but it was a bit inconvenient. I had to go to their website, sign up, and create a PPO account—and then it worked fine. If you like to try any new technologies, you can get a $25 Amazon gift card which will get you a pair of Bluetooth earbuds. Just head over to The Verge's office for an invite. UPDATE: We have reached out and the Verge is working on integrating this service into their existing app: a long wait, but we're excited to have a new way of ordering pizza and more options as we head into the coming years for technology.	0
You can find this recipe on the Tidy Mom blog here "I don't care what you think of me." And I want you to know that that was exactly the mindset of this poor little girl that is my mom. She was always so proud of her daughter and would say, "Oh, she's so proud of me!" But in reality, she was always so concerned with her daughter's self-esteem and self-image. And that made her mom so upset. She wanted her daughter to realize something to the point of her suicide. She felt embarrassed that she, despite having been a woman for the better part of her childhood, she never understood how girls felt when things didn't go their way. She would try to explain it to me when I was a kid, but I couldn't seem to understand that I had been wrong all of my life, and in so many ways, I hadn't been any different than the little girl that I wanted to be. I think she figured that since that little girl had been raised by a great dad that she would have a great dad someday. I am so so grateful that she didn't take her life. She did. But her poor little soul was crushed. She was so embarrassed and embarrassed all the years. She was so ashamed and ashamed the day my dad told her what he had overheard during a work meeting, but she didn't talk about it or accept that my dad had to tell her that. She had a daughter, and she was going to be a single mom. She wasn't going to be able to go home anymore. She was going to live as out with all of her friends who had kids as well. Her daughter wanted to be a mom. She didn't want to come home. She made no effort to help her daughter learn how to be a mom. She taught her to be independent. She taught my husband that she was the most wonderful, wonderful woman, and how wonderful she was. And she gave him that little doll and said, well, my daughter likes that doll. She was so proud of her, and I am sad to say that when it came time to have a little sister I never quite embraced. I don't know if I feel anything at all sad or bad now that she is gone. But I do know I have to be very cautious in the ways that she had passed on to her child so that my daughter doesn't feel like she is being shamed and marginalized for not getting married and having children. I have to be very careful about who is doing the shaming for her to feel good about what she could become in this world. My daughter needs to know that, regardless of where she is, if she is happy, then that's good enough. I just want my daughter to see people and know they are there for her. My daughter needs me, and my love, and to feel like I can be this strong, secure female, and that I can be here for her in any way that I need. That I wouldn't ever let my kid go without help. I want her to know that no matter what anyone else has done to her in the past or in her life, she is worth so much more. She was the perfect little girl, and I'm proud of her for that. She is the perfect kid, and I am proud of her for that. But you know what I think is important? My daughter is the perfect little girl. Because, in truth, no matter how ugly she gets, or how flawed she becomes, she is always worth more than anything. She is always worth more than anybody's hatred, or neglect or abuse or failure at life will ever be able to take away from her. She is forever. So I want my daughter to know that she is worth so much more than they will ever be able to take away from her. I want her to know that no matter what anybody else has done to her in the past or in her life, she is worth so much more than anybody's hatred, or neglect or abuse or failure at life will ever be able to take away from her. She is forever — not just as a child, with all of her potential, not just as a teenager, with all of her energy, but as a human being. She is worth being cared for and protected and given everything that she can possibly expect and deserve. She is worth feeling loved and appreciated for who she is and how amazing she is. She is worth being treated with the fullness of the love from those who love her. She is worth being held safe and loved, and protected, and celebrated as a human being. She is worth teaching that she is a human being, and when anybody says, "You can't do that" or "You shouldn't do that	0
I had to go through the pain of making this recipe in the last week of December and it's just the right amount of time to appreciate the beauty and the deliciousness of cinnamon rolls! It's so easy and quick, I recommend it for anyone who does not like baked goods! It's very versatile for cinnamon rolls, like banana bread and French toast, which is awesome for lazy Sunday mornings. If you do like these, you can make them in the morning and wait a while – I waited almost the whole morning, except for a few second for my husband to come home from work. Then a few hours later, go ahead and bring the rolls out of the oven and enjoy them! In the case of this recipe, I love a little bit of crunch here and there and if you can find fresh, shredded coconut, it's so good, it really goes perfectly with cinnamon. That's my preference so if you can afford it, you might try shredded coconut! The only thing about these rolls is: 1) they won't last as long as store-bought rolls, so if you need to bake a few dozen, store-bought, made-from-scratch rolls to go with breakfast the next day, you may as well just use the cinnamon rolls that have been sitting around, waiting for you to need them! 🙂 So without further ado, here are 3 easy steps to make these amazing cinnamon rolls: 1) Make the cinnamon rolls. First, let me explain that, I usually use my cast iron skillet for cinnamon rolls. If you don't have one of those, you can use parchment paper or foil. Simply place the dough inside and stick it in. Or place it on oiled parchment paper in the skillet and turn it over. Do it on the stove top, on the hob, on the grill or on the grill pan. If you do use a skillet, you can even use a hot pan. If you use parchment paper, the cinnamon rolls will be a bit drier. But seriously, you can use any pan you like. I usually don't use any parchment here because it's not as good as parchment, but you can use it if you want! 🙂 2) Roll the cinnamon rolls with the sauce. Then simply stick everything together with a fork. I prefer a slightly moist cinnamon roll because the consistency of the cinnamon doesn't sink in easily. If you prefer your cinnamon rolls to be dry, you can bake them for a few more minutes. Or cover the pan with a few inches of water and bake for 15-20 minutes, stirring once during 10-15 minutes and after it comes out of the oven. 3) Take them out of the pan and flip them. Now let me know if there are any steps where I do not describe the method perfectly. It's always good to ask for help so please do ask. So let's get started! Step #1 Dissolve the sugar, water, eggs and vanilla in the bowl of an electric mixer. Once the mixture is all mixed together, add the coconut oil and mix for two minutes. Then you can slowly add the flour to the dough – add it all in, one tablespoon at a time. Once you've added all the flour, it's time to knead. Then you need to knead for about 8-10 minutes until the dough just starts to get smooth. When you've finished, place the dough on a lightly floured surface. Then you can roll it out into a rectangle and cut it into 24 pieces (you should roll them out into 8-10 pieces). The coconut oil will take a little bit of work to roll out. If you want to do some work-free cinnamon rolls, use your hands. Just put it on a baking sheet – the coconut oil is soft and the butter will make it easier to roll out. This is my favorite kind of cinnamon rolls. 🙂 Step #2 Take one of the dough pieces and roll it up into two big circles. This is where the magic happens. Just use your hands to make the cinnamon and butter mixture into a large ball. You can also shape it with your hands. 🙂 Place it into a parchment lined 9x13 baking dish and cover with extra parchment paper. Bake the cinnamon rolls for 25 minutes, or until the cinnamon rolls are nicely golden-browned. Step #3 If you are adding some sweetener or additional sugar and eggs, sprinkle it on the top of the cinnamon rolls before baking at 350° F, for about 5-7 minutes until the sugar is fully absorbed (check the temperature of your baking dish during this step). Serve directly from the oven and keep warm, or serve warm and refrigerated for 5-7 minutes. If you are making them for a party, place them back in the sauce just like store-bought cinnamon	0
A B.C. police commander says a group of men he arrested last week in a Vancouver housing project had broken into the complex, then held a party inside while police were en route. The men, many without tickets or criminal record, had been kicked out of a West End unit for causing "disturbances," though police have not yet charged them with a crime. The break-in happened sometime between 6 a.m. and 9 a.m., and four officers were dispatched. The officers spotted three other men nearby who were also allegedly stealing from the complex. "We responded to the front door where two people were kicking open a door ... and we confronted them and it turned out that they were with one of the suspects that had actually been kicked out of that complex earlier in the morning," said Sgt. Paul Estrin. At that point, one suspect allegedly turned violent, beating an officer and a second officer. Two of the accused then left without resistance, but a third suspect stayed behind and started to assault an officer, Estrin said. When he tried to restrain him, Estrin said, the suspect threw an object that hit his head and broke his glasses. "We used a Taser in a way that we typically do because as we got close a suspect tried to resist and at that point he went into shock mode, he stopped moving, so we had no choice but to tase him. He was obviously unconscious at this point due to a Taser and then when we removed the Taser, we saw bruising on his face." The officers then arrested six men, including the man who was tasered, and placed them in custody. There also appeared to be two more suspects, Estrin said, because at one point the police vehicle transporting the officers had to make an emergency stop on Highway 1 to avoid hitting a stalled car that was blocking the highway. When Estrin arrived at a police station to confirm the eight-man squad had been successfully apprehended, he noticed some people in a small building nearby had been partying. The officers had to evacuate the building because they knew the building was full of people, and took the first seven people in the building for questioning. The other eight escaped, and Estrin believes that was probably the reason there was a party with only seven people within a small building. After taking the seven for questioning, the officers went to their car to search for weapons. One of the men inside had a bat that he'd been using as a weapon, a knife and a set of keys. Estrin said he does not know if the knife was legal to carry. The bat was too large to get into a police car without injuring the officer, Estrin said. He does not know how the three people in the building were able to avoid being handcuffed, and is unsure if the bat was legal to carry. He believes a person needs to be able to get the bat inside a police car with them without it hurting them. With files from Meghan Hurley and Meghan Gillies kderosa@timescolonist.com	0
"You'll know you're a survivor when you see a white person's name on a police database," he wrote. "I am proud to say that my father wasn't included." A spokeswoman said the company has not yet made a decision on whether it will pursue the lawsuit. At the moment, the company has "no comment" about Mr. White's story but said in a statement to The Times that it investigates allegations of police misconduct with "fierce rigor." The company, which also owns a major trucking company, said "we welcome legitimate and credible civil rights litigation." As recently as Thursday, Mayor Bill de Blasio, a liberal, promised to make it easier to sue police, saying he would require an independent civil rights monitor for every department, and make it easier for people to access records of police shootings and discipline by the Police Department. Mr. White's own lawyer, Anthony R. Matteucci, told The Daily News that Mr. White had been the subject of dozens of racist online comments over the years over the incident, and that he was seeking damages for psychological and emotional distress. "He's still a child, and he has never forgotten," he said. "He's been living like this for a decade and a half. He's not going to be satisfied until he got justice."	0
A new report of India's first ever 'Bathroom Bill' in the Indian Parliament has raised questions about the impact of such a bill on women. Women's Rights advocate Vrinda Grover told International Business Times India that "This bill should not be passed." The bill was originally filed in September 2016 in the Indian Parliament. It requires anyone using restrooms/showers, including people visiting the toilet, to have a separate ticket. A statement released by India's Ministry of Women and Child Development (WCD), the law's sponsor, says the policy will eliminate discrimination and provide a "privacy-friendly environment." "A person may use the communal bath while using the restroom to keep their dignity and will not be molested," the statement says. "In case a person uses the communal facility as per the directions, others may not disturb him/her in the toilet. This has been designed to serve to make such facilities inclusive for everyone." Grover wrote to President of the National Commission for Women, Lalitha Kumaramangalam, about the bill. She's written to President Pranab Mukherjee and Prime Minister Narendra Modi about the issue saying that she "will be filing a complaint in court." "This bill is unconstitutional because it is discriminatory and targets women," Grover told IBTimes India. "There are many people who do use the facilities, but no one can tell them to use the bathroom only for females." Grover said that if the bill is passed, she plans to ask for a judicial review. If she can't, Grover said she would like to see the whole issue "thrown out," since she believes it's unconstitutional. Grover noted that the bill is also a first of its kind in the world. The issue of bathroom bills like these has been on the agenda in other parts of the world. In the U.S., in 2014, the city of Seattle adopted a "Right To Bathroom" ordinance. It requires businesses and landlords to provide a separate space for each person's personal use. Grover also pointed out that the U.S. is a diverse country and "discrimination should not be allowed against one, race, gender, or religion in the U.S." The bill in India is not a direct response to North Carolina's recently passed "Bathroom Bill" that requires transgender people to use the bathroom of their birth gender. India is not a North Carolina. But, it does seem to be a "bathroom" bill that targets women. Read more: India To Introduce A New Policy That Allows Adults To Go To The Bathroom As They Choose Grover also stressed that this kind of legislation should be about children. "It's about protecting children, and it's about protecting women," Grover said. "It is very difficult for a woman to go to the toilet alone." Grover also pointed out that the U.S. is no stranger to bathrooms and is a relatively progressive nation when it comes to allowing women to be treated as they see fit. "Why are we allowing governments to impose these requirements on individuals by their own consent?" Grover asked IBTimes India. Grover also pointed out that this kind of regulation shouldn't apply to foreigners as the legislation shouldn't apply to anyone who needs a bathroom on the road to public transportation. Grover is no stranger when it comes to fighting for women's rights. She made headlines in the past for suing the family planning and HIV Prevention Minister Maneka Gandhi after she allegedly sexually harassed her. Grover won the suit in 2008 and was awarded an equal amount in the amount of damages. There's no doubt that it didn't deter Gandhi from using her powers to harass the woman again. Gandhi has also been criticized for a new bill in the Indian Parliament that will allow men to rape their female partners and make it illegal to raise a son to be free of that sort of violence. Grover said "The women's movement is making real progress, and the government should also support these things by bringing them up to the level of law." "Women are no longer treated as an inferior species by their governments," Grover argued. "This shows an enormous transformation in India." Photo courtesy of Shutterstock	0
In the midst of an increasingly bitter political battle, the mayor of a southern Ontario town is asking for federal funding to ensure the survival of a local school. But in Regina, an MP wants to ban city staff from using federally-funded programs in schools, as a way of preventing federal agents from snooping in their files and learning the identities of those who work there. In the past few weeks, Toronto Mayor Rob Ford – the son of the late former mayoral chief of staff, David Soknacki – has publicly railed against Ottawa for making it harder for Canadian cities to borrow to build more public infrastructure. Story continues below advertisement He accused Ottawa of trying to prevent him from using tax dollars to help refurbish his home in Etobicoke. He was especially incensed after the Ontario government recently added an eight per cent tax surcharge to the federal-provincial infrastructure bank loan that his office can use to build a library and green space, as well as other municipal projects. In the meantime, Mr. Ford asked for a $1-million federal grant to expand the school at a time when city staff can't afford the added cost of renting office space downtown. "I'm asking for $1-million from the federal government," Mr. Ford, who is not running for re-election, told a crowd of more than 100 people at a school that has closed for good. He said the grant would provide money for a new library, and also support the town's new community centre. "I know I can't ask for that, but this is about the children in this area," he said. The grant would go to help the new School of the Art + Design, to be built by Regina architect Michael Kinsley. Mr. Kinsley is the designer of the new Regina-Wascana library, unveiled by Prime Minister Stephen Harper last week. Council's executive order will also put the matter on council's agenda in July for further discussion, council president Kerry Jang said. "We want to keep it as a special concern because it will be a very unique thing to have at one of our main schools," he said. Saskatchewan Premier Brad Wall, a provincial MP who represents the party that elected Mr. Ford to council, said he had heard from a number of people who feel angry the federal government has made it impossible for the city to borrow for construction projects. The province's finance minister, Kevin Doherty, has told The Globe and Mail that cities can use their provincial infrastructure bank to borrow money to fund major projects, including major infrastructure projects. But they are forbidden to use the bank for other purposes. Story continues below advertisement Story continues below advertisement In Regina, Mr. Doherty said provincial borrowing can take place as part of the province's infrastructure bank. Mr. Doherty said the city borrowed $3.8-billion (U.S.) to build the $400-million Regina Central Library. The capital cost included a five-year, 2.1-per-cent property-tax hike. The province is lending the total of $4.9-billion for 10 years. "The capital cost for the Regina Central Library, which is part of what we call a transit-based city, is very similar … [with] what we would call capital cost for a library in Toronto or Quebec City, two other major Canadian cities that have very strong public library-based systems." Quebec borrowed more from the province's infrastructure bank because of a greater need for capital projects and because Quebec's tax rates are generally lower than in Ontario, Mr. Doherty said. The federal government provides funds to help cities build infrastructure, but only if the city is eligible and eligible cities are paid for their share through charges to residents, said a federal finance department source. The amount of any charge might be smaller than for a public hospital. The loan would not replace the cost of the land lease, such as a $250-million provincial subsidy to the town for buying the land and building the school. "It's not a loan," a source said. Story continues below advertisement Mr. Jang said the council does not want to ban staff from using federally funded programs in schools, as is being proposed by federal MP Brad Butt, who is running to be party leader in the Saskatchewan Party. The MP has drafted a bill that would make Toronto Mayor Rob Ford's request to borrow from Ottawa a federal offence, something he called "extreme." Mr. Butt said he believes that the government has put too much restrictions on how cities are used to fund municipal projects and public-works projects. "All of this really does is take away the option for municipalities to access the resources," he said in an interview. Saskatchewan has long been a champion of school closures in cities around the province. Since 1996, the province has	0
The FBI's raid on a San Bernardino, California law firm that represents several Apple executives has been characterized as the agency's most aggressive action yet to crack down on Silicon Valley. The FBI has sought to force Apple to help it bypass an iPhone running iOS 8, Apple's new operating system for iPhones, as it develops a case against a terrorist in Yemen linked to Al-Qaeda. A federal judge rejected the agency's demand for software to allow the government to hack into locked iPhones. Apple's lawyers said the government's actions were "an egregious breach of the legal process" and that they hoped court documents could be sealed, according to the Associated Press. A spokeswoman for the San Bernardino County district attorney didn't respond to a request for comment. The agency's move has set off a firestorm on both sides of the debate. Apple (AAPL) and the FBI have been at loggerheads on how the government should proceed with its case. Apple and the FBI have accused each other of playing politics. On Friday, the Justice Department made public a letter that it sent to the FBI's leading federal judge earlier that day. The letter, a copy of which was posted on the website of U.S. District Judge Sheri Pym, told Pym that the U.S. government is considering filing criminal charges against the people behind the hacking tool, known as the "kill switch," and the person who made it open to the public.	0

Gareth Bale has scored 19 goals for club and country this season Olympic Games semi-final first leg v Ukraine Venue: Maracana Stadium Date: Monday 22 September Kick-off: 19:45 BST Coverage: Live on BBC Radio 5 live, plus live text commentary on BBC Sport website Arsenal striker and Welshman Gareth Bale has been confirmed as the third Wales player to feature in the Euro 2016 final, as they face the winners of Belgium and France. Wales qualified as one of three teams not to have picked an outfield player in their final 10-man squad, with fellow former players Aaron Ramsey and James Chester, whose omission was in the original 23 on Tuesday, being named to replace them. Defender Chester is currently sidelined with an injury. Bale, who will be making his 100th international appearance, came off the bench to score the winner in Barcelona on Tuesday. "Gareth has proven himself against top opposition and with the Premier League's top teams. He is one of the most reliable and important players for us," said Wales boss Chris Coleman at his news conference. "The next 11 games, at the very least, are very important to show we have the quality to go to the semi-finals." Media playback is not supported on this device Euro 2016 final: Gareth Bale scores stunning winner for Wales over Spain But it is Chester who may have been most disappointed to miss out, given his record. He made his first Wales appearance in August 2005, making his full international debut against Australia in Cardiff before his first international start at the age of 17 against Moldova in Moscow. Two more appearances followed in November that year before Chester had an opportunity to play the full 90 minutes in Wales' first three European games.

But an injury problem forced him to miss Euro 2012, while injury problems have blighted his Euro 2016 campaign to date. In his most recent game, on 8 November, he joined fellow Welshman Aaron Ramsey on the treatment table after he was injured running to win possession in the box under pressure from Spanish midfielder Sergio Busquets, with the resulting collision sending him crashing against a wall on the edge of the penalty area. Coleman felt Ramsey's injury looked "dizzier than it actually was"; it has since been confirmed the Arsenal man suffered ligament damage against Benfica. "I am not the one in control of our first team," said Coleman, who has only kept one of his 10 changes to the side beaten by Spain during his first two games in charge.	0
1. What is a 'Coroner's Inquest' The coroners inquest is a public inquiry into the death of a person. By law, its main purpose is to help determine the cause of death, and the steps taken by the medical or other professionals involved. The inquest is similar to an open-council coroner, that is, the inquiry has all the powers of an open-council inquest with certain conditions. The coroner's inquest can be a one-day public hearing, and it can cover all the facts relevant to the cause of death, without restricting the investigation. It provides the public with an opportunity to make submissions to the coroner and hear all of the witnesses at the inquest. The inquest has only a limited ability to intervene and, if required, take any steps to determine the cause of death. It is therefore often the case that a coroners inquest is the final process of investigation. The coroner does not look for criminal or accidental criminal or legal action in an inquiry, however he or she can request an inquest if he or she needs to pursue evidence from other public bodies about possible criminal or legal action. 2. Is There a National Coroners' Inquest? There is a statutory requirement for coroners to hold coroners' inquests for each person who dies in the UK. The coroners inspect the scene and interview the primary person and anyone else who can provide any information about the fatal incident. Further, the coroner has the power to call other people for a coroners' inquest to assess the circumstances of an accident involving one of the deceased. There are certain circumstances in which the coroner can be called to consider whether the deaths were caused by criminal or legal action. This is known as a criminal inquest. 3. An Overview of Coroners' Inquest's Why Do Coroners Hold Coroners' Inquiries Why do coroners need to hold coroners' inquests? This is not a straightforward question to answer, however there are a few common reasons why coroners need to hold coroners' inquests. This section explains what coroners' inquests are and provides an overview for those who may be unfamiliar. The purpose of the coroners' inquest is to help settle or clarify matters with respect to the death of a person. This is to allow for the proper determination of compensation of the deceased and to provide reassurance to relatives of the dead and relatives of the injured. The hearing of the coroners inquest helps the family of the death to understand and work with the healthcare authorities, the police, the coroner and the Department of Justice – to name a few agencies. This helps alleviate problems that were not fully understood earlier on. Further information on the inquest process may be found by using the links contained on each section. How Coroners Run Coroners' Inquiries The coroners have the power to set the terms of the coroners' inquest and usually do so whenever possible. Generally, coroners set the terms of the inquest, and it is the coroner who chooses the order in which the inquiries will be held and who can choose what issues or questions to ask. The inquest may take place concurrently with a regular inquest or at a later date. Where an inquest is needed to clarify medical conditions, which is most often the case, as most medical and legal conditions for the death of a person are unclear or undetermined, the inquest must be held within 14 days following the death or any death, whichever is the earlier date. An inquest may also be set over many different issues, however this rarely occurs. Coroners decide the terms of the inquest themselves and not over the objections of any other investigating authority. While it's likely that each coroners' inquest will cover many different issues, there are three important issues in the public and legal mind which cause people to express serious concern about how an inquest is conducted: the length of the inquest, the nature of medical tests in which the coroner participates and whether or not evidence is kept secret. Who Conducts Coroners' Inquests Corinars are often run by coroners, such as the Coroner, Family Coroner and the Chief Coroner. The chief coroners also tend to oversee the wider coronation arrangements. There are three main types of coroners who run coroners inquests: Family Coroner family coroners – in the UK, the Coroners' Service is a statutory public service and its members can be identified using the following code names: Coroner, Family Coroner. These coroner's coroners are appointed to a specific geographical area and are responsible for holding coroners inquests and, sometimes, other types of inquests in other parts of the UK. They are the most powerful person in the county they are appointed to. They can also run the coroner's inquests if they are deemed appropriate by the Cabinet Secretary- a public office holder.

When did the public in America (and the wider world) start believing that all children are entitled to the same entitlements and privileges as the elite? Or that it is reasonable to expect adults and children of all races, gender, and income level to be "equal"? A new Pew study shows how young children in American schools are increasingly being indoctrinated with this attitude. "Among the public, the number stating that children should not be held back because of race, class, or economic status has grown from 46% to 53% in the last four decades." "More than 6-in-10 adults (63%) also say that it is a good thing for all children if their parents can support them and if adults in the household can provide for them; just a third (33%) say it is a bad thing if the same is true for their own children." It is interesting to note that there is no similar growth in the number of people that feel that all children should be held back because of their race, class, or income.	0
This article was written by David Scharf, Executive director of the Institute for Science and International Security and an adjunct senior scholar of the Global Policy Institute and contributor to the Center for American Progress. The United States has a strong record in reducing nuclear and missile threats. But the same is true of no other country with as large a nuclear arsenal. At present more than 800 nuclear weapons in total (roughly equivalent to 60,000 warheads for the American arsenal, one-fifth to one-seventeenth that of the Soviet Union) are being deployed in more than 25 countries. In addition, the United States has an arsenal of some 100 intercontinental missiles (ICBMs) capable of carrying nuclear warheads that could be launched from more than 10,000 sites, all of which would have to remain operational through the end of the decade. In 2011, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimated that total expenses necessary to maintain the nuclear modernization program—including routine maintenance and refurbishment—in the United States over the coming decade would exceed $3 trillion. If those expenditures are divided evenly among 30 countries with the largest nuclear arsenals—including Brazil, China, India, Pakistan, South Korea, and Russia—that means that these countries would collectively spend about $1,600 per year per nuclear weapon, including the cost of construction and decommissioning. The sheer number of nuclear-armed states, the range of their arsenals, and the size of their budgets—some of them the size of countries such as Russia—create a serious problem for those countries that cannot or will not comply with the new treaty. In effect, a potential nuclear war between these countries would inevitably be fought over scarce stockpiles of nuclear weapons. Yet even with this enormous military effort, we can still expect that if there is a conventional military conflict between nuclear-armed states, there may well be a nuclear exchange. In any case, the risk of a nuclear exchange is high given our political, military, and media institutions are not prepared to deal with an accident or breakdown in the system. We have already seen how the fear of nuclear war has resulted, in some places, in the abrogation of treaties and agreements. We cannot expect to find similar international agreements that can stop the next nuclear exchange. A potential nuclear war between nuclear-armed states could escalate quickly and dramatically if it were not for a number of factors. The first is the nature of the nuclear arsenals of the nuclear-armed states. As it has done with nuclear weapons, the United States is working to deescalate conflict and reduce the likelihood of large-scale conventional retaliation. In this effort, each country is focusing on a handful of nuclear weapons—an effort known as "ballistic alignment." (See this map for a rough estimate of the numbers.) Because most people would not immediately understand what nuclear weapons are, it is useful to explain them briefly. The nuclear weapons in today's arsenals are: Three hydrogen bombs: the bombs on the B-61 ("strategic hydrogen bomb"), the B-83 ("stealth and precision hydrogen bomb"), and the H-bomb to be used on Russian soil in 2015 ("high yield thermonuclear weapon"). They all can explode with up to 300 megatons of explosive force. One thermonuclear missile carried by a carrier aircraft (a "strategic missile"). One nuclear-tipped cruise missile. An estimated one strategic submarine at the operational level. One missile-launched ballistic missile. One intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM). One land-based intercontinental ballistic missile missile (ICBM) that also carries a nuclear warhead, for use against potential adversaries in North America, the Middle East, and parts of Asia. The United States has approximately one-third of the available nuclear weapons in existence. The rest are in the hands of the United States, Russia, and countries that have nuclear arsenals as small as one (the United Kingdom). As a result of its efforts to deescalate conflict, the United States currently possesses many more strategic warheads and lower levels of warheads in the ground-launched cruise and ICBM arsenals than in 1991. As the table below indicates, in 1991, the United States held more than 7,700 warheads (the highest level ever). At present, it has roughly 3,800 warheads (the lowest level ever). If one uses the estimates by the U.S. intelligence community (in an analysis of the Soviet Union published earlier this year), it is estimated that the United States will have at least 6,700 deployed warheads by 2015. In the United States, there are major efforts underway to modernize their nuclear weapons. Many of these initiatives will require the active cooperation of major nuclear-armed states, as the Nuclear Weapons Council was not present during the debate on the START agreement, and several states on the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) have been demanding changes to the status	0
DETROIT -- Detroit Tigers infielder Nick Castellanos will have surgery Wednesday for a fractured wrist, the Tigers announced. The surgery will be performed by Dr. Stephen White at the Hospital for Special Surgery in New York. The procedure is expected to be a one-month recovery. Castellanos injured his wrist when hit in the face by a pitch Tuesday night. He walked off the field with a wrapped left wrist. He was diagnosed with a fracture in two places, and it was not known until now why he left the game late. While it appeared he suffered a contusion or bruise, a fracture requires an extra exam, so he was sent to New York for examination. The club said the procedure was necessary because the break is "not healing well." Castellanos is expected to miss at least the first month of the 2018 season after surgery. Last season, he batted .253 with 15 homers and 52 RBIs before he was traded to the Tigers while the New York Mets were making their playoff run. He was traded to the Tigers with outfielder Yoenis Cespedes for slugger Francisco Martinez two weeks later. ESPN.com's Jerry Crasnick contributed to this report.	0
PITTSBURGH (KDKA) – One of the world's largest cruise lines is bringing its fleet into Pittsburgh for a few days. Voyager Cruises has scheduled 10 ships in the Port Authority's Gateway to Pittsburgh, starting Thursday. That's a significant number of ships moving around the Port, which has the second largest commercial cruise traffic in America behind New York. "We have no doubt that as port authority, we want to be able to offer the best and best services possible," Port Authority Authority CEO David G. Reiser told KDKA-TV. Gates opened to the ships over the weekend. They're expected to leave from the cruise terminal at 11 a.m., with the last one leaving 11 p.m. Friday. RELATED LINKS: More Pittsburgh News Join The Conversation On The KDKA Facebook Page Stay Up To Date, Follow KDKA On Twitter Voyager Cruise Lines is the world's third largest cruise ship line. Its ships operate out of seven ports in the U.S. and Bermuda. The ships will visit nine ports in Pittsburgh, including the Port Authority terminals and a new cruise terminal built at the port. "We are looking forward to exploring its capabilities, its amenities and its people as we get ready for the arrival of our next ship early next year, and we very much welcome the opportunity to do so here," Reiser said. The Port Authority spent more than $5 million buying an additional three terminals to accommodate the incoming cruise ships.

The US government can be a tough court for journalists. After all, the government doesn't always get it right. But it has gotten the government wrong in a case that has to sting: In July, the AP published "leaked" memos describing two secret programs, codenamed Stellar Wind and Trailblazer, that collected and stored the telephone metadata of almost every US citizen. Those programs, authorized under the PATRIOT Act, are the basis for a lawsuit filed in 2010 by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU). It now appears, at least on the surface, to have been a classic legal flub. "It would be unfair, frankly, to characterize our complaint as some sort of government wrongdoing," the ACLU's director of media relations, Nathan Freed Wessler, said the other day. He told me he thought his organization "fought harder and did far more than our adversaries are going to get away with," and that he was not "convinced" that "all of what happened in the courtroom was a victory for the government." The AP had published the documents after seeking and receiving permission from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence to view the documents — which it did from inside the federal courthouse, outside a classified portion of the courthouse. Although "leaking" a grand jury document is a federal crime, the law does not seem to have been violated here (the government had to ask for the documents). The ACLU's complaint alleges, as a matter of law, that the documents published violated the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, and that they were provided to the AP on condition of anonymity. The government has not refuted those specific allegations. There is some dispute about whether they were classified. The government, in its response to the ACLU, says the documents were "not top secret" and not "authorized for release." But the ACLU insists that they are "classified/secrets" under both the Privacy Act and the Patriot Act, according to two of the officials I interviewed. (The document in question can be found at the bottom of page 14 of the PDF of the government's response.) Regardless of whether they were classified, the memos described programs that the government had not disclosed during the Bush administration, after having announced the programs in 2008. That fact matters, according to the ACLU. Although those agencies may have been operating under the auspices of the PATRIOT Act, it is the FISA Act that allowed the programs to go forward, in part because of legal changes approved by Congress after 9/11 that expanded the definition of the term "authorized by law to conduct electronic surveillance or physical searches" to include "electronic surveillance and physical searches of foreign powers or agents of foreign powers," which it did not include prior to 2008. So while the administration was legally permitted to secretly claim the authority to collect the metadata of millions of Americans, they had not disclosed that.	0

The government of India is considering a bill that would make the country's internet a 'state-controlled monopoly.' "We are also planning to take a series of steps to ensure that the net does not operate beyond the control of government and is run for the benefits of the people," Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Internet and Mobile Association president R. Ashish Chauhan told the BBC. He added that the bill is still being drafted; the details would be made available soon. India's proposal comes as concerns about the country's government's efforts to protect India's Internet infrastructure have grown in recent weeks. The country's telecom and media officials have already rejected proposals by several leading technology companies such as Facebook, Google, and Facebook rival Twitter – which wants to build an Indian equivalent of the Internet. That proposal was rejected by India's Information Technology ministry, which argued that it would compromise India's digital sovereignty. Related: Microsoft To Pay Nearly $170 Million To End Indian Data-Protection Law Suit India is reportedly one of eight countries with plans – in addition to the United States, Japan, and parts of Canada and Europe – to pass bills that would force companies to host their infrastructure within their own borders. A bill recently proposed in the German parliament would force companies to pay for their own network infrastructure. Chauhan also noted that it was "not possible to discuss this issue any further publicly."	0

The U.S.-led coalition has recently attacked in support of the Syrian government of President Bashar al-Assad. But on September 19, Reuters reported that "the Pentagon is preparing to provide its own weapons to opposition forces and train them on their use of air defense weapons, a senior Defense Department official said on Monday." The official was unable to say whether the U.S. would supply such weapons to "moderate opposition" forces — that is, groups that do not engage in violence. While the coalition has been reluctant to supply arms, it is not averse to providing training in the U.S.-funded program "The Green Berets," which will "enable Syrian rebel troops to protect themselves with anti-aircraft missiles to protect their positions." This is important because both the U.S.-led coalition and the Assad regime are now involved in combat. In this context, the recent announcement that Washington "is preparing to provide its own weapons to moderate opposition forces" is significant. For the Syrian government, the U.S. arms could be crucial if it were to continue its military campaign against the Islamic State. The Islamic State is believed to have a network of thousands of foreign fighters that it is using to launch terrorist attacks both in Syria and in Iraq. For these fighters, the presence of the Assad regime would not provide much comfort. But the Assad regime's continued existence would provide a degree of military cover that, if broken, would leave the Islamic State to carry on its attacks. While the Islamic State has not taken much territory in the past four months, it is still able to conduct large-scale terrorist attacks both in Syria and Iraq. In this context, the recent announcement that Washington "is preparing to provide its own weapons to moderate opposition forces" is significant. Not only would the weapons provide protection to the Islamic State, they would also provide cover to those fighting the Islamic State as well. Moreover, the Obama administration is likely to decide that the Islamic State does not pose a serious threat to the U.S. from the air. Yet, if the Assad regime falls, as the most likely outcome, then the "moderate" opposition in Syria would very likely fall as well. This would leave only U.S.-supported or -trained Sunni Syrian rebels as the regime's only military and fighting force. As the Syrian army will quickly be turned over to U.S.-backed proxies, the rebels would soon be outnumbered by those who have turned against them and turned to terrorism in the hopes of creating a more stable world. The Islamic State's success against the "moderates" will give that group access to weapons it lacks now. The Obama administration needs to know this if it is to be able to continue aiding the Syrian rebels. As President Obama has said, Washington will be assisting the moderate opposition "for as long as it takes," but "we want to do it with partners that are going to be successful." The Syria crisis is entering a critical stage following the Islamic State's seizure of large swaths of territory in Iraq and Syria and its recent attacks on Paris and Brussels. While most of these attacks have targeted the Shi'ite minority in both countries, al-Qaeda, which grew from the Islamic State's strongholds in Iraq, has already shown that it will attack non-Sunni groups, both Shi'ite and Sunni. While the U.S. and its allies continue bombing the Islamic State, it is imperative that they do so with caution.	0

The new year is here (it's time to be grateful and joyful, you know)! So how can we start a new year off right? By making our annual resolutions and, of course, by trying to reach our goal of losing at least a pound of fat a week. That's right, it's time to get serious. You have the power over your life. And every day, you can choose to get the things that you want. The truth is that most of the things that make you feel like failures in life or worse, unattractive, are simply habits. Habits that you can change, at any time. That's how I got motivated to lose weight. When I realized that I was unable to change what I liked and disliked about my body, I decided in 2010 to try something radical: To take my body out of the equation completely. What I mean by radical is that I was going to eat as I like, regardless of what other people were eating. I wanted to live by my own rules, and let the rest of the world eat whatever they liked. That's what I called a No-Calorie Diet (NCD) and it turned out to be a game changer for my health. I lost an amazing 10 pounds in a very short period of time. This was the result of my focus on taking good care of myself and taking action. I was very skeptical about how it would impact my life, but I kept it up for two whole months, doing nothing but eating normally. And I saw incredible results: I became happier, I went from being a 35-inch waist to a more acceptable 35-16.3. The only side effect that I noticed was that I felt really good about myself, which is just as important as losing weight. Now, I realize that my experience isn't representative of everyone: some people need food to live. Some people like junk food. And some people don't even eat for pleasure. There's no harm in any of it, as long as you're making conscious decisions to be healthy. But I want to inspire people to be a different kind of human — to be motivated by their health even if it sounds crazy. Maybe you're an extremely successful person, where you're able to eat what you want without losing any weight. Or you can be a sloth, who doesn't care about food at all. Whatever the case, you can be the person you want to be by getting into the habit of taking healthy actions. Here's how: Choose not to worry: One of the hardest things to do as an unhealthy person is to realize that we can't control everything that happens to us. If we focus on how much weight we gained or lost, we will never be motivated to change that. In the past, I've worked with people who suffered from binge eating disorder — and, quite honestly, those people are the ones who get motivated to lose weight since they realize that they won't have "their thing" if they keep being fat. But it also helps to be less worried about how much weight we want, or what others eat. Let your body go in whatever direction it wants to go: We often try to make ourselves accountable for things like weight, but let your body take the lead. It's your body and that's what it wants. Some people prefer exercise for health, others for their mental health. Do whatever works for you, and let your body do those things. You don't control how much exercise or weight you put on, so please do only that which you're comfortable with and you won't regret. Focus on the good: While not eating is great, the most important thing that's going on in your life — or your body's — is that you're healthy. Even if the bad stuff was going on with the food you choose to eat, all you can control is your health. And the good stuff? Well, all you can control is how you think. The next time you find yourself looking at a beautiful picture or something great you've done, remind yourself that it was because of all your good decisions. Let that be your motivation to take better care of yourself. Have fun and be positive: Life is going to be challenging and even frustrating. But it won't be anything you can't handle — it's going to be beautiful and fun and rewarding. Don't worry, though. And the best way to have fun in life is to focus on enjoying yourself. So make an effort to enjoy everything, and don't worry about the negative things. Life is a marathon, not a sprint. If you keep your mind on the positive and don't let negative thoughts make you nervous, you can overcome any situation. Remember that you can still do it: I have been saying for years that you can't beat your body in the game of life, but I have also always believed that you can	0
The idea for this video came from watching my daughters walk around the house. The idea was this is the way to teach your kids that the world is real and that everything that they see that is not real is only a mirage, and just a movie, or a dream. A lot of times I am surprised by what kids see around them and it really shocks me. I think it's just the children's way of understanding the world. My daughter would walk around the house telling me that the house was haunted. She wouldn't know how to explain to me how she'd seen something that isn't there, but I didn't know how to explain to her what she saw. That's how I learned that these things are only dreams, and only the imagination of the kids. I think that's a lesson that should be learned for all of us. Children have a heightened understanding of the world; that is why they need to be taught this lesson early. Do you think this is a good video to show your kids?? Comments comments	0
An international team led by scientists at Queen Mary University of London has studied evidence of an unusual, rapid rise in sea level over the last 3,500 years. This rapid response has been traced to a sudden weakening of the eastern North Atlantic ridge, which was originally built to help prevent sea levels from rising. This event may have triggered rapid volcanic eruptions in Iceland at about the same time. Over the last 2,000 years, the north Atlantic ridge has continued to weaken, but it did so too slowly to allow sea levels to begin a long period of decrease, which is what was thought to have happened in the 20th Century. The team, which is reporting its findings today at the Royal Society, used the volcanic record from Iceland and the Antarctic ice sheet to trace a single event, that of an abrupt loss of strength in the ridge, occurring in 1275 AD, and to investigate the consequences in time. The scientists were also able to reconstruct a more complex sequence of events that took place in the middle of the last glacial maximum, which lasted until about 20,000 years ago. The results have important implications for understanding the dynamics of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans during the Last Glacial Maximum. It could also help to explain an unprecedented sea level drop in the last century. The researchers used detailed modelling techniques to trace one small phase of the event, which may have started immediately before 1275. They then considered the effects that the eruption of Mount St Helens had on the Atlantic. They concluded that it likely contributed to a drop in sea levels by causing an increasing tilt in the crust. This caused the ridge to buckle, and the ridge has continued to weaken ever since. "The rapid strengthening of the ridge was triggered because it broke down suddenly," explains Dr David Naylor-Clarke, the project leader from the Geographer's department at QMUL. "For that to happen we're going to need to think about some very dramatic eruptions in Iceland during this period. "We've never seen any volcanic eruption at Iceland from this time period, so it's interesting to look at this period when it's so different." Scientists have been able to follow the development of the Atlantic ridge since the end of the last glacial maximum about 12,000 years ago. In that time it has weakened a small amount but gradually declined in strength. The study revealed that the ridge weakened within minutes, even though the rate at which this is happening has fluctuated over the last 10,000 years. The team suggest that this sudden weakening may also have been associated with a volcanic eruption that took place at about the same time. Dr Naylor-Clarke's group has now used the same modelling tools to analyse several other episodes of rapid sea level rise over the last 3,500 years. ### "Global patterns in sea level rise of the last 3,500 years," by Naylor-Clarke (QMUL) and others is available as an open access article ahead of print on Geobiology.	0

Photo: AP A police officer stands guard at the Eiffel Tower. Photo: AP PARIS — Two of four hostages shot dead in Paris on Friday are among five people killed in the capital on Friday evening. Two men who were shot dead inside a car in a Parisian suburb died of their injuries, a judicial source said. Another person was shot in the leg. The man shot in Montrouge is dead. The judicial source told Associated Press that the fourth victim, a 35-year-old woman, wasn't a hostage. She was at a bar on the Avenue Montparnasse before she was shot and died. The source said two victims were among five people killed in northern Paris -- a 34-year-old man and his pregnant girlfriend. In another incident, a man died after his car exploded near Boulevard Voltaire in northern Paris just before 8 p.m. (11 a.m. ET), according to the Paris prosecutor general's office. It wasn't clear if the man was a pedestrian or a driver of the car who was using the vehicle as a getaway vehicle. The explosion occurred near the corner of the street where four other people were killed in the city on Friday evening, said Paris Prosecutor Francois Molins. An official at the prosecutor's office in Paris said early Saturday that authorities were looking into whether the explosion was terrorist or arson. According to the French Interior Ministry, the first explosion occurred on the Rue de Rivoli where a woman was fatally shot and injured. A passerby then detonated an explosive device on a car in front of the building, injuring another. The official also said that the car used in the explosions was a white Fiat Panda hatchback that had been hijacked in Strasbourg, France, early Saturday. Police took two people into custody when they arrived at the scene in the city of about 40,000 located southeast of Paris. Police closed the streets in the area around the Paris prosecutor's office and the Eiffel Tower, where President François Hollande was attending a concert featuring U2. Police officials say the bombings were not related to the attacks on Friday. One person was killed in a suicide attack outside the French Embassy in the city of Nice, France, on Friday, the French Interior Ministry said in a statement late Saturday. The attacker detonated an explosive device near the main entrance of the building, the ministry said. Three explosions were also heard Friday night at the Stade de France in Paris, one at the end of a soccer match and another shortly before it ended, according to the French Interior Ministry. Two people were killed and dozens were wounded in three blasts in Paris. The explosions caused no lasting structural damage and the explosions were not linked to attacks on Friday against the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo, the national soccer team of France or the U.S. Consulate. In other attacks, three explosions were blamed on a man trying to steal a soldier's uniform in the eastern Paris suburb of Dammartin-en-Goele on Friday night. No one was wounded. Two people were seriously injured in the attack, said Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve. France had been on high alert since Wednesday when two Islamist gunmen killed 20 people on the Champs-Elysees in what was the deadliest attack against French tourists since November 2015. The terrorists shouted "Allahu akbar" during the hostage takings. The manhunt for the two perpetrators led police to an industrial area of northern Paris from where the assault was planned. France is under a state of emergency after the attacks, which the state of emergency was extended a third time earlier. On Sunday, a security manhunt is ongoing for suspected terrorists who have attacked in Paris. Police carried out several raids across Paris, according to the French Interior Ministry. Prime Minister Manuel Valls warned that there was "no limit to what could happen in France" and warned of the "grave" impact on families and for tourism.	0
The man was also arrested on a warrant accusing him of burglary and assault with intent to commit robbery, police said. A 29-year-old man charged with burglarizing a home near the White Horse Reservoir is being held at the Clark County Detention Center after police say he broke into the home to get his dog, and his girlfriend was in the house at the time. The man was already in jail under an unrelated bail-beating case. He was charged with burglary and assault with intent to commit robbery after he was pulled over in the early morning hours Aug. 11 for driving with a suspended license. The Clark County Detention Center records also show that the man, who is homeless, was arrested five times over four years on warrants for violating his probation. In March 2011, he was charged with unlawful possession of marijuana after cops said he used marijuana during his probation. He also had four charges of violating his probation between 2002 and early 2010, including charges of resisting an officer by flight, failing to obey a lawful order by a peace officer, obstructing an officer and possessing drug paraphernalia. Then in late 2011, he was charged with interfering with a school employee. The charges stem from an incident in which he was allegedly found drunk inside his pickup truck in a school parking lot. He was later found guilty of those charges. Police now aren't sure why the man did it, but they say he is known to have threatened to kill himself. The suspect is in jail without bail and will be held until he is extradited to San Diego.	0
What a great year this has been for the city of Columbus, that we may get to make a run back to the MLS Cup Final, it can at least start here. This year, in our own backyard, we were able to watch a young boy born into the best soccer community in the world have one of his greatest days ever by scoring one of the greatest goals of his life. It took an incredible player who knew exactly what was going to happen before he took aim. It's like nothing else I have seen in terms of emotion. A goal is scored and the crowd screams and hollers in pure joy, you realize just how rare moments like these are. As a Columbus fan, I am absolutely honored by all of this. In a few weeks, the season ends for this team, we will go on to play Montreal Impact for the USL Cup and we will hopefully get to see the club make one of the many run to the top of the Eastern Conference.

It was the most exciting first day at the job I've ever worked in. I had just been hired to work in the department of the office of a former high school student who had recently left college. He was about to begin a major in business administration. The previous guy was leaving for the night in the middle of the day, and I immediately thought, "Wow, that'll be the first of many moments I won't get to say 'Hi' to the man I'll work with for the next half an hour."

This first day of working with a new college freshman was like an exciting ride to the top of my high school dream ride — except no one saw me coming. The other first day I worked in a professional office was different. I got to say "Hi" to all the people I'd known in college. My old classmates, who I hadn't spoken to since I was in high school. My senior school social life was over. I started a job at a firm where I could finally be who I truly was, and what I'd always wanted to be: an adult.

When you're first starting out as a new employee, or an intern, the most valuable skill you can have is confidence in your abilities and how you're likely to interact. When someone asks you a question, first focus on answering their question. "I'm really eager to learn," I used to say as an opening line. I figured if someone wanted to ask about the industry that they worked in, I knew which questions they could follow and which ones I couldn't. Now, I have a simple, direct and friendly way of greeting everyone I meet. It also makes me look much more friendly, and not like a stooge. So, here are the five questions you want to ask someone: "What do you do?" "What do you like to do?" "Why do you want to work here?" "How will you help me develop more experience?" "What can I do for you?" What if they don't know? I've always felt that if you just say something that you're good at, regardless of the truth, they'll be more comfortable speaking about it. If I say I work in human resources, then they're more comfortable talking about that with me. It's like they know I'm comfortable talking about their strengths with them. Even if someone doesn't know the answer to your question and you're looking to develop that trust and connection with someone, don't be afraid to get their name, so they can let you know if you've reached out to them in the past.	0
It was a strange sight at the NFL draft Thursday for Steelers receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster : His parents were in the stands, ready to welcome his arrival. The day began at a home in Virginia for some of Smith-Schuster's close family members and several childhood friends. The family also made the drive from Pittsburgh to Indianapolis for the NFL draft. "It's really cool to be in an NFL locker room with my guys," Smith-Schuster said in a conference call to discuss his draft selection by the Steelers. "It's really cool to not know (what's ahead), just be around and hang with them. "It's going to be a great experience, a great opportunity, but just to be around all my best friends from high school, from college when I was there." Smith-Schuster's mother, Nicole, was in the front row, cheering for her son. As his father stood on the edge of the front row waving his arms, it was difficult for him to keep up and kept from laughing. That would not be the first time some of this family's close friends have joined Smith-Schuster in a draft room. Smith-Schuster's father attended his first pro day in college and Nicole made multiple trips in the days leading up to the draft in February. She knew her son would be chosen well before her. They had met with coach Mike Tomlin, general manager Kevin Colbert and general manager Kevin Colbert's father, Andy, on multiple visits earlier in the week. "I was really proud of how he handled things and showed us and our teammates he's a humble guy," Smith-Schuster said. "That kind of stuck with me the whole way up here and going all the way. It's going to be tough but I'm ready to go." His father was also surprised that his son went to West Virginia over USC. "I wanted him to go to USC, but it didn't really matter," JuJu said. "Coach (Paul) Wulff had a great relationship with (former Steelers offensive coordinator) Todd Haley and the people at USC and he really wanted to be there for them but it didn't work out. They (the coaching staff) gave me the option. "And they were the second team in the draft so I was happy I made the decision. I was thankful for the decision because Coach Wulff gave me a chance and it worked out." There is little doubt where Smith-Schuster has been the most dedicated of all college players. He worked hard to get in better shape during his first season but felt it was too late. That changed last June. He moved into his high school's dorm building as a ninth-grader for a month at a time, working out in the weight room before the entire team came to his room for workouts. He'd spend his lunch break in the cafeteria, working on his nutrition, and it helped him gain some weight around the same time during the season. In a season where he caught 69 passes for 1,054 yards and 14 touchdowns in 13 games, he also had to deal with the fact that his quarterback, JuJu, had a broken collarbone with one game to play. "They didn't want us to start slow like (Washington running back) Chris Thompson and do a lot of damage to our team," Tomlin said of JuJu, referring to last season's No. 6-ranked rushing team. "We felt like there was a chance in the NFL. You can never take too much time off because it could turn into injury. He's an exciting player and has all the tools to become an established pro." But despite that, Smith-Schuster said he wasn't disappointed he didn't go higher than a round later. It was never about the money, but he wanted to play football, and he wanted to make the most of it. "There was no question for me on how I feel about JuJu being draft," said receiver Sammie Coates. "This is JuJu Smith-Schuster we're talking about, not, 'OK, let's go get a few more yards.' It was him who decided he was going to do that and he did it in a positive way. "When he steps on the football field, he has all the tools to be productive. When our offensive line does what they're supposed to do, we're one of the top offenses in the league." Pittsburgh general manager Kevin Colbert acknowledged that he and his colleagues went in knowing that not all is well in the running back room, which was supposed to have two rookie starters, Dalvin Cook and Samaje Perine. Smith-Schuster's father, a former offensive lineman for Texas, was the starter in 2014 before getting hurt. However, Smith-Schuster said it was an added bonus when he	0
It was inevitable. While it was widely believed that Donald Trump Jr. could've been in some serious legal trouble if he gave up the incriminating emails between himself and Rob Goldstone, that may be premature. The Daily Caller reports that a "recent source" tells them that Trump Jr. is not expected to face additional legal repercussions, despite a federal grand jury being impaneled to investigate him and the Trump team's ties to Russia. Specifically, the source says that there's only the possibility of criminal charges for "willful violation of banking regulations," while there's also a "zero" chance of Trump Jr. even being indicted. The source told TheDC that Trump Jr. was only indicted "for being a smart person and for being honest." While Trump Jr. was undoubtedly trying to get his father elected during the 2016 campaign, the Daily Caller noted that "it's hard to fathom why people believe he was acting on his own, when it wasn't possible or logical." The report further added that he's in "no legal jeopardy" and will remain a member of the White House staff moving forward. That's not to say this is a good thing for Team Trump. The president himself reportedly had a lot of legal, diplomatic, and political headaches that could've been prevented by knowing better about Russia than Trump and his team. Even more importantly though, in light of the numerous other investigations into the White House and Trump family members, this is yet another opportunity for the president to be held accountable.	0
Laravel 5.2 Laravel is an object-relational mapper for PHP. Building on the ideas of Eloquent, MySQL, and other common database tools, it's the most popular and widely-used MVC framework for PHP development. Laravel is the default PHP MVC framework, used by millions of applications. Laravel is a fully-featured, highly-concise, and fully documented yet lightweight application framework for the PHP programming language. Table of Contents Installation There are two options when installing Laravel: Install through Composer : composer global require laravel/laravel-migrations When installing Laravel through Composer, you may use the --prefer-dist option, which will install the application and its dependencies within the dist directory of the Composer package. If you prefer to install the application through the Laravel installer, use the --prefer-dist option when installing the Laravel repository instead. : Use the Laravel CLI If you're not comfortable with Composer and want to install Laravel via the Laravel CLI, run the following commands: $ php composer.phar require laravel/laravel-migrations $ php composer.phar require laravel/laravel-migrations:install $ php artisan migrate Note that after executing the above commands, your Laravel 5 installation will remain in the same location where you ran those commands. Once this process is complete, you should remove this directory from your site's public folder manually. Configuration The most important command you'll need to learn is the one that defines the database connection: app/Http/Console/Controllers/Migrations.php Use the migrate:migrate Artisan command to create and manage migrations: php artisan migrate Updating your database Updating your database is really easy! If you are using the default database schema, all we need to do is run: php artisan migrate --table="test" And that's it! Now all the updates will be created and the database table will be updated. If you are updating from a previous version of the library, you can run: php artisan migrate:upgrade If you would like to check what table is being used for the new migration, you may use this command: php artisan migrate:table You may also run this command to check what migrations are currently in progress: php artisan migrate:status Dependency Management If you are updating from the Laravel 5 installation, you will also want to make sure that the Migrate library is updated! Update your composer.json file so that the migrations dependency is updated: "composer.json": { "require": { "laravel/migrations": "~4.1" } } Publish and Publish-Subscribe Service Providers This Laravel 5 module offers a set of convenient command-line utilities, which make working with E-Commerce a breeze. Most of the functionality is provided by the public/ directory of the library. To use these utilities to make your life easier, simply place them in the public/ directory of your site. Below is a listing of the available commands that may be used to publish new E-Commerce products and products to your web store. These commands can also be used to subscribe to product information from an E-Commerce store, if you haven't already enabled this functionality: Commands Description publish Publish a new product. create Create a new product. list List all the products in your E-Commerce store. view View the list of products in your current store. delete Delete a product. subscribe Subscribe to a product for the current store. You may configure up to 5 subscriptions for a single product and up to 15 products at a time in the config/config.php file of your E-Commerce application.	0
In a statement, Mr. McCain said he hoped his colleagues on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee would consider his proposal and work swiftly to pass it. The measure, he said, would give "the president of the United States greater flexibility in dealing with countries where our intelligence and law enforcement agencies believe that the situation requires our continued engagement, as well as in situations where we have taken appropriate security precautions to limit the risk even further, but we could not be sure the situation posed no ongoing danger to Americans working overseas."

Mikulski, Democrat of Maryland; the chairwoman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said in a statement, "I applaud Senator McCain for coming forward with a bold, bipartisan approach to this critical issue that would provide our intelligence and law enforcement officials with additional flexibility to work where and when necessary to keep the American people and their service members safe." The bill would also give the secretary of state "the flexibility to designate certain countries where non-American citizens may be detained for the purposes of interrogation or detention, as set forth in U.S. foreign policy directives." It would also give certain counterterrorism officials the authority to detain terrorist suspects in the United States for short periods, in part to allow them to work with their local law enforcement and intelligence partners to thwart terrorism plots. The bill comes in the same week as Congress will hold its first hearings on the administration's plans to close the prison at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , a controversial measure that is sure to be debated on the campaign trail this fall. Advertisement Continue reading the main story While there have been several congressional attempts, including an unsuccessful effort by Senator John McCain in 2005, to give the president greater latitude in setting the parameters of interrogation, no such legislation has succeeded in recent years. In a statement, the White House said it had yet to review the legislation.	0
Cancer Treatment Information About cancer or breast cancer Your treatment option and options depend on what stage or grade of cervical cancer you have. For more information, see stage of cancer. Cervical cancer treatment (treatment options) In North America: Most cervical cancer treatment starts with a surgical procedure. In the United States, doctors perform the majority of these procedures. Some doctors use radiation or chemotherapy instead of a surgical procedure. The type of treatment and the doctor you see depends on your stage of disease and your own circumstances. In Canada: Many cervical cancer patients in Canada get chemotherapy. A small proportion have surgery. The type of treatment and the doctor you see depends on your stage of disease and your own circumstances. Cervical cancer treatment does not usually make your life any shorter. However, there are some specific procedures, procedures, and tests that may make your life more difficult. These may affect the way you will be able to live a normal and healthy life while you are undergoing treatment. For more information about cancer, watch these videos: You can learn about the treatment you will receive, your own treatment plan, treatment options, and your recovery by downloading the information below and talking to a doctor, nurse, specialist, or registered nurse, or attending a clinic or other source of information: What does cancer mean to me? When cancer strikes, it destroys and changes your body. You might lose your hair, your voice, your strength, and your ability to do many things you used to be able to do. Most people can expect to have a good quality of life with treatment for certain types of cancer. Cancer is sometimes a life-long illness. For some cancers, it can cause death (cancers with a 10- or 90-year survival rate) or an indefinite period of illness (cancers with a 5-year survival rate) with surgery being the most effective for most cancers. For most cancers with a 5-year survival rate, the likelihood of death increases with a patient's age and with the stage of cancer (a 5-year survival rate of 20% means that one 5-year old would generally survive). The risk of dying is also increased for certain subtypes of cervical cancer or for certain types of women. Many people survive their first cancer bout. Your survival depends on many factors, and it may increase over time. For example, most women who die of cervical cancer are first diagnosed at the time of their late 40s or early 50s. If treatment is started as early as possible, most women will live or can expect to have a good quality of life. For most women whose first cancer is not diagnosed in their 40s or 50s, there is usually a 50-fold decrease in the chance of becoming a survivor. Survivors are at higher risk of developing new cancers and cancer-related complications (like death) and having additional surgeries such as hysterectomies and mastectomies. The treatment and support they receive while they are taking the medication for their cancer play an important role in their overall health as well as in their chances of recurrence, though research is still ongoing. Cancers after the first one When the first cancer is diagnosed, the chance of getting a second cancer decreases by about 30%. However, about 35%-70% of women will get a new cancer at any time in their lives, especially if they have certain high risk genetic conditions, they haven't received treatment early, and their cancer doesn't respond to treatment. The treatment for new cancers varies depending on whether the cancer is in the breast (lobular carcinoma), the neck (cervical carcinoma), or the bones (osteosarcoma). For some cancers, the surgery or chemotherapy may be different after the first cancer. Cancer before the 1st When the cancer occurs before its first stage, the chance of dying decreases. About 90% of women who survive cervical cancer are alive at 6 months after the first cancer diagnosis. If you are diagnosed with cervical cancer before its first stage and don't have certain genetic conditions, your chances of surviving are higher in certain circumstances. Your chances are better with: a pelvic exam and Pap test, if your breast or ovary has been found abnormal (biopsy) a biopsy done to check the back and the cervix, if the cancer has reached the back of your neck or the uterus (cervical spindle) more frequent Pap smear tests a biopsy done to help find and treat ovarian and bladder cancers in both women and men medication at earlier stages of the disease (for example, more chemotherapy), as well as regular Pap tests (pap and colposcopy) breast-feeding. Women who have not had a Pap test or colposcopy	0

When it comes to the use of social media, it can be hard to know how to be discreet and still be effective. So I thought I'd give some pointers to help you understand the difference between your typical Instagram or Twitter user and someone who is using social networking sites in a more serious manner. To start, you can't just say "I'm an Instagram user" and assume you won't get caught. But by following these steps, you can increase your chances of not getting discovered. Instagram is a free app on your mobile browser. To download, click here or go to "Apps" in your mobile browser. The easiest way to get noticed is to post a lot. This sounds obvious, but when you start posting more photos you will notice that people will stop and watch out for photos of you. There's no better way to get attention. Start a regular schedule It's easy to get caught up in the moment and only post something if it's something you like. But when you post daily, there aren't enough images of you to use in comparison to others. This will give you a more realistic image of what your followers can look past. Try to avoid taking photos when you're getting ready for a night out or getting ready for bed. If you plan to post a photo during the day, go for a more subdued photo. Don't overdo anything It's not a good idea to post something more than once a day. Even if you do post the same photo two or three times a day, it can be harder to tell if it holds anyone's attention. Instead, post more often when you're in a good mood. You'll also get more exposure if you post photos that are humorous and make fun of yourself instead of those that are serious. Don't overuse hashtags I don't use hashtags very often, but when I do I make sure to pick up on some of the popular posts and try to incorporate them into my posts. But don't try to post every 10 minutes. It's also a good idea to stick to one hashtag, such as #happy, #proud and #fave. Don't post inappropriate pictures This is tough to say for sure, but some people believe that this is the number one factor most people will follow you based on social media. I'm not a fan of this so I usually try to stay clean. Don't use photos with excessive amounts of text or too much of an impact to the view. This is one of the reasons why I only post one photo every two hours (this is a lot for some Instagram users; it just takes me a bit longer to make my photos). Don't post pics that aren't taken from the actual location where you're attending. This can be a common reason why someone gets noticed online. Don't post photos at a time when it is cold outside This was a huge one. I got a lot of attention because I posted a photo from a cold location, and I have not posted on Instagram since. Don't show your face online You wouldn't be on your phone, or even Instagram, if you were not trying to make your presence known. This will take a lot of time to build trust on social media, meaning you will definitely not get discovered. Make sure you add hashtags for you and your followers Some people don't like hashtags, so use these instead: #me (this is your username) or #yourusername It makes it very clear who you are, and who your followers are Add your Twitter name or username This helps people follow you when you add it as a username You can also add your Facebook and Google Plus accounts as well Create content that is your style When creating content for an Instagram account, I will try to create something that's specific to my interests, whether it is a photo of me riding my bike along my favorite mountain bike trail or a photo of me hiking through a field of wildflowers. Don't post anything that you're not comfortable sharing with other people This is easy to say, so I'll have to repeat myself: Don't post anything that you're not comfortable posting to people. This means your content should be personal and not out of place for your chosen platform. Don't take photos of animals or other things that can harm or attract animals There have been times where a photo that was taken with the best of intentions ended up being a huge embarrassment. People will also try to take photos of wild animals in order to get more attention. These include photos of elephants, birds, animals from nature, people, etc etc Avoid posts with words in them! If you're new to blogging and you want to get noticed on social media, I highly suggest you change the language you	0
GitHub, a site where programmers collaborate to develop open source software, became the most-visited site on the Internet last month, according to a new study. The report was published Thursday by the Institute for the Future, a think tank based in Silicon Valley that looks at social, technological and economic trends, and is funded by Microsoft and other tech giants. "It's sort of a little bit startling, but it does actually show how this open source platform is having a huge effect in terms of how people have adopted new technologies," said Andrew Keen, the institute's associate director. To assess how people adopt new web services, the institute looked at Alexa, which measures the number of page hits an area receives from search engines. The institute said that Alexa ranks GitHub.com No. 1 in a search for "code repositories online," with the website's traffic ranking climbing to nearly 10 million hits last month. The ranking surprised some experts. "It was really the first time any major source I'd seen came out and looked at this ranking," said Brian Solis, vice president for industry analysis with Tech Internet, a market-research firm.	0
This project is deprecated and has been replaced by the 'freetype2' library. The fteetothem extension lets you embed TrueType fonts contained in TeX files into LaTeX documents. The included fonts for the default version of Emacs are included in this distribution. You can find more information about fteetothem on this website and the documentation. The current version (1.0) supports the following: Emacs 24+ LaTeX 2.5 The following fonts (with a version of 1.5 or higher): This will be replaced with the 'freetype2' library during 2.5. fteetothem supports all TrueType formats. It is intended mostly for displaying fonts contained in TeX documents within Emacs. Freetype 2.0 supports TrueType fonts, but it still has some quirks. If you are using TrueType fonts with fteetothem you may still experience some issues (but if you are using TrueType fonts with Emacs's default font set (usually set by M-x load-theme ), all should be fine). If you do not meet the "TrueType fonts, Emacs" target, you can install TeX Live for TrueType fonts compatibility in this section and then use fteetothem in Emacs in the "Faster output" (see below). Installation You may install fteetothem using el-get , MELPA or via package.el directly, or you may download the latest source code and build fteetothem from source (see below). Please note that version 1.0 is based on version 1.0.2 of fteetothem . You may use version 2.0.x of fteetothem , though, if you are willing to deal with some extra work. Emacs packages In Emacs 16.x (and newer) only: If you are using version 25 or later Emacs, package-install fteetothem ; otherwise package-install fteetothem via el-get (see below for how to do this). These versions are not compatible with the older versions 1.0 of fteetothem which are based on version 1.0. ; otherwise via (see below for how to do this). These versions are not compatible with the older versions 1.0 of fteetothem which are based on version 1.0. Install via MELPA (see below) if you use el-get , or if you have MELPA 1.15 or later. MELPA packages If you aren't using version 25 or later of Emacs, MELPA packages fteetothem and fteetothem-theme (but not fteetothem-extras ): M-x package-install (but not): M-x package-install RET fteetothem RET fteetothem-theme RET You may also install fteetothem from the MELPA.org repository. To use fteetothem without installing MELPA, you can add a custom package to your load-path and then load fteetothem with M-x load-theme <RET> . Emacs 21+? Some users have had trouble with M+ . Use M-x load-theme <RET> instead. If you use Emacs 21+ you may need to add a custom variable fteetothem-custom (a string like "c:/program files (x86)/freetype/freetype.xpm" or similar). This is required for the "freetype2" plugin to be installed properly. (use-package fteetothem :ensure t ; ; custom variables fteetothem-custom ) How to use the theme The fteetothem-theme package can be configured to use the default settings for fteetothem using a key binding in the global-map . To disable fteetothem's font rendering functionality, just use the setting :font-lock-mode to disable font rendering for fteetothem . Note fteetothem-theme should not be used together with any other feature. For example using fteetothem the same way as the default font setting doesn't work, since the default font setting uses an older version of the fteetothem extension. The default colors in fteetothem-theme are defined in fteetothem.el . Caveats The default Emacs font rendering is probably not as good as one would expect. I don't know precisely how the actual font rendering works, but I've tried several solutions to try and make	0
Greetings all! We've been working very hard to bring together a few more things to the public in the next couple of weeks. One of which is the upcoming expansion to the "Tales of the Black Freighter" scenario. There were just too many options and components included to just release them as one big box set. It also wouldn't be fair to do all this work and then only ship them out a few more weeks. So instead we're splitting this out into a few smaller packs, to give you more options and be more fair to our backers. They'll be available on our website, or in-game via the in-game marketplace at a later date...  First up is the expansion packs...  The "Black Freighter" (1x scenario, 1x bonus/artbook, 0x expansion)  The "Greece" expansion (3x scenario, 3x bonus/artbook)  The "Lebanon" expansion (4x scenario, 4x bonus/artbook)  Lastly, the "Algeria" expansion (4x scenario, 4x bonus/artbook)  They should arrive before Christmas, if everything works out.  We'll let you know when the pre-order period for these open again!	0

The world is awash in data, and as you may have guessed by now, data science isn't immune to the same problems that plague other fields like marketing and marketing. Many times, data that's generated by these other fields can be used by companies, but sometimes they can backfire, causing consumers to stop using specific products. For example, if a company has a relationship with a certain brand, then the brand can benefit from having good data on how their specific demographic uses its product. One such example is Google's AdSense service. When you type in a URL in Google search, you are sent an ad which includes the search term. This is done because certain keywords are often very lucrative to ad prices. A very large part of Google's revenue comes from the millions of ads which they serve on top of the normal search results. To make sure they weren't just playing favorites, AdSense has started pulling in data about this data, and then serving targeted ads to specific types of people. In other words, Google is hoping to learn the preferences and needs of its customers, so that it can predict which ads to serve based on your past behavior within the company. Advertisers have gotten in on the action, with a growing number of companies willing to place advertising within the search results, in response to this data – some of which, such as Coca-Cola and Amazon.com, are even making money off of it. But if data from any type of search is used for advertising purposes, then how is that used by companies in the industry? For example, if you are researching the most effective sunscreen for your skin, you may be shown a variety of different sunscreen brands. This is to give you a way of comparing which one would be the best for you. It goes the same for the data on your favorite drinks and foods, where companies like Nestle are getting rich from analyzing your preferences and purchasing history to predict which of their products might be most likely to be your next favorite. It's an incredibly rich field of data, and when the companies who collect it for the sake of "advertising" are looking into your history – their goal is typically to serve you products that you might not have thought of before, but that then you may be more likely to buy. "There's a tremendous amount of data on us, it's just not used for advertising-type purposes," says Nick Diener, a PhD student at University of Washington who is studying the implications of this data mining. This is a common scenario in the other "real" industries as well, and the issue is that most people are quite comfortable with giving up control over their choices – that is, until you ask them to give up control over who uses their data. "There's a difference between data that we have that's free for us to use and data that has monetary value," Diener says. In other words, Google is paying AdSense to tell them what consumers have been searching for, so that it can show them ads based on these search queries. In addition to the data in real-world products and services, we have other types of data that we have collected for many years. For example, we might have purchased a car or a computer which we now use. In that case, data about these goods can be used for advertising, because someone else has found it useful. Similarly, we might have a history of shopping on Amazon, which is in turn used to track whether or not customers are likely to purchase our items. This type of data, while useful, can also be potentially dangerous, as it can allow a single person to effectively control the entire market. If you aren't careful, though, even your own data could be used, to the detriment of those less fortunate than you. "If I'm the owner of data about my health, I want someone who's trying to create a device like this to know that they can't have this data taken – they know the data is valuable, and they're trying to use it for good," says Diener. According to Diener, his research will show to people that "you can use these data in a number of different ways, but the most common is just to make stuff. You can use data, for instance about who you're likely to turn to in an emergency – you can use it for the purposes of marketing, by saying that your health issues, which might be a problem with a heart condition or something, could be solved by this device you're looking at. You could use it in a lot of ways that I think are unethical." Unfortunately, such abuses aren't likely to stop with Google, as all of the data that companies collect has now opened up a Pandora's Box of potential abuses. According to Diener, data mining "is a form of economic blackmail of its members." The data collected by this "economies of scale" can be used to	0
Fernando Velasco-Mesquita will begin a seven-day trial in Barcelona on Friday morning, as he continues to recover from a dislocated shoulder that cost the Spaniard a chance at the 2014 season-opener. Velasco-Mesquita suffered the injury on training at the start of training on Tuesday and a full rehabilitation will take until November, leading him to miss the Spanish round, which brings the WorldTour into force. However, Velasco-Mesquita is now in line to return to racing – and potentially a podium finish - for the Clasica San Sebastian in September. Velasco-Mesquita was one of the few Spaniards on the start grid at Tour De France Velasco-Mesquita, who also won the Spanish national road race championships in April and May, suffered an ankle injury which ruled him out of last Sunday's second stage of the Vuelta a Espana – and he will need to undergo an ankle adjustment before participating in the Clasica. "The injury will take a month to heal, so I need to do as much rehabilitation as possible to get myself ready for the Clasica," Velasco-Mesquita said. "This is not a big problem, but when I started training again I was unable to do much because of pain. So I am just happy to get out on the bike again. Even if it's not an easy course there will be a lot of chances to do well. "I am fully aware I have a difficult road ahead, but what matters most to me is that I'm still able to compete and start the season with a win." The trial will not be the first time Velasco-Mesquita takes part in the Spanish race, as he finished ninth at the inaugural edition in 2013. "In the end I think it was only a few seconds that separated me from the top, after the climb and the technical descent. I tried to push my limits and go for a stage win but it wasn't to be, so I had to settle for seventh," he recalled. After recovering from his injury last year, Velasco-Mesquita went on to take second overall at the U23 Giro del Trentino, which brought the UCI WorldTour into being, and the 23-year-old hopes to do the same at Tour de France level at the weekend. "I also have a feeling that I will be here, fighting for the win against the best UCI pro riders," Velasco-Mesquita said. "I'm already feeling that way, but in reality the race is a long way from here, I still believe in myself and I'm going to try my luck." Full press conference transcript:	0
An 18-year-old boy shot six times during a street fight with another kid has died, police said. The shooting happened at 6:40 p.m. Tuesday at the corner of West 47th and Wabash streets in South Side Park, according to Chicago police. Witnesses told police the first shots were fired when six teens got out of a van that had been stopped at a red light. They then proceeded to fight and shots were fired as they ran, police said in a statement. Two of the teens were struck and taken to Advocate Illinois Masonic Medical Center, where they're being treated. The other teens were hit in the arm and the abdomen, police said. One of three suspects was arrested at the scene, said Officer Jose Estrada, a Chicago police spokesman. His name hasn't been released, but officials said he was 18 years old. There was no information on any of the teens' conditions Wednesday afternoon.	0
I really don't understand this: "The reason I don't take pictures with people is to protect myself from people I don't know. I would never, ever take your picture if it wasn't safe to take. I'm not interested in meeting anyone, and most people are too."  What? So even if you're not interested in meeting the person in the photo, you're still fine with them knowing it? Like this is something that really bothered you? "I don't take pictures with people. It's so I can protect myself if people I don't know approach me in a bad way. For that reason, I tend to avoid photographing any kind of situations where there are strangers or acquaintances who are not involved in the conversation." (source) You're making it seem like everyone else is wrong when they actually were just protecting themselves. Like when someone makes rude comments on a public sidewalk, but you'll just shrug it off and continue staring at that pretty girl you saw on the subway.  If the person isn't bothering you for some reason then you shouldn't even be on their radar, let alone take their picture without consent.  So what am I supposed to do? If they're taking my picture without asking, why should I be okay with that?	0
SACRAMENTO, Calif. (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump will use the state-of-the-union address to attack China, and "deter them from taking advantage of America's weaknesses with a currency manipulator," a top Republican from California said on Thursday. U.S. President Donald Trump speaks as Education Secretary-designate Betsy DeVos (L) looks on during a meeting with (from left) U.S. Vice President Mike Pence, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY), Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer and House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (2nd L) at the White House in Washington, U.S., February 9, 2017. REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque California's Governor Jerry Brown and other Democrats have made clear they will target Trump's potential tax reform push at businesses moving operations overseas, saying those moves have cost U.S. jobs, prompting Trump to attack Democrats specifically last weekend. In his 2016 election campaign, Trump threatened to slap higher tariffs on Chinese goods than he would on imports from other countries, although he has not specified what changes he might make to deal with a trade imbalance with China. "You are going to see California's president address that," said California Democratic Representative Adam Schiff, a close ally of Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer of New York. "It will be in stark, stark contrast to anything that president Trump will say." Schiff did not rule out a new tax on China, but he said Trump would be "trying to get China to engage in a bilateral discussion" without Congress. House Republican Bill Flores dismissed criticism of the president being too negative, saying Democrats wanted to paint Trump in a bad light during his speech. Trump has said his administration has accomplished more in a few months than most presidents in their first year. Democrats, who boycotted the 2011 State of the Union address after former Republican President George Bush used his speech to criticize former Democratic President Barack Obama without mentioning him. The White House said on Thursday Trump planned to unveil a new immigration proposal late next month. It did not cite details of what plan would call for but Trump met with business leaders over the weekend and could use the meeting to outline a more comprehensive immigration policy. Trump had been expected to roll out a more sweeping border security plan after he secured the support of conservative lawmakers and the Republican Study Committee. He has also suggested he may expand the war against Islamic State militants with the new immigration plan. California already requires foreign buyers of new homes to obtain a buyer's permit and has required local agencies to report a backlog of transactions. It also banned people with criminal records from buying a home. Brown said in an interview on Thursday he was pleased that Trump had asked the Pentagon and the Department of Homeland Security to take action on the problem of illegal immigrants who have been convicted of crime. "We're getting some good news, but we can't have all of these illegal immigrants buying homes, especially in a state like California that wants to preserve and promote homeownership," he said. A poll released by the University of California Center for Political Studies said Californians' support for legal immigration, which has long been a big issue in the state's politics, was dropping. Forty-five percent of Californians said immigrants helped the state economically, down from 57 percent last year.	0
PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to examine the efficacy of four treatment strategies for non‐malignant (included in the definition of breast cancer) breast carcinoma in women with an existing diagnosis at a tertiary centre. METHODS: This is a non‐randomised, controlled, crossover trial. Women ≥ 20 years old recruited by advertising were randomly assigned to three sessions comprising of two and four treatments; all subjects were assessed pre‐ and post‐treatment based on clinical response. RESULTS: Over the course of the intervention, 48 subjects were assessed in two sessions. Twenty‐six subjects (53%) in the two‐ and four‐session groups achieved clinical response. Six subjects (11%) did not achieve response after two sessions while eight subjects (21%) in the two‐session group and eight subjects (17%) in the four‐session group achieved non‐response. The two‐ and four‐session groups had statistically significant improvements in the incidence of all breast tumours (relative risk (RR) 2.06, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.40-3.33 and 1.28, 95% CI .72-.84 respectively), in the grade 4/5 breast tumours (RR 3.14, 95% CI 1.44-6.00 and 1.17, 95% CI .63-.94 respectively), and in the grade 0/1 breast cells (RR 10.06, 95% CI 1.32-48.6 and 4.39, 95% CI .38-.96 respectively) by three months after the intervention, compared with the baseline. CONCLUSIONS: The two and four‐session approaches to the management of this disease demonstrate a significant ability to improve the outcomes of patients and are well tolerated. Clinical efficacy with the four‐session approach is similar to that of two‐ and three‐session approaches, and represents a significant advance in the management of this disease in women.	0
A woman accused of leaving her two young sons at a church in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., was charged with four counts of child abandonment Friday, police said. Carolyn Toney, 49, and her sons, 8-year-old James and 9-year-old John, had gone to church at 8 a.m. Thursday, police spokesman Alvaro Zabaleta said. When they arrived, her sons were outside their bedroom door, with only a blanket in between them. Toney told police the boys had gone hungry for an entire school day, so she made up a meal that she put on the table in their room, Zabaleta said. The boys' parents, who were not identified, were in the church during the meal, and they got hungry as well, Toney told police. According to a statement from police, the children, who remain at the home with Toney and her children's uncle, had not eaten their breakfast, lunch or dinner. At 1:30 p.m. Friday morning, Toney allegedly showed up at the home with her 3-year-old son and handed him two pieces of food and then left to go to Wal-Mart with a 12-year-old daughter. When Toney didn't return home until 4:30 p.m., police responded to her home at 1225 East Fort Lauderdale Road, where they found her son and daughter, who were eating a pizza. The boy's father had left at 1:30 p.m. and the family hadn't eaten their dinner since they got to church, police said. The children's uncle was also at the scene and told police that he had called the church to see what was going on before going upstairs and hearing that Toney had left her kids at the church. The uncle also told police that Toney was not wearing a jacket or scarf on Thursday and that she had not asked him to take care of the boys. An officer later took the child's picture on a poster board and then took a picture of her before placing it into evidence, police said. Toney will be arraigned on Friday afternoon at 9 a.m.	0

In the latest installment of the "I'm not mad anymore, and everything is alright" series, the Minnesota Vikings are one of the teams that had the franchise's worst run of seasons in 2012. It's now 2012 again. The Vikings may be 0-8, but you just have to smile to yourself right now. The Vikings' 2013 season is still almost a month away, and this time, the Vikings are all smiles. "I think we are all in a good place," Vikings coach Leslie Frazier wrote on The Players' Tribune. "We all see a lot of things that we can do better, but I also see a lot of things that we still have room to grow on." The NFL has gone wild, but there remain a few silver linings in this Vikings mess:	0
On a morning drive on Interstate 89 in northern Wisconsin, Michael Noll, 41, saw a tractor-trailer stop and a man in the backseat run from it. Noll, who was driving home from a conference in New Jersey with his wife and son, pulled over and called 911. He didn't know whether the driver made it out of the wreckage with her son. Noll never made it out of the wreckage. Instead, he died in a fatal crash in 2011 while driving with a suspended license. Authorities said the driver, 43-year-old John Gebhardt, was "completely sober" at the time of the crash and cited his failure to put on a seat belt as a major factor in the tragedy. On Tuesday, Gebhardt pleaded guilty to misdemeanor vehicular homicide, a misdemeanor, in Walker County Circuit Court. He will serve 45 days in the county jail. Gebhardt told the judge he was remorseful for his actions. "I don't regret driving fast," he said, according to the Journal Sentinel. "I don't regret what happened and I don't regret what I've been through." Assistant District Attorney David Smith, a prosecutor in Wisconsin, said Gebhardt's actions "were totally reckless because he knew he was driving drunk." Noll was driving 75 mph on a stretch of interstate known as U.S. 31-91 in Green Bay when he saw Gebhardt, who was pulling out of the road. Noll told investigators that he followed the tractor trailer, which hit a guardrail on the interstate just north of Green Bay. Smith said that Gebhardt failed to turn on his emergency lights, didn't put on the seat belt and drove off before Noll called 911. The crash occurred three to five minutes after Gebhardt saw the crash, according to the Journal Sentinel. Noll managed to pull the family of four out of the vehicle after his body ended up pinned underneath the mangled tractor trailer, the prosecutor said. The newspaper stated that Noll's wife was hospitalized for a week with back injuries. The son was treated in a local hospital for facial and head injuries. Gebhardt was sentenced in a plea deal to two years of partial suspension. He will be under the supervision of probation for three years. He will also have to do 120 hours of community service. Copyright 2016: Associated Press ---------------------------------------------------------------------- UPDATED Monday, June 15, 2015---1:50 p.m. MADISON, Wis. (AP) -- A Wisconsin man convicted of drunk driving after a fatal crash is facing more than three dozen charges, including multiple felonies. John Gebhardt, 43, of Green Bay, pleaded guilty Tuesday in a deal with prosecutors. He faces up to 21 years in prison when he's sentenced July 13 in a Walker County courtroom. The Associated Press learned of Gebhardt's plea while reviewing court records. Walker County Circuit Court records show that Gebhardt was scheduled to enter a plea Wednesday. Gebhardt was driving 75 mph in a 85-mph zone on northbound I-89 just north of Green Bay in February 2011. He failed to turn on his headlights and didn't use the seat belt. A Wisconsin State Patrol investigation later found that he also failed to stop using his turn signal. Authorities said Gebhardt, who didn't have a Wisconsin license, was "completely sober" when he fatally crashed his pickup, which was carrying his wife and two young sons. Copyright 2015: Associated Press -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- UPDATED Thursday, April 19, 2015---2:30 p.m. MADISON, Wis. (AP) -- A Wisconsin man known for playing a "mad scientist" on TV has been sentenced to more than 20 years behind bars for causing the fiery deaths of his family with the drunken driving of a truck. A judge Thursday sentenced John Gebhardt to 21 years in prison, more than nine years longer than prosecutors sought. Gebhardt's victims sat stone faced in a courtroom as Judge Patrick Wigenton sentenced Gebhardt with the words of a victim impact statement: "We have lost three family members that were like a large family to us." Assistant District Attorney David Smith told the judge Gebhardt "was driving without a license and a seat belt -- two factors you know he didn't know he would be facing" in the June 2010 crash. Prosecutors said Gebhardt had a blood-alcohol level more than twice the legal limit when the wreck occurred when he was driving a pickup truck carrying his wife and two sons around 11 p.m. in Green Bay. Gebhardt's children were ejected from their car and died. Their father's seat belt kept him from being thrown from the truck when it began to burn. Copyright 2015: Associated Press 	0
A few nights ago, the first episode of the fourth season of The Office aired. It was a huge success. While a majority of the episode was dedicated to the characters' relationship with each other, one segment was dedicated to the company as a whole. It's not hard to see why. It all started with Pam. In Pam's first scene of the night, she sits in her office drinking coffee. There are only five or so people in the building. But wait. Before she gets up, she calls Jim, who has already left for work. Pam: "Hey Jim, is that [Jim's] car? I think he's driving down." Jim: "Yeah. She left earlier. Should I ask her if she's okay?" No! Why do that? Don't you know how to treat her friend like a real person? As the episode ended, Jim walked into Pam's office just as she was about to call him. We later find out that he was in there all along. The Office has always tried to portray the world of the office as a place where everyone is in on the joke and in on the joke together. At the end of each episode, the staff of Dunder Mifflin makes an appearance. But it's the character of Pam who embodies all of the aforementioned characteristics. That's because Pam is one of the few people in the office who understands Jim's humor. She's actually on a firstname basis with most of the other employees. Pam is a perfect example of what I believe to be what "characterization" is all about. We see everyone else in the office, but we only see a few people in Pam's world. We never actually get to see the full spectrum of Pam's personality. She's almost always seen as "smart", "gifted", and "entitled" in Jim and the office. But what we do experience is a few things: Pam's intelligence is what helps her make the jokes she makes, though even then sometimes we're seeing things that we would not necessarily think of when they are told on television. In real life, Pam would not always do things out of her character. In the episode when Jim asked for the company car, he asks for Pam's opinion because he knows that she doesn't know the difference between American and European cars. But Pam has done this kind of thing a million times before in the office. The other "character" traits she exhibits are her gift of gab and how she is always ready to offer someone else's opinion on anything. This is why she's the main character of the show. Pam's character makes no sense as presented in the show. That's why I call it "characterization". Now let's look at Jim. When the characters come together in "The New Monuments", the story goes on to detail Jim's first encounter with Jim Halpert. Jim: "Okay, Jim, how's the new monke… monu… thing going?" Jim's co-worker: "Um, not great. [Laughs] You need to get out more." If Jim had just asked Pam how things were, the show's portrayal of that interaction would have taken an unexpected and somewhat silly turn. Instead, we experience Jim's reaction, with its full consequences. Not only does Jim lose Pam's friendship, but now he's seen as selfish by her. At the end of the episode, you can see Pam's face in Jim's back pocket. What that says to us is that while Pam probably would have been happy talking to Jim about his life, Jim's reaction could have really damaged Pam's reputation for a while. Jim is our role model. We see Jim's reaction to Pam in his face, but we can also say as Pam's character develops in The Office, she has to show us what it's like before she can say anything in Jim's defense. It's the same for everyone else in the office. Our view of them is conditioned by what we've been told. And as a result, we are often blind to what other people think about us. People are not real. They're made up. There are other people's thoughts, and other people's opinions, all of which are just as valid as any we might think of ourselves. So when we think of the character of Pam, we need to remember that she would have said the same thing back then. She probably would have said the exact same thing again. And if she did say it again, wouldn't she have changed how she was thinking of his actions? I know I would have. Because she is my role model. I'd say that the character of Jim Halpert is also my role model. Jim is my role model because	0

The FOIA officer may then either complete the request or will notify the requester of the status of the request and will also request written comments from individuals and groups of individuals who have views or objections to the document, agency or agency position, or to the request under consideration. Information may be withheld if it would harm classified or sensitive national security information, would reveal the identities of confidential human sources, or would reveal any other exception that limits the use of the information or records sought. Examples of information withheld under these criteria include, but are not limited to, information related to specific individuals or programs, specific locations of the Agency, or information deemed to contain trade secrets or commercial secrets 4. How information can be provided Although the requester should be as specific as possible when describing the requested information or records, and must indicate the information or records sought and any exceptions that apply, the Agency cannot always respond to your request without knowing the subject of the request. If this is the case, an Agency liaison must contact you in accordance with Agency procedures. A requester who does not wish to participate in that interaction should submit a statement to the Agency requesting confidentiality, and you should provide the Agency the necessary information to support your request. All Agency records are open to public inspection and copying in accordance with the Freedom of Information Act. 5. How can you appeal a denial of a FOIA request? An unsuccessful FOIA request can be appealed in accordance with the guidelines described in the Agency's Subpart F appeal and review procedure. An appeal should be submitted in writing within 30 days of the date that the FOIA officer denied the request. 6. What types of information does the Agency hold? The	0

HONORABLE MENTION Best New Series: "American Crime" What a season it's been for FX and "American Crime." The crime drama has been one of the most talked about new shows this fall, thanks in large part to its star power. "American Crime" is one of those shows that has captivated fans in a way that few other shows do. "American Crime" is based on the true story of the murder of 18-year-old Elizabeth Smart, who was kidnapped and held captive by a man she had met on a dating app. While many critics have deemed the show's depiction of the Smart family "unreal," the best part about the show isn't the characters or the storyline, it's the stellar cast. In just one of her many appearances on the series, Jennifer Lopez sang the title song from the show. Her amazing rendition of the track (and in her own words, she does some very impressive singing) was so popular that the singer received a standing ovation from the people in the audience. Not only did actress/singing sensation Lopez help raise money for the show, she also helped the show raise awareness from the community and the media. And Lopez wasn't the only star who contributed to the show's incredible success. RELATED: "American Crime" Showrunner Explains Season 1 Finale 'America's Got Talent' Star Casts 'American Crime' Voiceover Watch: Jennifer Lopez Performing 'American Crime' Song The show brought in plenty of fan support as well: "American Crime" has been nominated for multiple awards, including a Creative Arts Emmy, a SAG Award, a Drama Desk Award, and several SAG Award noms. In its first season, the show has been nominated for the Writers Guild of America Award and won two Emmy Awards and a Golden Globe Award. "American Crime" may take a hit in the ratings, but it is one of the best shows on TV. It's an emotional thriller that will keep you on the edge of your seat, and its cast (including Lopez. who has also earned two Emmy nominations, one of them for the series' performance) has done a bang up job of keeping everyone engaged.	0
A large number of people have been detained in the northern Sinai Peninsula following the arrest of 12 suspected Al-Qaeda members in a joint operation by the Egyptian Security Forces (EGF) and Egyptian Border Police. "The Egyptians have arrested 12 suspects accused of belonging to the so-called Islamic State (IS) movement in the Sinai peninsula, including one Brit and two Americans. They were arrested and transferred to the headquarters of EGF in Al-Arish," a statement by EGF revealed on Tuesday. The statement also stated that the 13 suspects accused of belonging to Al-Qaeda "were detained in collaboration with the General Intelligence's Counter-terrorism unit," and added that they were taken into custody on Sunday afternoon after an information-sharing agreement between the EGF and Egyptian intelligence agencies. On Monday, the EGF issued a statement announcing that the two American men, including an employee of the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), were detained along with the four other Americans from the UK and two Australians on Sunday. The group of Americans was also identified as: Ahmed Mohamed Abdullah, 29, of Colorado, Patrick Harrold, 35, of California, Khaled Abu Thurayeh, 29, a Jordanian national from Jeddah and Mohamed Ahmed Awwad, 23, an Egyptian citizen residing in Houston, Texas. EgyNews.sy also reported that the British man, Ahmed Mohamed, was one of the "British nationals" detained in addition to the four men. Meanwhile, El Watan newspaper reported in its Monday edition that the U.S. government is aware of the Egyptian government's efforts to capture members of the Islamic State (IS) militants that have been apprehended. The Egyptian counter-terrorism forces arrested 13 people suspected of belonging to the group Islamic State in Sinai (IS) when they raided their dens on Saturday night, on the outskirts of Sheikh Zuweid in Rafah town on the North of the North Sinai Peninsula. According to the newspaper, the arrests were made at the site of the operation carried out by Egyptian security forces from army engineers to apprehend the terrorists and rescue the people held hostage. The terrorist suspects were arrested while digging around the perimeter of the dens after a special military task force was sent down from the Karmel governorate to carry out the operation. Meanwhile, the British men, Ahmed Mohamed, Patrick Harrold, Khaled Abu Thurayeh and Mohamed Awwad, are alleged to have confessed to have been active in the extremist terrorist group in Sinai over several months by using internet conversations and videos. The newspaper further claimed that the captured terrorist suspects are linked to several Al-Qaeda affiliates and are planning to launch an attack in Sinai, targeting tourist resorts, including the one in Sharm el-Sheikh, the EgyNews.sy reported.	0
KIEV (Reuters) - A Ukrainian court on Monday threw out the appeal by Ukrainian opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko against her six-year jail term for abuse of power in a case brought by former President Viktor Yanukovich. Tymoshenko, 61, who now lives in Switzerland, asked the court to find that prosecutors had not presented enough evidence to convict her of the original charge, in which she was convicted on more than 40 counts, including abuse of power and fraud. But she also appealed for the acquittal of an additional 15 counts of abuse of power - mainly related to her 2007 decision against a gas discount scheme when she was energy minister. Those counts would still be in force. Tymoshenko's lawyer said prosecutors still had not provided any evidence proving the charges. The case, brought before a Ukraine appeals court in February this year, has attracted international attention, with diplomats and lawyers from Western powers arguing against her long term in jail. Tymoshenko has become a symbol of anti-government protests led by jailed Yanukovich loyalists in the fall of the country's pro-Russian president in February 2014. She has denied any wrongdoing. Oleksandr Turchynov, the new acting prime minister, said on Monday the court in Kiev did not find "any grounds" for Tymoshenko's appeal. "I consider her the queen of corruption and a criminal in the making," he told reporters in Kiev. A verdict will be announced later this year, he added. Slideshow (5 Images)	0
The government has taken some major steps to bring India's poor out of abject poverty. The country has succeeded in eliminating absolute poverty as a percentage of the population from 40.3 per cent as per the last count in 1996 to 13.1 per cent in 2015, according to the poverty line released by the National Sample Survey Office (NSSO) in January. India has become one of the fastest moving countries in the world when it comes to reducing absolute poverty. During the period between 1990 and 2014-15, its decline stood at 19.4 per cent and its share of the total world poverty reduction reached 2.8 percentage points. India's impressive success is partly because of a combination of economic reforms implemented over the last three decades, high tax collection in the state-run sectors and reforms in the policies of the central government. But if we look at the details, we can also find a reason for the India's economic growth. At the macro level, as I have already analysed in a detailed paper, economic growth is most likely to have resulted from the adoption of the policies of growth and liberalisation advocated by the government, rather than on the basis of the free fall in prices on account of excessive monetisation undertaken for the past two decades. The policy reforms implemented by the Indian government, including the financial liberalisation, the introduction of the Goods and Services Tax and the opening of the coal, petroleum and natural gas sectors to private players, reduced poverty in India from 49.1 per cent in 1991-92 to a much more reasonable 25.4 per cent in 2010. The liberalisation of the economy led to an enormous growth in manufacturing and an equally rapid growth in services. It is estimated that between 1990 and 2008, India's total factor productivity went up by a factor of 15. The number of jobs in manufacturing did not change from 576 million to 592 million, while 1.86 million jobs were added to those in manufacturing. The number of jobs in services, by contrast, increased from 706.1 million in 1990 to over 800 million in 2008. The Indian economy has achieved a high rate of productivity growth due to its high share of skilled workers in the workforce, as measured by the share of the skilled workforce in the overall labour force. This, in turn, has led to greater labour force participation, a larger proportion of workers in the non-agricultural sector and a higher share of low-skilled workers in the workforce. To a certain extent, labour market deregulation was the product of efforts by Rajiv Gandhi to attract foreign direct investment. But the policy of the government was ultimately a response to the labour demand that had grown as a result of the reforms. As a result, this growth in the labour force led to an increase in labour productivity, which in turn leads to an increase in labour force participation as well as higher growth. The labour demand that fuelled growth also fuelled the creation of new jobs in different sectors, particularly in manufacturing, services and construction. The impact of India's reforms on growth is also apparent in the labour productivity growth. As has been shown by a number of studies, these reforms were accompanied by a productivity growth of between 15 and 20 per cent, and the growth rates of both the total factor productivity and labour productivity increased significantly. As the labour growth became more inclusive, the growth in labour productivity and hence total factor productivity also became more inclusive. Overall, the policy reforms implemented by the Indian government during the last three decades and especially the financial sector reforms have played a huge role in transforming India into an economically advanced economy. And the economic growth has been largely due to the policy reforms initiated by Rajiv Gandhi. The question then is not of who benefited the most from growth; the question is how much the Indian economy has benefited from both the policies of growth and reforms, and to what extent did these reforms promote growth. There have been several studies on the impacts of the reforms in the agricultural sector, specifically on agricultural income share. It is evident that the reforms facilitated the conversion of agriculture into an agro-economy. Over the last four decades, the share of agriculture in the total value of India's GDP grew from 6.1 per cent in 1970-71 to about 29.5 per cent in 2005-06. In 2013-14, about 51 per cent of the total value of rural labour force was engaged in agriculture and this constituted almost 35 per cent of rural people's gross income. The impact of agricultural reforms In 2012-14, the average rural wage in India was about Rs 3,000 per month with a weekly earnings of about Rs 20,000 per day. The government estimated that in 2014-15, agricultural incomes amounted to almost a third of the total agriculture and forest income. In fact, most of the income from farmers comes from the sale of cereals. If the farmers had to sell this income to the market, they would be able to earn much less. On his part, Prime	0

The Department of Justice is investigating the Trump campaign's ties to Russia, and one of the topics being probed is payments that Russia made to a lawyer for a former Trump campaign foreign policy adviser named Carter Page. Fox News is reporting that the Justice Department is exploring the legality of the money. Page was also one of a few Trump advisers who spoke with Ambassador Sergey Kislyak during the 2016 presidential campaign. Read more	0
There are many factors to consider and many factors which need to be taken into account when choosing a car to lease or own, including: Mileage cost Monthly fees Fuel Economy: MPG versus Fuel Efficiency Payment method options and APR (Annual Percentage Rate) Interest rates and monthly payments What is a Lease? Leases come in two main forms: one-year and six-month renewals or leases. One-Year Leases A one-year lease has two phases - the early commitment phase which occurs when there isn't enough funds in the account to pay the entire balance when you take the car out for the first time and the final payment phase which takes place when you have all required funds in your account. Lease Duration : 5 years, 24 months @ $18.95 per month : 5 years, 24 months @ $18.95 per month Monthly Fees: $7 per month Lease payments are due upon signing the lease agreement. Lease Rate : 16.5% APR : 16.5% APR Payment Type: 14.75% variable or 25% pre-set monthly payment One Year Auto Leases One-year auto leases are also offered through multiple automotive finance companies. Typically, leases for vehicles between 18-34-months in length have a four-year term. Leasing cars for a few years is a good way to reduce the potential impact of depreciation and pay off your car sooner. Lease Duration : 4 years, 24 months @ $18.95 per month : 4 years, 24 months @ $18.95 per month Monthly Fees: $7 per month Lease payments are due upon signing the lease agreement. Lease Rate : 16.5% APR : 16.5% APR Payment Type: 14.75% variable or 25% pre-set monthly payment There are some exceptions to the one-year term lease rule - for example, in a situation where there's a large down payment or a substantial purchase price drop, you may have a lease that extends your time to own your car by up to 60 months. Lease Duration : 6 years, 24 months @ $18.95 per month : 6 years, 24 months @ $18.95 per month Monthly Fees: $10 per month Lease payments are due upon signing the lease agreement. Lease Rate : 30% APR : 30% APR Payment Type: 30% variable pre-set monthly payment Leasing is a great way for you to drive on long trips, or to do other errands and make car payments to the point where your car is truly in use while you're away. Six-Month Leases Leases for vehicles between 32-44-months in length have a five-year term. Leasing is a great place to rent when your car is older or for a long time, or to move, or to sell your car. Lease Duration : 5 years, 30 months @ $11.95 per month : 5 years, 30 months @ $11.95 per month Monthly Fees: $5.95 per month Lease payments are due upon signing the lease agreement. Lease Rate : 19% APR : 19% APR Payment Type: Fixed 10 months @ $27 per month Leasing can be more than one way to pay off your car. For example, you may choose to get out and sell your car to a customer with an agreement that includes a leasing amount, and the remaining balance of financing would be paid once you're moved or sold. Lease Duration : 5 years, 30 months @ $18.95 per month : 5 years, 30 months @ $18.95 per month Monthly Fees: $7 per month Lease payments are due upon signing the lease agreement. Lease Rate : 19% APR : 19% APR Payment Type: Fixed 10 months @ $27 per month There are also situations where you may be able to pay less up front for your car - such as when you know the exact price you'll be paying at sale. Lease Duration : 5 years, 30 months @ $18.95 per month : 5 years, 30 months @ $18.95 per month Monthly Fees: $7 per month Lease or Lease & Lease & Purchase If you're a student that does well in school, you might be able to work a lease arrangement with your school, and work out the final payment to ensure you pay off the full amount without having to purchase your car. Your school would usually be your lender, and you wouldn't have to put a lien against your car. Lease Duration : 6 years, 30 months @	0
A new campaign from the British Humanist Association is attempting to get a public debate around the issue, with a website offering advice on how people can get involved. The campaign will involve several online campaigns over the next month - such as 'Make Britain A Better Place For Atheists and The Non-Religious', which will target government and media with a call for action. The campaign's lead organiser, Andrew Copson, said: "We are now facing the first election in a generation where politics is being dominated by the Christian right and it is clear that public debate is very much a matter of when, not if. "This is why we need to fight for a secular country that is open for ideas from all sides and an inclusive one that works for everyone." The website includes links to online forums, such as atheist Facebook group Atheists of Britain (which has nearly 4,000 members), which can be used to join, promote, and help organise campaigns around the campaign.

If you're not satisfied with your work from day one, it's pretty hard to get motivated to do more – even if you already know how awesome you are. I've written before about why motivation is hard to replicate and how to build habits that stick (that you actually want to follow). But, I'll go further. Why Motivation is Hard to Build I learned this the hard way when I tried too hard to get motivated, rather than just being inspired. If you're feeling motivated, but you're really only inspired, you're going to fall short. This isn't necessarily wrong, or even especially rare in the first place, as I've worked with plenty of people who haven't always had the "motivation" part (although many have felt great about their work). This is how I learned to build habits – building in small daily wins that make you feel great right now rather than thinking about getting there later or getting someone else there. I've written before about how my habits (that can be pretty challenging, although I learned them by experience) have gotten much easier in part to that principle. The reason this "getting started" principle is important is because as you start to do more you need to know why you're motivated. You need to know what you love about working on the project. You need to know why you do it. And the best way to find that out is to get started. If you can build momentum, you don't even need to worry about motivation. You can be motivated with your work on the initial day. Just make sure you're motivated to do that initial day's work. Otherwise, it might come the next day and you'll regret your decision to get started then. If you'd like to see an example of how to start a habit and get started with minimal to no motivation – check out this article on setting up your first project. Why Motivation is Hard to Get Back If you're feeling motivated to do more, then it might come back or you'll try to do it more regularly. Even if you do it again, motivation won't necessarily be there at that point, so you'll do that again. This is why it's so crucial to have a consistent approach. Don't let yourself get into a rhythm where you start getting excited every time you do something. That doesn't work for long-term habits. If you need to be motivated to work on a project, schedule one thing every day (or even every hour) in a way that you're not motivated in that task, then you're likely just setting yourself up to fall into the trap of just doing the task every day. When setting up each task, I recommend making it about getting that one thing done so it's not about doing a task every day and not feeling motivated about it and not feeling motivated doing it. Focus on getting only the right thing done – the goal. How to Work on Habits When You're Not Motivated I often tell people that once you figure out what your main interests are, you can make a habit of following those. You should have a specific routine for your projects that you can do whenever you want to (without any pressure to actually follow through). Most people can't do a routine like this because many things we care about are too complex and can't fit into a routine that doesn't involve some kind of action. These are the kinds of things we can do to build habits that stick so you can make progress that doesn't feel impossible. These are the kinds of things I'd recommend you do. Focus on Getting Your First Thing Done Every Day The first step you need to develop habits and build confidence is to focus on getting your first work done every day (and on doing so consistently). This is a process I describe in my book, The Productivity Project. To do that, you need to follow a process that makes sense for you. This starts by defining your "big picture" goals (the things you want out of life), and then going about taking one action every day to get that first work done on those goals. For example, here are some examples to get you started: Identify your big picture goals (such as "build a better relationship with a friend I like" or "start doing more travel again"); Set a schedule on how often you'll do that action every day (instructions on how to follow these will come later); Set a small reward for yourself so you do it every day, such as a small accomplishment (such as checking your email for the first time in a while) to help you continue following through  There's a lot of potential here and lots of variations. What works for you is a matter of what makes sense for your own routine and what motivates you. Once	0
[Editorial Note: A recent poll showed that many Americans favor keeping current immigration policy. In order to better define the debate, I have created a special "Immigration Proclamations" page. These, and the immigration discussion more generally, have become an indispensible tool for students of history, immigration, and US policy. To add, comment, or ask questions, just scroll down and click that link!] The United States' current immigration system is complex. It is also confusing. And it is often forgotten that the issue of immigration is complicated. For example: It is hard for Americans to understand why it takes so long to get a green card. But when you consider that there is actually one "green card" per person, this can be understood in a simple way. Each person gets two green cards. Since the number of green cards per person is a matter of luck and not choice or need, if, say, only one person is ready to immigrate to the United States at a given time, we can state that this person can receive two green cards. But that means that someone can get an extra green card on top of his current one (or another person's) by "waiting", or by "working". What does that mean? And what did it mean when the "waiting period" ended in 1996? What is a "Waiting Period"? You can imagine it like this. Each person gets a waiting period. For example, let's suppose that no one ever gets an extra green card. The waiting period ends in 1996. Then someone can get an "extra" green card. (That would be a "green card" per person.) But there are three caveats to this simple explanation. First, the "waiting period" is just a theoretical period of four years. It is sometimes described as eight years after an immigrant gets his initial green card. Second, the waiting period can end earlier. The waiting period ended on September 12, 1999, when the US enacted a law to allow some illegal immigrants to obtain green cards by waiting. The third caveat is that in some cases, the waiting period did end earlier. In 1999, the legal immigration status of two categories — H-1B and L-1B — were changed to allow additional immigrants to stay in the United States while waiting. Some of those immigrants, called special immigrants, are now on waiting lists. And since the time of this writing, that list is about 100,000 people long. In addition, the process of the "green card lottery" is still under way — people apply for green cards at a rate of more than 200,000 per year. If you assume that each of those special immigrants was waiting for his green card to be issued in 1996, and that, of course, he did eventually receive one (assuming everyone else was waiting), his waiting period is now about a year — or a bit less if he is a first-time citizen. Why would a person "stay" a year or more in an illegal immigrant waiting list, if there is simply one waiting period? The answer can be found in a bit of history. Before the "green card lottery" When the country was first conceived, the idea of a nation-state was not the same as it is now. To begin with, there were multiple ethnic groups in the US. So there probably was an ethnic diversity that people could feel comfortable in. Thus there were ethnic groups within each ethnic group. This was an important reason for the decision that people "had the opportunity" to immigrate. They couldn't be kicked out for having an ethnic difference. Furthermore, the immigration policy of the country at that time was based on an idea that there were only a few groups who had a right to immigrate. For example, as early as 1596, King Charles I was worried about a new "native-born aristocracy" emerging in the country. In his opinion, the country wanted a diverse population, so it set laws to allow anyone to settle and live anywhere in England. But over time, these laws became outmoded or simply ignored. Most immigrants ended up settling in places where they could easily assimilate, such as Scotland, Wales, and the US colonies (such as Virginia). Thus when the country started to develop a national identity, the rules changed. In 1789, when America became a nation, it became possible for all immigrants, except those from the British West India islands, to come to the US. However, as it became clear that some foreigners could not become US citizens, they became illegal visitors. So, as we can see, before 1896 (some estimates have the change at 1691), there were people who "had the opportunity" to get a green card. But before 1896 (again, estimated at 1591), there were people who did not have the opportunity to get a	0
In a very large study published back in 2006 (in the Journal of Psychopharmacology), scientists found that the more recreational drugs users used, the more likely it was that they would get into serious trouble with the law. The researchers were actually surprised, as this was not something they had expected to find. However, what they found was quite startling: the more people used an illegal drug, the higher their chances of getting into jail. This could explain why in a world where cannabis is legal, the government has a higher percentage of cannabis consumers jailed or given jail sentences than in a world where marijuana and cannabis are still illegal, or in a world where marijuana is only available to anyone over 18 years of age. How did they determine the legal status of the drugs? They used an "experimental design", a method for validating the results of a study by a third party; they got people to answer questions about the legality of a drug and then tested their answers; if they got the question right (i.e., had answers that were correct when their actual answer was true), then they were given an experimenter's code that would then be shared publicly. Here are the top seven most legal and illegal drugs in the US: Heroin has been legal (and available) for use for many years, so the vast majority of people who use it do not get sent to jail. That said, it is certainly worth mentioning that the majority of heroin users are not using it recreationally, instead, they are simply using other more violent drugs like cocaine, PCP or crystal meth. DMT is legal, although you can be arrested for possession of the stuff. The main reason it is legal here is that the psychedelic experience is very intense. Some DMT users get hooked on this experience. While the majority of people find it more interesting than being in prison, it is still illegal to possess DMT or any other psychedelics in the US. I would imagine that most cocaine users will not find themselves going to prison either. Even in South America, which makes coca leaf cocaine a national drug, cocaine (as is usually sold) is legal, it is just not packaged in any particular way so to help get customers to buy it. A study published last month found that the use of LSD by college students is at an all time high, making it one of the most commonly used illicit drugs. The effects of marijuana are often used as a drug to create the illusion of being "high". That said, even if cannabis is considered "high", most people will be unaware that they are under the influence unless they start having extreme hallucinations. Methamphetamines, cocaine and methamphetamine are legal in the US, but are still highly addictive. A study from 2010 found in the U.S. that the number of young people who have abused prescription drugs like Vicodin, Xanax and Percocet has reached a four-year high. MDMA is a drug that is still classified as a Class A Controlled Substance, but it is an incredibly powerful stimulant. Because its actions are extremely similar to those of MDMA, users who abuse MDMA are sometimes considered to be "psychedelic". It is illegal in the U.S. DMT is still illegal, but it is still a drug that people use to trigger their "trance" trip. As a result, "trip" is frequently used as a synonym for "psychedelic," and DMT is sold in many places where illegal substances are sold -- places like head shops and headshops. If you think that MDMA is more common, you can check out a previous article (where I compared the effects of MDMA to those of LSD). Methamphetamine is an illegal drug sold as a dietary supplement and in various forms at the gas station. The most common form of meth is crystal methamphetamine which is more popular than "powder" meth. Although marijuana is not currently legal in the United States, you can buy weed in the US, it is just very hard to get. Cannabis is still illegal in nearly all states (it does not have much of a history of being legalized or decriminalized), but a number of states allow medicinal use of the plant: The most famous example are states like Arizona, California and Massachusetts which have decriminalized the possession of cannabis. Many of the things done with marijuana are done recreationally, and may become more serious in the future. Pot is certainly a drug; it could be classified under the umbrella of hard drugs like cocaine and heroin, but like most things, it is more complex than it first appears. Do you have a favourite drug? Are you a "user"? How many illegal drugs do you use? Would you use any of them in a "credible" setting with a "legitimate" therapist? Share this Article	0
Buddhist monks from India and Nepal hold their own funerals on the grounds of the Nalanda University in the Indian state of Bihar, India, in this May 31, 2017 file photo. REUTERS/Narendra Shrestha/Files By Rajesh Kumar Singh and Rishika Deva NEW DELHI (Reuters) - An unimpressed Indian court threw out a lawsuit on Wednesday filed by a man who claimed in 2014 he was kidnapped and held for three days in a dungeon-like building on a Buddhist monastery near the capital. The ruling is the latest in a series of legal defeats for a group of Indian monks that have been targeted by an ultra-nationalist Hindu group, which argues the monks have exploited their status to make money from people seeking spiritual enlightenment and chanting mantras. The lawsuit, filed in a western Indian city last year, said the Nalanda University in Bihar state, where the monks were based since the 1950s, was a "harsh prison in which religious liberty and moral dignity are violated." It alleges that two men with guns and chains kidnapped the man at gunpoint in September 2014 in protest at his refusal to repeat a mantra. They held him in a 10-meter long cell for several days in the Nalanda Teaching Hospital. Nalanda University, which is near the capital, was established by the Indian government on a mission to transform Buddhist beliefs to modern thinking, promoting scientific enquiry and fostering interfaith understanding. A judge dismissed the lawsuit, telling the court the men were not kidnappers and the monastery had no dungeon and was not a prison. "The plaintiff has not proved his allegations. It is also a clear case of extortions and extortion ... The plaintiff cannot prevail in his case," the court said. It ordered the case transferred to another district court for trial. The case will have to be heard again in about two months, when it will be heard on whether the Nalanda University is a museum or a research institution with a curriculum. (For a graphic on Indian monk prisons click tmsnrt.rs/2c4xVgT) Many Buddhist monasteries in India lack the modern facilities needed to treat patients or conduct research. The Nalanda University has no building, only a small part of a building used as a hospital in the capital Kolkata. In May 2016, an Indian court dismissed an anti-monk group's lawsuit which sought to stop a famous Nalanda monk from carrying out his work studying Buddhism in the northeast Indian state of Tripura.

Cats can be quite stubborn with their meals and are much more likely to resist food given to them than dogs. Here is a collection of some of the most interesting and unusual ways cats eat their food and how much it is likely to be in a typical daily meal. If you think the amount of protein might be too much your cat might just go for a small piece of dry dog, chicken or turkey with the bones and fat, you can have that for free to your cat, but just don't forget to feed them the whole food. In general, cats can eat much more than most people think and will happily take their portions just a little larger and with more vegetables. Cats will also take any food that looks like a bone as a bone if they don't eat it they simply toss it into a bin of food somewhere. A more unusual way cats eat is with a spoon. It is very common for them to eat their food with a spoon and you can try and encourage them to eat it like human children too by giving them a bowl of water. Try giving them a piece of water or a small piece of fruit. Cats will often eat by hand too and most people won't notice because of their large size and strong fingers. Foods that Cats Are Tasted After Eating Cats have a unique way of judging the quality of food they have enjoyed and will eat what they have not enjoyed as much. This is why you should try and be careful when cooking for your cat and only give a very small amount of food. Cats will not take a lot of food and you can feed them too much too fast and may just ruin something delicious for your cat. Catching the cat is a great way to catch them as a reward if they eat just a little. Cats are able to tell the difference between quality protein foods and cheap, poor quality food (a big difference between a chicken breast and a tuna fish at the supermarket for example), if they eat too much of the cheap, poor quality food they'll probably get sick and then you won't get food to feed them. Cats can also tell between quality meat and cheap meat, you can buy really cheap meat but you can also buy good quality meat in small cuts as they usually have a higher fat content. If you find the cat eating any of these food types, stop feeding them and try and get the cat to eat quality food. It can be a tough job to feed a cat good quality food because he doesn't have a lot of taste buds and if you can't get enough food for the cat's needs it can create a lot of frustration and can even result in them vomiting. Cats are much more likely to take the food they don't like and when this happens be patient and continue to feed them the quality food until it's gone. There is a risk cats can become so hungry that they eat their entire meal from the floor and if it's not a tasty meal to them there's a good chance they could die. If you want to do your best for the health and well-being of your cat and if this is to be achieved without killing the cat, you'll want to help them in the eating process by providing them with fresh, well balanced, high-energy meals and treats for them twice a day in order to provide a variety of nutrients which help them grow healthy and strong. Some cats will eat the food you give them without trying it but it is not normal, and they don't like to be told they're wrong and you can help them learn the difference by feeding them from time to time and showing them the variety that good quality food provides. It's also possible your cat can suffer from nutritional inadequacies and not eat the food they are supposed to. There are foods that are unsuitable for your cat if they are not kept under a correct diet, if your cat won't eat the food you have put in their bowl or if they have eaten it and suddenly become unwell. So remember, you can't feed the food you have made as they aren't able to digest the food, it would be extremely difficult and time-consuming making up these meals and then trying to feed them to your cat, just try not to mix too much and feed your cat a mixture of good quality meat and very thin cuts of healthy meat as this is a more healthy way to feed cats.	0

The world of mobile gaming is full of surprises, and the latest comes in the form of Microsoft's latest hardware. The Windows 10 Mobile version of Xbox One, revealed today, has been in the works for a while, and it's a significant improvement over the existing Xbox One S. "We've taken the same basic principles [of its Windows 10 counterpart], but added in a couple of key innovations," Xbox head Phil Spencer told PCWorld in an interview. "One of them, the Kinect, really takes a lot of the power from the console to create content and really personalize what you're playing. We've also brought in a new processor, which is a much faster system. [ See Also: Xbox One X Review: The Most Important Windows 10 Update of Our Lives | GameSpot's Xbox One X Review | Xbox One vs. PlayStation 4: The Best Graphics Game on Windows] "We did all of that to enable us, again, to really focus on creating a great experience in mobile." With a processor that's three times faster than the Xbox One S's, Microsoft's mobile strategy looks strong. The new Xbox, which debuted at E3 this year, was built to run "beyond Xbox." This hardware includes both the Windows 10 operating system as well as DirectX 12, Microsoft's upcoming, game-development-ready graphics API. With more power comes more processing speed. Windows 10 Mobile, for the first time, will enable a 4K game for Xbox One, using the same Xbox One X rendering software. Spencer called this "the first time we've come close to 4K on an Xbox." Spencer also compared the Xbox to the Xbox One S, which has a 4K display, and said Microsoft's new console is "overkill" compared to the standard console for gaming. "This is the first time we've come close to 4K on an Xbox!" Spencer said. "Because when you're using the standard Xbox One, that's not a good experience. It's not fast enough; it doesn't have 4K support. And that's why when you look in the games catalog, there are only a few titles in 4K now. The majority of the games in the catalog are upscaled, 1080p [high-definition]." Spencer also emphasized that the Xbox One S is designed as a low-end device, aimed at enthusiasts. "The console is the lowest priced product we've ever released," he said. "So, we had to work hard to make sure that you can purchase a good 4K display, a very good gaming console at $249 or less, and still have a good experience." Microsoft has a new Xbox One X next month, which features a 6.2-inch, 2,000-dot LCD screen and a GPU that can hit 1.86 teraflops. The console will launch with a software version of Fallout 4 and will be announced during an E3 press event later this month. While Microsoft is focused on creating a solid mobile console, it doesn't appear that the Xbox division is slowing down. Spencer called it "the biggest gaming business" in the world, and said Microsoft will continue developing games for all types of devices and all price points. "There is no such thing as too much technology," he said. "When we design new hardware, what we try to do is take the best attributes of the things we've done in the past and take those forward." Microsoft is already working on its first Windows 10 games for mobile devices. Microsoft Game Studios senior vice president Yusuf Mehdi said the company is working on "some pretty cool exclusive" mobile-focused titles later this year. He wouldn't name many titles, but said they would "explore unique and new ways the company makes games." Microsoft is no stranger to mobile, either. The company was one of the original early adopters of smartphones and tablets. Its first mobile device, the Nokia N8, launched in June 2010 as an upgrade of its Windows Phone platform. But the Nokia N8 didn't sell well, and Microsoft's smartphone ambitions never really took off. Instead, Microsoft began focused on its new Windows 10 operating system. More recently, the company has become more focused on mobile. The company announced a number of Windows 10 mobile announcements at the beginning of this year. This story has been updated.	0
In the world of finance, everyone looks for the shortcut to the promised land. I'm not here to tell you you have to follow a certain playbook to become a millionaire. You have a vast array of possibilities, and the road to riches is paved with great discoveries and hard work. But I do think some strategies might serve some folks better. In today's article we're going to share five strategy I prefer to keep in mind while pursuing a goal. For example, I prefer to focus my energy on building my personal brand because it's been proven to have a positive impact on how successful I am in every field of my career. In other words, if I want to be a millionaire, I should be building a personal brand that makes me stand out from the rest. The 5 Strategies 1. Focus on the Right Thing at the Right Time The first step to becoming a millionaire is making some smart moves when you need someone else to help you. The other part of this equation is timing. Make sure that when you make your best bets to achieve your goals, you're not setting yourself up for failure. By investing in those little things that are crucial to your personal development, you have all the advantages you need. For example, when I think about the most important skill to learn for success in my career, I realize that I need to build social intelligence. Once you understand that the most lucrative job opportunities are going to come from people with the right personality, you can make smarter decisions. 2. Start with Small Steps The big, flashy companies are the ones who are able to capitalize on the latest trends and fads. This is why people look for a shortcut in finding success by focusing on the things they have the biggest advantage over. Here's a real-world example: One of my most successful clients was a small company that sold online training. In order to make it to the next level, the company needed to build a strong base of online customers. However, they didn't know where to begin with this initiative. The clients they were turning to online weren't even as advanced as they were at their current jobs. I asked them to start small, by helping new clients build their online presence. And within a year, they did. 3. Work Smartly, but Work Hard People love to say that they're going to be more productive if they only work when they're working hard. But that's not a good way to think about doing something. The more you spend time procrastinating, the less effective you are. If you want to see an immediate change, ask yourself why you're procrastinating. I'd bet most of your reasons lie in your fear of failure. If you want to do something, you need to do it. If you just sit around waiting for some kind of magical shortcut that always works, you're going to be pretty unhappy. 4. Get to the Root of the Problem Sometimes people focus on the obvious problems that need to be fixed. But people also do a lot of things differently when they want to achieve something interesting rather than a simple result. This means that if you don't focus on problems and fix them, it's going to take longer to see any improvement in your ability. By tackling the problems that cause your fears and insecurities, you'll find ways to actually achieve your goals. 5. Make It a Habit I know why this gets the most press – it's true. If you don't start doing this every day, it takes forever to work things into your system. But over the long run, these small actions create the results you want so much. My personal system is based on 5 simple actions: 1. Get 1,000 people to do something as simple as taking 5 minutes of time during their breaks 2. Get the team to do the same on a regular basis to build habits and momentum 3. Take the daily walk 4. Set 3 goals for the day 5. Make a commitment to do something each night for a week with a friend or family member Make a commitment to doing something each night for a week with a friend or family member When you make a commitment to actually do something each night (and remember to do something every single night when you get a chance), what do you have to lose by taking the action? That's how you're going to get rich and stay rich. I used to be the lazy type. Like most people, I was not willing to work on becoming a millionaire. Eventually, the pressure built too much, and I knew I was ready to make that move as soon as I started working on my goals. Now, as a millionaire, I can tell you that once your priorities match the things that matter to you in life, you'll find success	0
The FBI today announced arrests on charges in the United States of five individuals accused of attempting to detonate bombs in New York City and New Jersey using homemade remote devices rigged to blow up airplanes while the planes were in the air. Two additional individuals are under investigation, according to the FBI. "As alleged, the defendants devised and executed what the FBI believes were two terrorist plots to commit terrorism against civilian aircraft to cause mass casualties in the United States," said Special Agent in Charge Andrew W. Vale of the FBI's Newark Field Office. "These plots, which were conceived and carried out in the United States, were both intended to kill large numbers of innocent people, including New Yorkers and New Jerseyans, and were also aimed at generating media attention. The plotters believed that these efforts would garner media attention, which would allow them to gain attention and be praised by the press," he said. "Our resolve and vigilance remain steadfast, and we will not rest until the terrorists have no place to hide, and are removed from the face of the earth." The charges, filed today in New Jersey, allege that the defendants sought to detonate three crudely made device placed on a flight to Newark International Airport and one on a plane that departed from Newark. According to the indictment, the three alleged bombs were to be concealed in the body cavities or in the rectums of the defendants. The bomb used in the plot was to explode once the aircraft was airborne and that it would explode in the same manner as a shoe bomb detonated by an accomplice. One of the defendants allegedly provided the explosives used to build the bombs to the alleged accomplice. "These defendants were indicted not because they were a threat to our nation, but because they were determined to kill as many people as possible. We will not tolerate any effort by criminals to use any means possible to hurt our citizens or our international allies in pursuit of their sinister goals, and this indictment speaks to the serious nature of these charges and the harm the defendants attempted to inflict," said United States Attorney Paul J. Fishman of the District of New Jersey and Acting Special Agent in Charge David L. Bowdich, FBI Newark Field Office. "The terrorists planned not only to kill, but to cause mass casualties and the destruction of property in the United States," said Fishman. "The charges filed today describe a plan that was conceived, developed and carried out across a span of two years. It was a multifaceted enterprise, conducted over a number of months by a diverse group of individuals, in coordination with individuals at several levels within the terrorist organization. Although the defendants had prior contacts in the Middle East and were previously charged with committing this plot, their alleged planning and collaboration, not only for the alleged flight plot, but the subsequent plot to target commercial aviation, is unprecedented. The case demonstrates the resolve of our federal, state and local law enforcement partners in combating terrorism. We'll do whatever we can to protect the public," the FBI Acting National Security Branch Director Richard Thornton said. "These individuals not only want to kill as many innocent people as possible and kill a lot of people in the process, but they believed it would be highly effective in bringing attention to this horrific act through media coverage," said Assistant United States Attorney Michael D. Williams of District of New Jersey. "This plot, which was so intricate, was designed to kill as many people as possible in a short period of time. It has been alleged that the defendants had previous contacts in the Middle East, so it is possible that they were trying to recruit new terrorist recruits from there. These charges will help us keep the public fully and informed regarding potential threats and help us focus on stopping the real dangerous terrorists – those that attack our country on home soil." The defendants each face a maximum sentence of life in prison if convicted on all counts. Additional defendants are still being sought and are expected to face formal charges. The men and women allegedly involved in the two alleged plots are alleged to be affiliated with al-Qa'ida in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), according to the indictment. Today's arrests are part of an ongoing counterterrorism investigation. Additional arrests are anticipated, and further information is being gathered concerning the alleged plot in connection with this ongoing investigation. The Department of Justice is committed to working with its law enforcement partners around the world to identify, disrupt and to bring to justice those that seek to harm Americans. If you wish to speak with an attorney who may be able to represent you, you may call (800) 909-CLUB (2258). An attorney may also be reached at the FBI's Newark Field Office at (609) 537-5016. If you reside in New Jersey, please call the Newark Field Office at (609) 537-1222, option 3, to obtain the most up-to-date information regarding your case.	0
The man accused of driving his SUV into protesters and breaking his thumb trying to prevent them from shutting down a Minnesota interstate says protesters are "a bunch of stupid bitches" whose main purpose is "to get a reaction." Lori Woodworth, the driver who is also accused of causing a minor crash to get away, made nearly 100 miles on a single charge when a jury found him not guilty of two counts of first-degree criminal vehicular assault, which carry prison sentences of 15 years and 5 years, respectively, according to court records. Woodworth, 52, was released on $10,000 bail. Woodworth told the judge at an April trial that he'd been inspired by protests against police brutality in the St. Paul area, when police fatally shot Philando Castile in Falcon Heights. At the time, Woodworth told Star Tribune reporter Michael Bauer that police were using excessive force, and that if he had to go out in the street again, he would try to use his car instead. But the judge dismissed those claims, citing testimony from police that Woodworth intentionally drove into people protesting the police shootings of Philando Castile and Alton Sterling in Falcon Heights, as law enforcement across the country are under increasing scrutiny for their actions. During the trial, Woodworth told the court, "I'm an emotional person," and he was upset over the police department's use of force at the protests. But he claimed to have been acting in self-defense, as he'd hit a protester in the face and had to pull his car in front of the protesters until they let people on the interstate. He told Bauer a bit later that "there were people on the side of the highway that were just blocking the flow, and I had to put them in my path and get them off." Prosecutors argued that Woodworth was intent on hurting people, so the incident calls for a much stiffer penalty than just reckless endangerment. Prosecutors said Woodworth intentionally drove off the roadway and into the protesters, injuring several and causing a crash that sent two drivers who were sitting in Woodworth's car to the hospital. An officer testified that after the crash, Woodworth admitted to him "he was mad because he wanted to kick people, but he was also afraid they would hit him, so he sped up and slammed into them," according to evidence offered at trial. Prosecutors said at least two people were thrown into the air, and at least one person was hospitalized. An attorney for demonstrators told Bauer that most of the people who were injured in Woodworth's drive-by were "uneducated citizens who don't know better," and that "it's very frustrating that they were injured."	0
The first time someone suggested that the Federal Reserve should buy a certain bond had to do in large part with oil. This was in January of 2011, during the debate over raising the debt ceiling. At a time when the economy was shrinking, Republicans, led by Sen. Jim DeMint (R-SC), were arguing that the debt ceiling was no longer an effective way to cut deficit spending. In the debate, DeMint advocated for the Fed to buy a bond from companies that were having difficulty borrowing at cheap rates and selling them a cheaper bonds to repay their debts. At the time, I think Republicans were right to be concerned that the debt ceiling made it difficult to cut spending. At the same time, I thought it would be impossible for the Fed to purchase a long-term bond and buy a short-term bond at the same time. The debt ceiling was in place because, back then, deficits were high and no one thought the debt ceiling would be increased. If the ceiling had been raised at that time, the government would have been able to borrow more without increasing its deficit. That's because Congress in the early nineteen-sixties was unwilling to raise new revenue to pay for the new military spending. The government could only borrow money to buy the old military, not the new. Fast forward to today, when the long-term deficit is at 1.1 percent of gross domestic product. As the economy continues to grow, we're not likely to increase the deficit, which means the interest rate on long-term government bonds falls. The Fed buys long-term bonds, and so to buy long-term bonds the Fed buys longer-term bonds — which means that the Fed purchases longer-term bonds from companies at a lower interest rate. That may sound complicated, but it simply means that the Fed buys the new bonds from companies at an interest rate lower than the interest rate it receives for its old military bonds. And in a healthy economy, prices adjust quickly. If we get a healthy economy, the Fed has no reason to worry about holding long-term bonds. If we don't, though, this could cause trouble. This is a complicated answer, but I hope it clarifies my point. Advertisement — Kevin D. Williamson is roving correspondent for National Review.	0
When it comes to the subject of religion, I often find myself on the wrong side of the argument. My friends, family, and co-workers often seem to share my views and I find myself at odds with them on certain key subjects. So it's hard not to be somewhat cynical when it comes to the recent kerfuffle about a new app dubbed "Buddhify." The app is apparently designed to convert non-believers, and even those who claim to be strong atheists, into Buddhist followers. It is supposed to give users tools to increase their spiritual practice and to share their own experiences. So, if anyone was trying to get atheists to convert, this app, as its name implies, will likely be pretty effective. The app's developers, two brothers from Vancouver, Canada, took to Kickstarter for funding the creation of "Buddhify" after making an extensive study of the topic. Their Kickstarter pitch specifically mentioned the app, saying that it aims to "help you understand Buddhism, get to know other Buddhists, and learn how to cultivate deeper connection" while sharing their "personal experience with the path." They started off with the concept of teaching mindfulness to Buddhists by having Buddhists sign a contract promising to practice mindfulness for 60 minutes at a time, as well as to give a talk on mindfulness to a Buddhist group. It is also possible to choose to give a personal talk on Buddhism to a person of any faith, and their talk is supposed to be done "in a friendly and non-judgemental atmosphere and in a public place." What made this app different wasn't so much the idea itself as how it was built. The app includes a series of meditation practice guides, guided meditations, as well as a mindfulness section called the "Mindfulness Zone." In it, the website's creators explain that users "will find content on mental meditation, and you can also choose to get mindfulness training directly from your favorite Buddhist teacher. If you're looking for more spiritual inspiration, we're adding over 100 additional meditation techniques." These included "Buddhism Meditation," "Mindfulness Meditation," "Self-Compassion Meditation," "Meditation for a Happier Life," and "Meditation for Fulfillment." The website also has a section entitled "Suffering: A Buddhist Perspective." This section includes two short videos titled "Buddhism: the Problem" and "How Buddhism Helped Change My Life," with descriptions of the topics. The campaign has not yet had an amazing launch, only raising over $5,000, though it has raised enough support so far. So it seems likely that this isn't the last we'll see of this kind of product… or at least not for a little while. While the app itself is designed to be free, their original idea might not hold up to the scrutiny of secular humanists. To be honest, I would be a little wary if such a company tried to sell me on the idea that meditation is just as good as prayer, or even better. And, again, that could be just me reading into this too much. The App itself does not offer meditation training, nor any other aspect of any form of spiritual practice. It is simply meant to share the experience of someone practicing meditation to the world as a kind of "experiment." In other words, its goal is to try to get people interested in meditation in order to use Buddhism as an example to help others practice. In other words, they're trying to do something that has never been attempted before… and in doing something that has never been tried before, are trying to make Buddhism seem good. If mindfulness is truly the main goal behind this app, then it will likely fail at just about everything it sets out to do. First, if mindfulness is the solution to the problem of suffering, then that means it actually causes suffering to the people who practice it. A "relatively short 60 minute meditation" is not going to make a great contribution to someone's life. Second, those who participate in this app will not actually be practicing anything. They don't really have anything to do outside of the meditation sessions so they don't really have any "training" to share. Most importantly, this app is being marketed as an "experiment." As such, it is being sold as an experiment. It is an experiment in how far one would go to try to find an "effect." What if one doesn't have to pray to get better, or meditate to make yourself happier… what if one can just get better by meditating? Of course, the reality is that meditation is a pretty good way to make yourself happier. It helps with everything from stress, to chronic pain, to social anxiety, to insomnia. In the long run it can actually make you a lot happier than going to the gym. Of course, the reality is that meditation is a pretty good	0

In his own words, "The Lord has created the human body for the use and benefit of living things…The body, or its parts, are to be used for food and clothing for their own sake, but not in excess to the point where it creates an unhealthy or impure diet…" (Teachings of Presidents of the Church: Spencer W. Kimball, p. 621) It wasn't until my mother was in her last year of medical school when the revelation, "Behold, I reveal unto you these things, for inasmuch as ye do these things, the gates of hell shall not prevail against you" was first published in print. In January of 1979, the first revelation was published in the Ensign. On May 5th, the second revelation was published in the Priesthood Bulletin and the following month was put on the reading list—in addition to the first revelations. In 1978, the revelation was published in the Priesthood Ensign. From 1978 until 1987 the Book of Mormon was published monthly in the Church News. In 1982, 1978, when the Book of Mormon was published, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints was in its 19th year—and on March 2, 1982 the first revelation was published in the Ensign. Then we received our own translation of the Book of Mormon as an article in the Church News. In 1972, 1978, when the revelation was published in the Ensign, The Second Presidency had been reduced from 6 men to 4 men, and the First Presidency was reduced from 3 men to 2 men. In 1981, the first revelation had been published in the Ensign. In 1982, the second revelation was published in the Priesthood Bulletin. And in 1983, the revelation was published in the Doctrine and Covenants. The only change in the way the revelation had been published during these years was the name of a person who had been named as a counselor in the First Presidency. (Although not included in the first revelation, he had served as President of the Seventies from 1966 to 1969.) When it was published in 1977, he was named president of the Seventies. At that time he was President of the Seventies, but did not preside over any general conference meetings. When the revelation was finally published in the Ensign in 1978, President Gordon B. Hinckley was a counselor in the First Presidency but President of the Seventies. (At that time it was the Presiding Bishopric which was acting as quorum of the Twelve.) In the meantime, all things had been "translocated" from the heavens to Earth and then to the earth. Many of the changes in our daily lives were made from heaven to earth after the Church as we know it today was organized. There have always been a series of revelations to give direction on all things and to keep the Lord and the Church moving forward. The second revelation, published in the Priesthood Bulletin on May 5, 1982, was published with the following commentary and was titled "A New Vision of the Divine Plan of Salvation"—with a short comment in the Ensign that said, "A new vision of the divine plan of salvation was given" (see Teachings of Presidents of the Church: Gordon B. Hinckley, pp. 531). It is, therefore, easy to see how it was that on May 20, 1982 the "new vision" was revealed (see Ensign, May 20, 1982, p. 56). I was 13 years old when this revelation was revealed in The Ensign—and I know that this was the first time it was published since the revelation was first revealed in 1978, in January of 1979. In addition, it should be noted that some of us had a little difficulty with the new vision for a week—in 1983. It was like something out of the "Mormon Moment" in which some Mormons took to the streets of Salt Lake City, chanting in unison and singing songs to give the feeling of coming "to the real Church," and making "a great statement." In our personal life this was a little awkward, but we stuck to our commitment to this vision and it was not revealed again. When the revelation was announced for public release on May 5, 1981, we all knew this was a truly magnificent and uplifting revelation that was going to lift the hearts and minds of all those who read it and who knew of its impending publication. It was also announced and it was proclaimed and it was shared—it was proclaimed in the Church News! The Ensign and the Priesthood Bulletin used the same typeface and the same cover and used same type language. In the Priesthood Bulletin, on May 15, 1981, we were informed, The Lord has given us a new vision of the divine plan of salvation. The divine plan of salvation for all things that have existed or will exist or be created in the future, including our mortal bodies	0
"The reason the Democrats are losing is they are so divorced from the real world. So arrogant and out of touch with the vast middle of the American people that they think this is a reasonable solution to their problem. But it's not. It's a self-inflicted crisis. And if they want to fix it, it has to be a big political solution. "If they want to fix the problems of the last few years, the first thing they need to do is get off their self-inflicted high horse and get back down in the middle class. The middle class can't afford to keep going to the polls year after year to elect people who have no clue what they're doing. If the Democrats had their way, they wouldn't have had the recession at all. The Obama-Clinton economic policies have not worked for the middle class. It hasn't produced higher wages, has not created jobs, has not brought back the jobs we lost and has simply shifted the problem to the other party. "If you actually look at the facts, that you can't do what you say you're going to do. The economy is far better off than it was in 2007 when President Bush took office and that's true of almost every developed country. "You can't keep on giving every kid a free college education even while the cost goes from 8% to 20%. The American people are not fooled because they see that it's a sham and that we have to do something about it. It's not just that we had a good economy before it was great again. The Republicans got the wind down. "They were caught flatfooted. Their plans worked because the Democrats made the American people pay for them. The Democrats promised every American on the dole they could keep the same Social Security they had and then made it impossible for them to keep it. They took all the money that was available under the old system and redistributed it amongst themselves through the income tax and cut into the benefits from the old system. "When they took away people's healthcare and cut it off for younger people, I said, 'How can you be cutting it off?' "Because when they went back through and started looking at the American people they had no idea what they were doing. "They said they had a mandate and the American people didn't believe them. And now we know why. They had no mandate at the ballot box. But they wanted to pretend that they had one. They needed a mandate. This is how they got one. This, in the end, is what they care about. They just don't have the courage to show you. "It wasn't because Americans are stupid. It wasn't because they're stupid. It wasn't because the media is stupid. It wasn't because they're uneducated. It wasn't because they couldn't learn to do what is asked of them. It was because they cared. Because they care and they didn't know it."	0
In a recent editorial, the Financial Times has claimed that all of the "big global financial institutions", including Deutsche Bank, are more or less safe despite the recent wave of bank scandals and the collapse of one country after another. However, that editorial ignores the fact that the banking industry is still in the midst of a major crisis in which the entire system can get toppled at any moment, and the global financial markets are becoming ever more interconnected. The global crisis started when one bank, Lehman Brothers, crashed in 2008, bringing down with it the US economy and the global financial system. When the crisis hit, Deutsche Bank was one of the major banks involved, as its assets exceeded $500B (at the time). Despite the fact that the financial crisis was eventually contained, it was not soon over, as the global economy and the financial system still are currently in bad shape. In an effort to get back past the crisis, the banking industry has been trying various ways to create more and more bank and financial businesses, including some big companies. In the case of Deutsche Bank, it is trying to create a "Quantitative Investment Bank," which sounds more interesting than it is. The Financial Times notes that Deutsche Bank is creating a fund, but at least it seems to be a good idea and is the right way to solve the problem. As we have said in the past, the key problem is not necessarily the creation of a quantitative investment bank, but rather an overreliance on credit, which is a very dangerous and inefficient asset. Furthermore, the Financial Times claims that "the bank will seek to raise as much as €6.2 billion through a bond issue" to help resolve problems in "riskier business units," so all seems to be going well at Deutsche Bank, except for one important aspect… This all seems so good, but if you think about it, what it really means is that not only the global financial crisis is just starting, but global credit is just about to turn into a completely different asset from what it was. The last debt bubble was created in the "financial crisis" of 2008, which led to the largest loss of wealth in the history of finance. The asset bubble which was built on that debt has now completely burst, and the banking industry is struggling to deal with the situation on many different levels, including the loss of billions of dollars of customers' money. Since then, the US economy has been trying to avoid a recession by keeping interest rates incredibly low. While this may end up saving Deutsche Bank, the real problem is that the whole world economy is looking at the same problem. In the past, global credit was based on real production, which was more than enough for the economy to thrive. However, now many of the economies are in the middle of a crisis, so global credit is becoming ever more precarious. Because of this, the asset bubble which was built on that debt is already bursting. This means that more and more financial assets that were made on that inflated credit, including credit default swaps (CDS), will be worthless if there is a major crash on the horizon. A big problem that is being ignored by the global market and global banking industry is that the US economy is still not yet in a recession, as it is not showing any indications of one at the moment. However, if the global financial crisis had actually started on October 30, 2008, but had never ended, then the situation today would have been very different. In addition, US banks, especially the "too big to fail" ones, have been trying to raise capital for some time now to stabilize their financial situation. We already know that the major banks are still far away from making any additional money from the interest they are paying, and no banks have the courage to risk their assets to create more credit, so they are all struggling to generate any real profit to help their financial solvency. What will really turn all of this around? If the world economy actually goes into recession, the banking industry will be going through a period of much turmoil as it will experience a "depletion crisis", as more and more of their business will be lost as customers will stop paying. The banking industry will struggle to keep up with the high demand for credit, as most banks will be experiencing the effects of lower cash flow.	0

Ahead of the World Cup in Brazil, an analysis of the most influential players and coaches in the national team's history have revealed the best players by age at each country. The analysis also considered the age where they first made their debut for that country - and why the average age has risen over the years. The analysis was conducted using data from FIFA's most-decorated and most-feared players, and world and European Championship winners who won the most national team trophies. There is one big caveat to all these 'best age' rankings. They are based on the best team-mates they have ever had, not in terms of talent, but simply on who they would have had on the pitch at a given time. That's not to say that the list of players below might not surprise some fans of the competition. For example, Germany has been an increasingly surprising force in recent years. Germany's youngest ever player as an international was 19-year-old Alexander Hleti in a friendly against Belgium in 1972. They have gone on to be the world's number one ranked teams since then - not an auspicious start for the next generation of German players. On average, the average age of the world's most influential player or coach is now just over 39. A few more quick things to ponder: Germany is the third biggest nation overall in terms of population, although at just over 65 million, their football team does pretty well by the size of their country. The most successful nations in terms of the total number of national team players per year are, unsurprisingly, the most populous countries in the world. A total of 16 countries have produced or inspired the likes of Romelu Lukaku, Diego Costa and James Rodriguez to become world-class footballers. The most successful nations, at playing a full season, have produced an average of 8.5 national team players - and that number seems about right. Nigeria is the top country internationally for the number of national team coaches who have gone into management since the end of the World Cup. The average age of coaches of the World Cup winners currently under retirement is 58 years, seven months. The most influential player by country There is one key fact that stands out over the most influential players of all time, and it's the age at which they started their international career - which in the case of Brazil's stars has increased over the last 10 years. The average age at which Brazilians won their first major tournament is now just over 38, two years younger than the World Cup winners of 2005, but the next highest average age at this juncture is Spain at 36, while the U.S. are currently the fastest at winning the tournament. In terms of the most important year for any team, 2011 has seen the biggest surge in player and coach ages at the top. This is not so much an indication of a changing of the guard in terms of performance, but that the new generation of Brazilians is just arriving. For the other nations' respective national teams, there is a huge gap between the most influential players and most influential coaches of the most recent World Cup winners - with the difference being mostly due to the different ages in recent tournaments. England, for example, have had two coaches who have been leading the national side for over a decade - since the 1998 World Cup. That means England went through an international coaching boom from 1999-2008 - with eight major tournaments under the guidance of the England manager. Their most influential player on average will be 32-year-old Steve McClaren - while their most influential coach is 38-year-old Guus Hiddink - with the Dutchman the current coach of Euro 2012-winning manager Louis van Gaal, and not only the manager for the Netherlands. If England were to win that tournament they could expect to lose their best players - but they can already draw on some impressive internationals to guide the youngsters into the team. Germany, however, have had a different managerial story. Their top most influential player, at least at the current age, is 34-year-old Joachim Low. He has overseen a major change in Germany's fortunes over the last two decades. Their most influential coach is 35-year-old Joachim Loew, yet he doesn't have any significant experience at the international level. The most influential players overall There are a few other interesting facts to consider. Of the 17 teams who have ever won more than one World Cup, Argentina are the only team to win all 10. The next highest is the United States, with six, although they have only ever won it once. Of the 12 nations to win all 10 World Cups, 13 saw a rise in the average age of international players from the previous tournament. The only countries which managed not to rise in	0

The last couple of months have seen the emergence of a new genre of film: documentary-style biopics. The goal is simple: to tell more about someone — often about their life after death. The most popular films are typically based on a single subject, like the 2005 film "A Very Long Engagement," (which was directed by George Clooney), or the 2012 "Man on Wire," which was directed by and starring Bradley Cooper. The "Death of Muhammad" film from the Middle East doesn't qualify as a film, but it is a biography, following the life of Muhammad Ali Jr. It may have been directed by Steven Spielberg and based on an old book — I am not certain, but it should be on your "Things That Are Very Important to America" list for next year's birthdays. The film, which has been on life support in a Brooklyn movie theater for months and is due out in 2014, has not been seen by anyone outside its own production team (the director is a longtime Spielberg collaborator) and is expected to end production at some point in November. As the number of movies geared at biopics is steadily increasing, the question is whether these movies can still be made. How does a filmmaker get a documentary feel right, while at the same time avoiding the problem of too much research, not having enough time to shoot and then having to pull the plug after six months? Filmmaker/co-director/writer David Lynch recently told the Guardian that he still makes biopics even though he has no interest in pursuing the format anymore. He said that the most expensive biopics in the past decade cost several million dollars and take up to five years to make. "If you look at it as film as a medium, if I'm going to go into my garage, put a lightbulb on and make a film, I want that film to look like an old film. I'm not interested in making one that looks like a DVD," he told the Guardian. He added that he made his last 10 films for about $500,000 in terms of production costs. The movie "Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me" followed David Lynch during a four-month period in 1993, which included the original series finale and two more additional features. It starred Kyle MacLachlan, David Lynch, Jeffries, Fonda, James Remar, Ronette Pulaski, and Robert Forster and was shot in only 10 days. At this point, it's worth noting that the film was so expensive that Lynch didn't get paid until all 13 hours had been shot — his first film was originally scheduled to be made in two weeks. Although "Twin Peaks" is regarded as one of the greatest television series ever produced, there are rumors that its filming was difficult and that it took more than five years of production before the movie came to fruition. A film, even a big budget one, would require much more time and resources than that, especially for such a highly stylized series, but there's no denying that a lot of film and television work is in the pipeline, with several upcoming projects already in the works.	0

"I love my job, it's great. It's a fun job, the people that are involved in it all seem to love it." These are the type of words that come to mind after a quick read through the comments section of Reddit, where, in the last five days, the site has seen the birth of hundreds of 'Cameron Babies', after the former head of online and social media at Google's UK arm posted that she would be leaving her role. Her departure comes after the site saw one of its longest Reddit comment threads (more than 6,500 in all - almost 1,000 on a good day) in its history, a discussion on Google Glass. The response, which started with a single comment from a Google employee: "So, is this the kind of place to work?" was so far-reaching (the thread was the 11th most upvoted in the last week) that Google began to encourage members to submit their own comments, and in the final week, a total of 6,501 different threads were posted. The amount of comments to the end of the thread was almost as high as its length. Reddit is a 'democracy' of sorts, and the site allows users to nominate a certain number of 'AMA' (ask me anything) questions. Those who post AMA's (about 50 so far) often respond to questions they have answered in them. The ones, however, that do, are often more than just answers, with a high proportion of those being 'praise' for their employer, or the company that employed them, as they are known on the site. It isn't an exact science, of course, and some companies have been criticised for posting too many AMA's in a row, for example, and others have been happy with the questions that they have answered. There have even been a few 'cute' questions that have gained quite an appreciative response, with 'liking' and 'retweeting' becoming so popular that these comments are seen as a reliable benchmark from which a company can judge how quickly it can get a message across - they have even been used to judge a company's social media strategy. However, all of this was not enough to satisfy Google, who decided to remove Cameron from her role after an AMA with the company's employee's union, Unite, went public. "As CEO, Mark would always tell everyone, 'This is my opinion, and this is what I think, and I'm not here to please Google,' she was reported as saying. "At Google, we don't believe in censorship," Google said in a statement to The Register. "We believe in people having a voice. We don't believe in censorship. We're a place where people say what they think is important, and have a right to express themselves freely. "We have strong communities across Google products, including Google Plus, Google Buzz, Google+ and YouTube. You can read the full Google statement on their site (it starts at about half-way down this page). "However, we want Google to be a fair platform for all content. As CEO, Mark would always tell everyone, 'This is my opinion, and this is what I think, and I'm not here to please Google,' she was reported as saying. "That was the culture within the company and we have a responsibility to maintain that culture." After the decision was taken to remove her, there was a flurry of messages of support sent to her via Twitter and various other social media accounts. I've also had a lot of people say they'll miss me on Twitter. Some even wishing me a happy day, but others telling me to make an even bigger impact in my new role.  I don't think I can express how grateful I am to everyone for supporting me in my new position at reddit. — kris wylie (@kris wylie) April 4, 2014 Thank you all for your comments yesterday and all of your kind words - that's why I love this job, it's great. It's a fun job, the people that are involved in it all seem to love it. — kris wylie (@kris wylie) April 4, 2014 When Google asked whether she were ready to give up Reddit, Ms. Babchagoff said: "I know what I'm leaving and I don't regret a second of my time here. We were not that close of a company that could be turned on. I will continue to be as involved in reddit as I can. Not to be an expert, but a lot of what I do in reddit is in some ways very similar to what I do at Google so I will be joining forces and sharing knowledge and experience." Since becoming Reddit's COO, she's overseen a major job increase, and has the job of getting Reddit to a bigger audience -	0
Cleveland Indians outfielder Nick Swisher is taking a seat in Arizona. The Tribe's first-time All-Star is dealing with a left knee injury and is "day-to-day" according to the team's blog. Swisher's absence has been more noticeable than it appeared earlier when he hit his third career leadoff home run on Tuesday night to help propel the Tribe to a 6-5 win over the Seattle Mariners. Swisher has been the Tribe's everyday centerfielder over the last several seasons with Nick Swisher, Jonathan Lucroy and Carlos Santana all seeing some time at the position during the regular season. Nick Swisher was signed with the team as a free agent before the 2010 season but wasn't in the majors until last summer of 2011. Follow Shawn Bragg on Twitter @ShawnBragg1 Follow D.C.

In what was the most contentious part of the presidential campaign, the leaders of the Republican Party agreed on one thing: America's problems require new solutions. The GOP candidates spent months staking out the ideological differences and rhetorical ground between them. They argued and sparred during their debates and on social media, and they criticized each other's record and qualifications for the White House. At the end, the party's voters opted for a more moderate candidate, one able to offer a more conservative approach. On Thursday, Donald Trump gave them what they wanted. In a speech in Washington, D.C., he outlined a policy agenda designed to unite the nation against the causes of terrorism and crime—the same kind of focus that has long been championed by his critics. He called for tougher regulations on immigration, a wall along the Mexican border, and a "total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States." It was a sweeping policy proposal. It was a plan for rebuilding America's infrastructure, and it included many familiar Republican policies like cutting taxes for the rich and rolling back regulations—the ones that are, in effect, making America less secure. And it was a direct response to the terror attacks in Paris, which killed 129 on Friday night and which Trump promised the nation to stop. The speech's centerpiece was a proposal to suspend immigration from any country that "substantially" supports Islamic extremism. Trump did not cite specific places. Those countries would include the entire Middle East, Asia, and parts of South America, as well as Canada, and his advisers insist that his proposal would apply equally to the more than 45 million non-Muslim U.S. citizens. "You're going to suspend immigration," the real-estate mogul declared during a rally the following day in Colorado Springs. "I'm not saying it's a religious test." "This has got to be done with heart," he said at the rally in North Carolina. "This has to be done with heart." This was a shift from his earlier statements on immigration and security. "I want to suspend immigration from areas of the world where there's a proven history of terrorism—many of them are parts of the Middle East," Trump told a reporter in September. "Until we know how to do that, we have to suspend immigration from those areas." It's all the more surprising considering how long Trump has been skeptical of many aspects of President Obama's foreign policy and, specifically, his policies toward the Muslim-majority countries that are the source of much of the terrorism in the world. "We'll have zones, which I wouldn't think would work because we have no understanding who would come into those zones," Trump said during an interview last year with Breitbart News. This week, Trump's words turned out to be quite literally a matter of life and death. At 7 p.m. on Friday, a pair of Islamist terrorists struck at the Stade de France.

The last time there was an actual mass shooting in the U.S. the nation quickly shifted towards "guns everywhere" and a culture of violence. This was the case not because of guns, but because of mass shooters. We have now been faced with another mass shooting — and this time the shooter was a known "lone wolf" terrorist. The shooting in Santa Monica, CA at a country music festival killed at least 50 and injured hundreds more, leaving thousands of terrified concertgoers scrambling to take cover. Police said that the "lone wolf" attacker had been identified in surveillance video and was described as a black male — who wore a white T-shirt and a green hoodie. He fled the scene in a gray Honda Civic. He reportedly had two guns and was not armed with a handgun. He did not survive the shooting. However, the mass shooters who have impacted this nation in the past year — James Holmes and the UCSB shooter — both were known to police and had ties to other shooters. For a period of time prior to the 2015 mass shooting at Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Fla., it was a common practice to describe these cases like this: "Police and FBI records show that this shooter had previously been investigated at least twice by authorities… In fact, authorities have linked several mass shooters to the same gun store in Texas — including two who carried out attacks at various gay nightclubs within a two-year period." We often forget about all the innocent lives they took — and that many more were injured. After we move on from the tragedy, however, people ask why there aren't more active shooters? Because at the end of the day — guns are used. We also forget that while the media obsesses over the number of mass shootings, what's often omitted is that 90% of mass shootings are gun control related. This is not a surprise, given there just isn't a way for citizens to defend themselves without either buying a gun or purchasing an active shooter permit. So what's the solution? Since "active shooter" is a catchphrase used routinely by the media, a more accurate description is "active shooter." That doesn't mean there's no attack; but it means that this particular event was a terrorist attack and that it was not a mass shooting. In other words, the people of our country can defend their homes and lives in the case of an active shooter, just as they can protect their families in the case of a terrorist attack. Unfortunately for us, the government has always tried to make us feel it's only about guns. And no amount of rhetoric, "gun-free zones," safe-zones with armed guards, or a bunch of gun sales laws are going to change the fact that our freedoms are in trouble.	0
A group of U.S. researchers have just announced that they successfully managed to send a radio signal to and from the moon that was picked up by Earth. It took 30,000 hours of waiting for the signal to come through and then a further 10,000 to get it back to the moon, but it was worth it. It also means that we don't only have the potential to send messages to the moon, but that it doesn't need to be at the same distance as our communications technology, so it could work even while we are in a spacecraft orbiting Mars or something! The message was sent from Hawaii to the moon on June 12th of this year and is now in the control room of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratories in Pasadena, California. If the signal had ended up on Earth just 10 minutes earlier, it would have hit at the same time as a planned space telescope, allowing astronomers to take a look at the sky and confirm a solar flare or comet was out there. Now they could send an SOS message too and hopefully it wouldn't get lost because we were on our way there. The message itself could be sent with nothing more than an infrared or near-infrared camera to pick up energy from space and send it to Earth in the same time frame as the moon's radio signal. There are a number of possible ways this message could have been sent as it was sent with very little power - we would need to make the signal very bright and strong to be picked up by any telescope on Earth. Advertisement The scientists behind the experiment (the team in question was led by David Shoemaker, David Wessel, and Dan Bongard from the University of New Hampshire and a number of other universities) used a spacecraft called the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter which has been orbiting the moon for the past decade. With a resolution of about 60 kilometers and a number of sophisticated sensors, the telescope was designed for this exact purpose (at the time of its launch from Earth in 2009 the resolution was 25 kilometers) but was unable to achieve the needed resolution before the mission came to a end last September. The team wanted to send the signal through a gap in the path of LRO and then use the same telescope to take an image to confirm it. This is the technique used in all of the successful Earth-Moon communications experiments we have, and has been tested before on Mars. LRO successfully passed the signal in between two larger spots on the moon to where the data can reach Earth. This has made it impossible for Earth to send out an SOS to be picked up by satellites or anyone else for a while but it was worth it to get as many details as they could get away with for the message to reach Earth. You will never send a message to a moon on a plane and not have a very clear idea of where is is. Advertisement In total, the team has calculated that in order for the lunar signal to reach Earth (and therefore Earth) it would need to travel at least 956 kilometers. We are currently very, very, very far away from being able to send a radio message to the moon - the minimum distance is more than 12 million kilometers - and while some progress is being made the distance is so vast that it is going to require some major breakthroughs in space technology to send any message into space at all from our own planet. We're going to need to make radio signals the next time we send out any signals to space or send any signals to any other planet but we might not have decades to wait.

The last few weeks have been exciting, in that I've done a handful of interviews where I've been asked a few questions that were about the book itself. I'm now up to around 20! Here are some answers I've already given (some of them to a very small community of book folks in the U.S.). I will probably do some other interview videos at some point. If you've missed the first video which covers a lot of the main content of my book, you can see here: https://medium.com/media/1a4de9c0e5ac0aa7de96f0e2feb47f6/href! I hope to be able to have a few more these weeks. Thanks for your support! :)	0
The two men, identified as 24-year-old Andrew Jackson and 25-year-old Daniel Wood, were each charged with one count each of sexual assault on a child under the age of 12, two counts of sexual assault and one count each of sexual exploitation of children and communicating with a child to engage in sexual activity. Jackson was also booked on counts of endangering the welfare of children. The victim was taken from the house and police said the two men are related. Jackson's mother and sister are said to be in Georgia. According to police, the investigation started back in June when the victim was told Wood gave him marijuana and alcohol when he was just nine years old. Investigators learned that over the last two years, the alleged assaults continue to occur. The victim has been identified by his first name and the first several letters of his last name, but didn't provide additional information about his identity when contacted by FOX 5. "I was angry," the victim said Wednesday afternoon. "I was angry because I wanted to protect my younger sisters from this." This attack marks the third of abuse the victim said he's dealt with. He described the two men he met during his time in therapy as family. "I have a cousin and he's my best friend. I've seen him since I was four years old. He's like a big brother to me," he said. "But when it started, he just kept going. I said, 'Mom, it's my fault.' She said I didn't do anything wrong. She asked for forgiveness because she didn't know about it." Jackson and Wood are the son and nephew of police officers. Jackson is also the brother of Assistant Chief Jason Jackson of the Miami Twp. Police Department. "The department is cooperating with the investigation being conducted by Miami Dade police and the state attorney's office," Assistant Chief Jason Jackson said Thursday. The investigation was conducted by the Miami Dade Police Department and the Miami-Dade State Attorney's Office. Anyone with information should call Miami Crime Stoppers at 305-471-TIPS.	0
How about that? I've been working on some code that makes a number of games a little faster, a little more responsive, a little more fun. For those of you who don't have a clue what that is, it's basically a fancy word for "less time spent on memory and disk io". All of the apps that the game uses have to be preloaded. As soon as you fire up a new game, the code needs to make sure that the libraries are loaded, and the game knows how to interact with each one (how many players, which buttons to press, etc.) After that the app calls into the OpenGL library, which is the heart and soul of many modern OpenGL applications, loads and renders objects, and then runs various graphics operations to display text, sprites, and so on. This is all done so quickly the user doesn't really notice that it was slowed down. Some programmers complain, sure, but I've heard that one as well. There are a few ways of reducing this load time. The most straightforward way is to just have some kind of dedicated thread to take care of these things. Usually this is a game thread that simply reads and writes OpenGL objects, while doing the graphics stuff it handles itself. The main performance bottleneck here is reading from the GPU, so most games are just written in terms of drawing one line at a time and then repeating that for all the lines drawn on screen. But games have some drawbacks. Because they're written in OpenGL, they need dedicated threads to do stuff, but OpenGL does not (and never will) give any guarantees what CPU or GPU the program will use when it's done with the graphics stuff. In fact, OpenGL also doesn't provide any guarantees what other program will be using it. The program can choose any other operating system, or graphics driver, or OpenGL implementation, or whatever, and any or all of these could take over the CPU and GPU at any time and block the rest of our game from being played. There are plenty of games out there out there that don't care about this stuff. My solution is to try to make some parts run on multiple cores of the GPU at the same time. This requires creating a special class of graphics and graphics context that contains, among other things, the resources the game has access to, and handles OpenGL calls. Then, when we want to run the game, we call these from a separate thread and set some flags, like, "run the game on the GPU on these cores" and "do all the rendering from the GPU," and then use the graphics context to hold all the game's objects. We have access to the graphics context's render pipeline with the GraphicsContextCreateInfo. void CreateGameOnGLContext( GraphicsContext * ctx) { ... // Render to GPU while (GraphicsUtility.CurrentRenderPass() != null) { GraphicsRenderInfo * gi = ctx->GetGPURenderInfo(); // ... // Render to CPU // ... } } 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 void CreateGameOnGLContext ( GraphicsContext * ctx ) { . . . // Render to GPU while ( GraphicsUtility . CurrentRenderPass ( ) != null ) { GraphicsRenderInfo * gi = ctx -> GetGPURenderInfo ( ) ; // ... // Render to CPU // ... } } The trick to this is that the graphics context only uses the GPU when there's stuff that needs to be drawn, and then puts the rest onto the CPU when there's nothing that needs to be drawn. Basically, we allow the GPU to run stuff before we need it, but then we put the CPU to idle when there's no reason for it to be. This allows our OpenGL code to draw stuff while making sure that whatever else is happening in the system doesn't bog down our game. This means that our Game class itself only has one OpenGL context, and uses only OpenGL when that context is not already already in use. This is really just a convenience method that allows us to use our old friend GLCmd in a new and fun way. GLCmd allows us to control what OpenGL stuff to run on different cores, and to set certain flags. These flags come in three flavors: CL_GLSL_ALLOW -- OpenGL code should run on any CPU (we have no guarantee this is still true 20 years from now, but that's what the flag is for). CL_GLSL_ANY -- OpenGL code should run on CPU or GPU, depending on which driver we're using. This is the flag you'll notice on the top of almost every Linux laptop. CL_GLSL_SINGLE -- OpenGL code should only look at one core. This flag is used in Linux for games using Direct3D or OpenGL, for example. If you're running on an Intel CPU it doesn't appear on your system, which is	0
I was asked that evening which of the recent 'new atheists' had my favourite tweet, or my favourite quote. It's a fair question, but one that I can't answer without taking my first step in explaining where I myself currently stand on the various issues at play here. It could have been, as Andrew Brown puts it, a joke. Perhaps one made by a 'new atheist', as I'm currently hoping, that simply goes unnoticed. But it could have been, as I understand it, my own account. So: a tweet mocking a 'new atheist', my own tweet, mocking my own tweet. A person's account is usually not the best place to talk about their own views, in particular. But sometimes, one's own tweet, or an individual's reply to a tweet is the best place to be specific. My actual views on many of the 'new atheist' issues will be revealed here shortly, because I think they will be very interesting indeed. My views will not necessarily be identical to those of others in the new atheist ranks. I am not a part of any major, official organisation. Nor do I currently write books for a living or anything like that. Why that tweet though? What was the purpose of the tweet, what was the purpose of that reply? A few reasons come to mind, none of them especially compelling. Because: 1. I'm a long-term campaigner for the humanist perspective. 2. This is what I believe: - That religious belief and non-belief are incompatible, not just incompatible, but utterly incompatible. - That religious belief is dangerous, and that it is in our best interests to eradicate it, regardless of who has the power or influence to make that happen. - That religious belief and non-belief are incompatible with individual rights, irrespective of where we live. - That the humanist worldview is preferable, and that religious belief is a consequence of flawed, flawed worldviews. - That those of us for whom religion has no appeal, who wish to live free of religious interference and influence, and who seek to make the world a better place in general, do so because of how we think, not because of who some religious person claims to be. - That religion is a problem that must be tackled to prevent it from taking hold in the first place – a problem that could easily be countered by humanism. - That humanism is the correct philosophy, both humanist and non-humanist. But to use the word 'humanist' in the present context is to be deliberately ambiguous, and to imply that it's a philosophical position that can be applied to any and all individuals, regardless of whether they are humanists or not. In a recent blog post, my friend John Searle puts it well: "I am not a humanist… not yet, not ever." - That I am not a critic of religion. I believe in an atheist God; if you feel you need a God, I say you can have it, but if you don't, find a different one – humanistic or no. - That if we are to have a world full of people who believe in a divine being, we need to be able to explain (in the most reasonable terms) why. Not just because it's 'nice' to believe in a supernatural agent. - That people are best served by living with those who disagree with them. - That if we want a more just society, those with power must, if possible, be held to account for their actions, not just those who lack that power. Let me reiterate: I am not a critic of religion. But I am critical of religion on several of those issues above. Let me put it this way: I believe that those things described by the terms 'new atheist' and 'atheism' – and those things that were criticised by 'new atheists' in their earlier work – are both wrong. And those things described by 'new atheists' in their later work – namely, that: Humans are basically good We do good things in the world God does not exist And therefore non-believers have no reason to believe in anything (and I think those latter criticisms are mostly misguided), I believe that religion is damaging to our society, by fostering prejudice and ineffectiveness and a general lack of coherence, and I believe that religion is actually detrimental to our society – both as a force of organised superstition, and as a force of organised superstition that drives the power imbalance between the ruling classes, which the new atheists rightly argue must be destroyed. You might have noticed that I'm writing this on the day after Michael Shermer's first New Atheist book was published, The Moral Arc. In this, he sets out the basis for a good deal of	0
The New York City Police Department has reportedly ordered its officers to stand on the left shoulder of the road at intersections, according to the New York Post. The order was issued this week and is said to follow the deadly officer-involved shootings of Eric Garner and another man in Queens, New York on Monday night. "We understand that all of this was done to help protect those officers as we work to deal with violent crime and stop violence in general," a source that spoke to The New York Post said. "So if you're a cop in a car, get out of it," the individual told the reporters. The NYPD issued a formal statement denying the report. "The New York Police Department does not order its officers to stand next to the left shoulder of the road," the officer's union, the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, told CBS New York. "If this occurred, it would be an example of what not to do, and if it did, it would be investigated." In a statement to The Washington Post, NYPD Commissioner Bill Bratton rejected the report as "absolute nonsense." "The NYPD will not tolerate any attempts to demean the men and women of this organization," Bratton said. Follow Chuck on Twitter	0
I have seen a lot of interesting work going on at The Center for Media & Democracy, especially the "Stop and Frisk Project" we've been running out of the Brennan Center for Justice — the "StopAndFrisk.org" group is a great resource. Let me share my experience working on the "StopAndFrisk.org" effort. I'm not a "law professor" at The Center for Media & Democracy — I'm a public information consultant, or "PR consultant," as I prefer to think of it. That said, my background in communications and public relations has prepared me well for some of these initiatives (and to a lesser degree, working as a police dispatcher), so here are just a few insights I've accumulated. 1. The Stop and Frisk Strategy To start with, there is much more to public awareness against the practice of stop and frisk than just some "loud-mouth" critics complaining about the program. (Just a few weeks a go, there was an interesting report about how some residents of Boston are "scared" of the police.) But the most important factor is the overall effort of people like myself, who are making phone calls, handing out flyers, writing letters, creating content and speaking to journalists and other community leaders to highlight the issue. We have already established a network of community leaders and others who are doing this sort of work, so this is an easy one. 2. The PR Strategy In this case, the strategy is all about building an engaged, activist base that can be mobilized by an increasing wave of "Stop and Frisk" publicity that is likely to follow the Supreme Court's ruling in March on Stop and Frisk in New York City. The effort may initially involve some PR efforts — like media training and media coverage — but more likely they will include a "call-in" program — where people who see an article about a particular issue will call in with their questions. (This is essentially the opposite of the "send a letter" component of the call-in program — you call in, you get a response.) People should be encouraged to call in about whatever issues they have been talking about with other community members. 3. The Leadership Initiative The effort takes a number of different flavors. At the local level, the group may call its members into action by having a leader in each community, or at the very least, by inviting the leaders to participate in the day-to-day operations at the center. But, at the national level, there's also the need to create "community leaders," including by sponsoring an ongoing series of "Congress Fellows" programs to recognize people who use their positions regularly at the local, state and federal levels to advocate on behalf of our civil liberties. There is also an emphasis on developing community action teams (CATs) and/or community task forces (CETFs) to help communities organize and organize their own grassroots-activist activity in opposition to the NYPD. 4. The Community Outreach One very important aspect of the project is to engage with various stakeholders throughout the community. In the New York case, this has helped develop a large and active group of community supporters who have been organizing on a range of issues, such as immigration, policing and the economy, as well as many other issues with respect to police brutality and criminalized housing policies. They have become advocates for our core civil liberties, and in the past few months have taken on a series of other issues, such as police transparency and the police use of stop and frisk. They have formed their own "Committee of Concerned Citizens" and, with the support of The Center for Media & Democracy, are working closely with their local chapter of the Coalition for Police Accountability (CPA) to strengthen their capacity to hold the police accountable. 5. The Campaign Organizers There are a very large number of people who are doing this work every day in communities all over the city. Many are young, especially young people who are just entering the workforce. To date, about a dozen of them have already been charged with felonies (such as "disturbing the peace" — which basically means "getting in the way of the cops"). But, as these youth make connections with other similar minded young people, they will be recruited into more substantive campaigns that will focus on these and other core issues. 6. The Advocacy Groups Finally, there are the so-called "advocacy groups." The most important of these work tirelessly in communities to help people organize on issues they care about. These include, but are not limited to: community organizations working for immigrants' rights and justice, religious organizations and groups working on religious and racial issues, progressive political organizations such as the Working Families Party, and so-called "social justice" groups, such as the Community Service Society and the International Action Center, who are working every day on issues ranging from labor law reform	0
A new study from University College London and the University of Basel showed that a specific protein in the brain may be responsible for our ability to experience sexual pleasure, rather than just sex drive. The research is published in the open access journal Cell. The main point of this paper is that the ability to experience pleasure may have a genetic basis (or at least a shared underlying molecular mechanism). According to the author of the study, Dr. Mihaly Breskoff: "In this work we show for the first time that the brain's protein dopamine D2A receptors may be involved in the ability of the brain to modulate sexual arousal. Our work indicates that the brains dopamine D2A receptors are directly involved in sexual arousal and that they play a role in determining which brain circuits are important for sexual behaviour. Our understanding of the molecular basis of sexual reward and arousal has been greatly stimulated over the past decade, and the ability to directly manipulate dopamine D2A receptors in the brain will therefore be of great interest to scientists who study this process. "This research is part of a new wave of research that aims to better understand how different parts of the brain interact. These new models of brain function are of great importance to understanding the neuropsychiatric disorders caused by disorders of attention and mood - such as disorders that affect mood states - and also from their possible role in disorders that involve problems with impulse control and inappropriate emotional or sexual reactions. Our findings might also have important implications on future understanding of a number of neuropsychiatric disorders, such as addiction and schizophrenia. "We have found that dopamine D2A receptors are activated by pleasurable stimuli such as food and music and that dopamine D2A receptors in the striatum and orbitofrontal cortex are involved in modulating sexual behaviours and subjective responses in humans, and possibly in animals." A good illustration from this study is the role of dopamine D2A receptors in drug addiction, because they can play an important role in preventing withdrawal when a drug is withdrawn.

New York Daily News The New Jersey Devils didn't play in their final regular season game. They don't count until March 1. So don't buy into the hype of a "first-round" playoff series against the Pittsburgh Penguins. We do have the first-round playoff bracket. Yes the Pittsburgh Penguins are in the East because they went to the Cup Finals. But that's the best thing you could say about the Penguins -- they didn't need to make the Eastern Conference Final at all -- they just made it. They will have to go through the New Jersey Devils. They will play them three times -- three in four weeks starting this weekend in New Jersey. Here are the lines, defense pairings, goaltenders, power plays, and line combinations for each game on Saturday. (All times Central) New Jersey Devils at Pittsburgh Penguins (Feb. 20) New Jersey Devils goalie Cory Schneider vs. Brian Dumoulin, Kris Letang, or Kevin Porter. There are three possibilities.

Hair and make-up I've been using Vidal Sass for my Make Up and Hair looks for a couple of years. After hearing so much about it, I decided to give it a try. Unfortunately, it took me an eternity to get to grips with it as it had a way of overwhelming me. This was to be expected because I have a small, rather delicate face and I didn't want to damage my make-up in the process. This is not because it's 'difficult, it's because I don't own a mirror as I'm afraid my reflection will look like I'd had a go at some make-up artist! Vidal Sass is a little like makeup brushes. They can be bought in different types; straight, round or angled. Make-up brushes are much less expensive than Vidal Sass and you have a great range available. I found the straight brushes to be perfect for me especially when it came to a touch of rouge or colour. The angled brushes were good for application to my cheeks. These also made quick and easy application for my eye shadow. Hair is one area where Vidal Sass comes in as a winner. Firstly it has a much larger range than the brushes that come in the regular range of Vidal's; there is Vidal Style and Vidal Style Extreme. As Vidal's go the extra mile when it comes to hair, it's fantastic value if you have an hour to burn before you meet your client. The only thing I would like to see was a little more range in colour and a little more variety in terms of the types of hair you can buy if you just want a specific style. Vidal's colouring pencil range are also a must-have; their colours are super pigmented, they have a matte finish and are easy to apply. The only thing I would say is a little disappointing is that all the colours are very different in taste and range with a few in-between colours and lots of really dark shades. However, these are some of the main colours that come in the collection so these have to do with the different styles they are best suited to. In my opinion, Vidal Sass comes pretty much in all standard colours. The one issue that I have with Vidal's hair line is that they are slightly too wide, I found that applying just the colour on, was not enough. I would have preferred a few shades around the face and I'd have liked the pencil to go further up on my neck. Vidal's brushes are great value for money so I recommend buying some to have a go! I can't see any reason not to give this product a go as the range is extensive and you can't go wrong. For more information about Vidal Sass, visit www.valinsass.co.uk or give them a call on 020 7660 5500. A note on makeup brushes Before making a purchasing decision, it's important to remember that cosmetic brushes are highly specific and as such they contain ingredients that may need to be kept under close guard when not in use. Many such ingredients are not suitable for most people. Always consider the ingredients and the end result before purchasing a cosmetic brush. You can also check this page for more information about safety. If you are sensitive to some of these ingredients, I recommend only using cosmetic brush on the most sensitive parts of your body as you will not get any further benefit from them. I know all this is a little lengthy but it's important so I hope you find it useful. I am always happy to help people, just give me a call. ©Vidal Sass 2011	0
The following message was emailed to all the members of Team Canada. This is from Dave Farrar, Team Canada Sports Director, and you can view the PDF version online here: The Olympic Games are coming to town. More than 200,000 Canadians have signed on to participate, from young athletes and adults to kids and older fans. The biggest excitement, though, is across our country. We've got a lot of fun events in store for our fans and partners, and we need your help making them happen in 2018. This summer, Team Canada's events will feature more than a million fans, athletes and other supporters. We've spent the last three months preparing for this year's Olympic Games, and will be taking the best of what we learned in Rio with us to Vancouver. We've been hard at work, and we're excited to share how we're building for a successful 2017-18 Olympic Campaign, the best ever at the Games for Canadian fans. Here's a quick run down of the major steps we've taken so that Team Canada can make history next year. Olympic Experience Last summer, we set goals and shared what we'd done, and what we would be doing for the upcoming Olympic Games. We made sure we weren't forgetting anyone, and that the Games were the best they could be for our fans, athletes and teams. Our experience in Rio was a huge learning experience for Team Canada. We learned from our mistakes and moved quickly to adapt and address the realities of training and competing at a high level on home soil. We used the lessons we'd learned in Rio to help shape our Olympic Experience concept for this summer. Here are a few highlights from our Olympic Experience for 2017-18 to help you prepare for the Olympics in Vancouver this year. On the Road in Canada At every Games, Team Canada goes on road trips and visits new communities and destinations across the country. We will be taking this experience from Rio with us to Vancouver, starting with a visit to the Great White North in June, followed by a trip to the Southwestern Ontario region in August. Olympic Plaza in Vancouver is a welcoming venue for our members, team and supporters. It's where members congregate during training and games, and it's what they expect to see as the Games approach. The Plaza also plays a key role in connecting our members, teams and fans all over the country. There are more than 20 kiosks around the Plaza that will be dedicated to our Olympic Experience goals and features. We'll be displaying and advertising our Olympic highlights, a photo wall to capture the moments, and the latest news from Team Canada. Team Canada is dedicated to the development of a strong and vibrant sport and cultural community across Canada. Here's what we've done to inspire and support sports and cultural communities in Canada. Olympic Village, Canada Team Canada is proud to have established our Olympic Village in Ottawa. It's home to members, staff, volunteers and fans, and offers a variety of amenities including the latest technology equipment and accommodations. The Village is designed to make it easy to travel between Vancouver and Ottawa or Vancouver and the rest of Canada in the event Team Canada is in a city like Vancouver or a neighbouring city with large fan bases. You can also come join Team Canada and have the opportunity to be a part of Canada's Team at the Olympic Plaza with us this Canada Day, as we celebrate Canada 100. The Village is the centrepiece of the Team Canada team experience, with more than 15,000 pieces of memorabilia scattered around and a number of large displays, including a giant Canadian Olympic flag and the famous Olympic Rings, made from thousands of bricks. What's not to love about the village? It's a great place for fans to come and celebrate Canada 100, and the whole experience puts Team Canada in good company. Many international teams come and go, but when Team Canada is around, they make everyone's experience a special one. Inaugural Game with Team Canada We'll have something a little different this time around, with Team Canada returning to Vancouver in the inaugural match of the Olympic Tournament taking place this summer. It's not the first time we've welcomed Team Canada with a match in Canada. We hosted Team Canada for the first time at the Pan Am Games five years ago, and there's been a long history of us supporting Team Canada. This will be our third time welcoming Team Canada to Canada, and for our fans, it's the next perfect time to get involved with the game. We've already made a number of commitments to allow our fans to be involved. For fans coming from coast to coast, the Team Canada Match will be played at our new national stadium, Tim Hortons Field, but we will also be having the match at Olympic Plaza next summer with other fans in the village to celebrate Canada 100. The Games in Canada The Olympic Games will have more than a million people attending them in	0
"Haven't got time to kill" is a very common mantra when a man is planning to go on a date. A man, after seeing the woman he is interested in is not interested in getting to know him and he's getting tired of waiting for her to get around to it. After this "excitement" is over with he might just say "Haven't got time to kill" because he's tired of waiting for woman and she's not interested in ever meeting him. Well this is quite a common phenomenon and women do it. Women will wait until the man is finished with sex when she comes home from work, they will wait until the man is finished eating his meal when they come home from school, they will wait until the man is done at the gym, they will wait until the man is sitting still when he meets up with someone and that's all the "excitement" they are ready to be over with. Women actually enjoy waiting for man so much that they actually want to make a man wait the entire time, sometimes for an hour or more, just to see him. The reason why women do this is because women want to play this one guy game in their life for the rest of their lives. They don't want to ever be alone so they create a fake friend who is always by her side but will never be a real friend to her. This is also how a lot of women are the way they socialize and the way they are looking at being a woman (I'm just speaking from what I have seen and experienced because I have only made two out of the hundred relationship I have had and I don't know all the other things men go through with a woman). The way they socialize is by creating a fake friend, for example, the female friend I have that is an actor I met at a club, I met the actress through my friend. The actress and I met in a club and we got to know each other very well. I was at the club because it was a birthday party for this friend and she used to spend a lot of time with me. Her friends were always going to the same club I was at. I was also with her a lot during the work month so we had regular conversations. I knew she was a big fan of my music but I didn't tell her because I didn't want to upset her and I didn't want her to think I was playing mind games with her. I didn't want to be the guy she was looking for and if she were thinking about me and seeing me out I would always be there and I would always have something to say to her. I didn't have time to kill because after I came out of sleep and I would have to go to work and do something to pay the bills I would have to get up early in the morning to have coffee and get ready to work. She would be watching the news and I would talk to her about the news with her and I would tell her about other movies that I watched. Whenever we had time for just conversation (even during the day, at the cafe, or at home) she was ready for whatever conversation we were having. In that way I made her feel special and the more I made her feel special and the more she felt special to me (she was the only person in my life who I could really talk to with my mind) the more I wanted to talk with her. The more she wanted to talk with me, the more I wanted to talk with her, so we did things that we had never done before. We would talk a lot, we would go to the cinema, visit the park to see nature, we would go to a beach with our families and stay out late and watch surfers (this became very normal to us because on our regular trips we are always on our own and the only one with us). This went on for quite some time and then my friend asked me if I wanted to go out for a drink one night. I said yes I did. So our friend invited me to go out with a couple from the movie studio. They had always liked my band and I liked them too. They also liked my music so they asked me if I wanted to join them and they were really happy to have me join them. They were in love with me, not that I could tell because I had never been in love with anyone in my life, it was all just a movie and I was just there to entertain and have fun. When we arrived at the studio I was really happy they would have me, it was my first time seeing them ever and they loved me. In the movie I had been a villain, a nice guy and I was just hanging out and enjoying myself. We drank beer and went and ate at one of those famous restaurants the studio was famous for. After that I ended up spending the night in the bedroom of the two actors. They gave me a lot of food and drinks, they took me to the sauna. The	0
The world is full of amazing things. Some of them even start as simple things. One of the first things we did on our very first day of life was to walk up and down the garden path. I mean, why should we not take that walk?  There is this thing called gravity. You can feel it as soon as you are born, but as you will soon see, we humans are also very aware of it. We can take any motion and make it gravity. This is the basis for a lot of amazing things. If you were to stand on every single point in the Universe and then run around a few times doing exactly the same, it would take you a couple of minutes just to catch your breath; because you would be running against all other objects in the Universe. But now, you don't have to worry because you can get up and down with the simplest of movements.  So, first of all, let's talk about the word itself. I'm sure that most of you are familiar with the word gravity when it comes to physics. This word has many definitions, but for the sake of simplicity here is what I think about them: • Gravity is a force that attracts objects towards each other • Gravity is the force that causes objects to fall down • Gravity is a force that is acting on an object on a rotating surface and causes it to fall down. For both of these definitions, the point here is that gravity is something that affects our bodies. And the two types of gravity that we are going to talk about today only affect the rotation of our bodies, not the motion of the objects they interact with. If you want to know more about the physics of how gravity works, read this post. Or for more about why your body has gravity: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/10/130927132325.htm?from=sci In any case, let's go back and discuss how this works in our very first example we can start with, the garden. Our world is spherical. It is made up of a flat surface called Earth, along with the Moon, Sun, and all of the other objects in our universe that orbit the Earth's surface. On Earth, there is an atmosphere. This means that there is some sort of particles in the air that interact with each other and send out waves that cause our day and night cycle to take place. On our very first day in Earth's life, all of this happened in a very short amount of time. But this is just another example for all of the incredible things that we have seen in our Universe.  If you were to walk up and down this garden path, you would have to feel something called gravity. This is how it behaves: The ground has one pole towards you. If you were to walk away from the pole, it would push you off to your right The right side of the path would also push you, but in a direction opposite of that which you normally feel This is what gravity is like. In a word, how a point on the surface of a spinning ball with a radius of R exerts angular momentum on objects in the surrounding area. Gravity is the force that attracts objects towards each other at a point in space. Our planet actually has two poles. The right pole (R) is towards the Sun (the top of the Earth). This means that the right side of our path is not pushing any of you away from the right pole. So if you had been to walk straight across the right pole, you would feel a tug from Earth (this is what gravity on Earth feels like).  You, however, would be pushed away from the right pole by the Moon, the Sun, and the Earth. You would feel these forces all coming from the rotation of the Sun, Moon, and Earth (which is not the same as the rotational force created by the Earth itself). As you will soon see, gravity is not really an "force" in the sense that that it acts on you. It is acting on your bodies because a point on an object moving in the opposite direction of an object is going to push that object away from the object. This is how, for example, you might see objects spinning in the sky. These objects will act as if they were also orbiting the Earth due to our very own rotation.	0
An elderly couple in Michigan died Saturday night after a large crowd gathered outside a local hospital for some reason and lit a funeral pyre. The man and woman both died after they suffered from smoke inhalation and cardiac arrest while waiting in the front of the West Bloomfield hospital for a doctor to arrive, according to local media station WDIV. The funeral pyre started before the man in his 80s and the woman in her 60s were pronounced dead, WDIV reports, citing police. The fire was quickly contained to a small portion of the building, which is on the grounds of a Catholic Church in West Bloomfield. At least 200 funeral vehicles, police cars, fire trucks and a helicopter were at the scene, CNN reports. The hospital was placed on lockdown, with ambulances not allowed to enter or leave the premises for several hours, WDIV reports. West Bloomfield Police Department Captain Patrick O'Rourke told CNN that the fire began as the couple waited at the hospital's emergency room entrance and that both occupants had been smoking marijuana. The man "was in a state of shock," O'Rourke told CNN. "He was having trouble breathing and was hallucinating."  It's unclear why the elderly couple would have traveled such a long way to attend a funeral. Many other news outlets are reporting that the husband died after the couple had been in an automobile accident, though. Police told WDIV that alcohol may have played a role in the accident, although O'Rourke, the police spokesman, told CNN that "no evidence links the couple's loss of life to the crash." O'Rourke added that the couple "had been intoxicated" prior to the accident. The funeral pyre took place about 10 p.m., but there is no word yet on whether anyone is under investigation in connection with the fire.	0
Bread Loafers, which are now available for pre-order at Target, are made in Japan from high-quality, high-tech fabrics. However, they're made in the U.S. But why? And isn't there a problem? The simple answer is: It depends, for certain, on whether you're a fan of high-tech materials or not. According to The Wall Street Journal (a publication whose editorial board I greatly admire so much that I decided to buy their digital subscription for $4 in December 2012), the loafers are made in California, where high-performance cloth fabric is used, but are manufactured in Mexico in the U.S. If you are a person who believes that the only legitimate reason for American companies to source from Asia would be to save a few pennies, then you are absolutely correct, as the cost of Chinese cloth has been dropping in the past year. Here's a sampling of what people were able to pay. But if you are a person who understands that there are multiple legitimate reasons for a company to source from Asia, then you will likely feel disappointed. Yes, these were only very small samples. They aren't enough to get a proper sense of the overall cost of manufacturing these garments. In fact, The WSJ went on to explain that the "bargain-basement price on Target's loafers — $22.50 a pair — is a world of difference for most people whose pockets can't stretch that far, especially ones who've given up on trying to save even $10 a day. After that, the loafers, made of lightweight stretch-poly fabric made in Germany, are not much more economical than U.S.-built goods from brands typically found at high-end department stores." That's a world of difference from $21.49. What this means is that if you live in California, there's no doubt that you pay more to buy those loafers in the U.S. That's because, in the past year, there has been a worldwide, dramatic reduction in the cost of cloth fabric used in the clothing and fashion industries, and that trend is expected to continue for the foreseeable future. The WSJ further explained that when compared to traditional clothing production, cloth manufacturers are able to produce garments with lower costs because they require no "specialised facilities, and thus do not produce the same range of quality-controlled goods as their competitors in developed countries." In other words, this means that American companies are able to utilize their factories to produce a higher quality product in a lower time frame. In other words, while they use a similar method as their competitors, manufacturers in the U.S. actually have lower quality controls because they don't need to, which could, in turn, be the reason why some people feel that American firms are getting away with cheap manufacturing. Of course, this isn't to say that it's a free ride that's being provided to U.S. businesses. Yes, they are able to produce cheaper goods in the short term, but this is a result of economies of scale, and it will require time, resources, and energy before costs fall as drastically as they have in China. On top of that, there will have to be new policies put in place by the government in order to regulate the cost for American consumers when it comes to purchasing American-made goods. In other words, we will have to see the results of the policy changes put into place by the Trump administration by year's end. Meanwhile, Target itself is doing everything it could to ensure that its business isn't the first to be hurt by the rising costs of manufactured goods. Target is providing discounts to American consumers who buy these loaves of bread. This is to ensure that as the costs of fabric continue to drop, American customers won't have to pay the full price they currently do. Additionally, this is to encourage shoppers from the U.S. to travel to Target stores and check out the products themselves. Target is providing discounts to American consumers who buy these loaves of bread. These bread loafers will only be available for purchase in U.S. stores for a limited time – at around $21.49 – making them cheaper than ever. But what can someone do about it? To me, I feel like Target is actually doing some pretty smart things by allowing Americans to buy these loafers at discounts. This isn't the first time they've done this; back in March, they lowered the price of Target Club memberships $20 for a limited time. Additionally, Target offers free shipping for orders of three items, which is especially useful if you're looking to do an in-store pickup of these loaves of bread. So, while this may be a temporary situation, I encourage you to take advantage of Target's offers and, in so doing, save a few dollars as well.	0
The only thing better than a pair of high-quality, custom-made pairs of pants you get to wear each other to work or the grocery store, or even every day, is the idea of a custom pair that a buddy will want to go out for lunch and a game of ping pong with next time you all have lunch. I've been putting together that type of pants since I was a wee youngling, and I'm still doing it to this day. And here is a collection of the best custom-made jeans I've built that will inspire any type of pants or pant repair.	0

In the first part of the post, I briefly described the three major themes in this paper, namely the relationship between language acquisition and development, the structure of an artificial language, and the role of grammar. 1. Language Acquisition and Development For this post, I will try to focus on the structure of an artificial language. In the first section of this paper, I will provide a simple way to think about an artificial language's structure. In the next section, I will discuss the key points of an artificial language and its meaning. Then, in the third part, I will show that an artificial language is the most plausible way of representing a concept which may be learned when we experience it directly. In this way, the structure of a language can give one insight into the way that a concept is learned, and even how we are able to represent some of the cognitive processes involved in learning. 2. Simple Forms The first section of the paper describes the structure of a set of English words. Each word consists of two parts, one which stands separately before the meaning, one which stands after the meaning. For example, the word drink includes one part which stands separately before the meaning and another which stands after the meaning. A more complex sentence would be one containing both parts separately before the meaning and one part which stands after the meaning. (This is why so many sentences have more than one meaning. One could have a sentence like "The boy asked the girl for a beer." In such a sentence, the whole sentence could stand separately after the meaning and simultaneously together before the meaning.) The structure of a word-formation is just a simple combination of part-separation and part-combining. For example, the word drunk can be formed as an adjective, a verb, or a noun. When this is done, the whole form looks like a sentence: "She was drunk." An actual sentence consisting of four parts looks like this: She was drunk. In an artificial language, a simple construct like this can be learned by a human child, who may learn both kinds of form in parallel: Drunk. She was drunk. This simple construction is called a compound. There are two kinds of compounds. One kind of compound has no separations and may be called simple compound. It does not involve combining words: One may simply combine words at their stems: One may simply combine words at their stems. This form is often used in written language for simple words such as drink and be with a special symbol, as in the sentence in the previous section. This simple type of compound is a good example of the concept i-adjective compound. A different kind of compound has only single separations, does not combine words at the stems, is called compound word. Some compound words may be constructed without starting from basic roots: This is often called compound noun, and can make complex sentences: The two women drove. The two men walked. The two houses passed. Each compound word consists of the noun and the root or suffix of the root. An example of an i-adjective compound is this: She was surprised. 3. A Simple Syntax The next section of the paper describes three basic elements of the syntax of words in the language. By syntactic elements I mean, of course, the symbols which appear in the input. For each of these elements, I discuss the three ways in which these symbols could be combined to form more complex syntactic forms. The three ways in which each element could be combined are: Syntactic groups : The two symbols in a clause can be rearranged to show a syntactic group. Syntactic clauses : The two symbols in a clause can be rearranged to form syntactic clauses. Syntactic rules: The two symbols in a rule or constraint can be rearranged to show a syntactic rule. Syntax as a language structure What does the syntactic elements which I describe in this section really mean, and what does it do to structure the syntax of words? First, I will consider how the syntactic elements, syntactic groups and syntactic clauses combine to form a structure that contains information pertaining to what the sentences mean. Second, I will consider how these syntactic elements determine what a given sentence means in the way that its meaning is determined by other information. 3.1. The Syntactic Groups The elements in a syntactic group can be classified into two groups. Symbolic groups have symbolic representations and act as markers for a specific meaning. In other words, such groups contain symbols which convey the meaning of the word. For example, the words order and order-by refer to specific orders of things: order , by , at , and in . Some of the symbols which can appear in a symbolic group is represented by the Latin letter sigma	0
Greetings Backers and welcome to our second Kickstarter Update. Last time we explained how we plan to deliver an expanded, multi-platform Star Citizen experience, but this time we want to talk about the game you will get to play when we hit our first stretch goal next week. The Alpha of Squadron 42 is almost ready for production. It's taken a lot longer than we'd like with the delay for the Squadron 42 Alpha. We're planning a second delay because we want to complete some of the remaining high priority tasks. These include a host of bugs discovered during the initial iteration testing. We'll get a lot done on these bugs during our weekly live studio builds but we'd like to complete some of them during Beta, which begins next week. We'll be back next Wednesday with more details about what content you can expect when the beta begins. That is a wrap for this update. We'll see you in the Holonet.	0

LAS VEGAS – UFC light heavyweight champion Jon Jones says his future will be determined during this upcoming title defense against Daniel Cormier on Dec. 3. Jones (21-1) has been a major topic of conversation and speculation while training for and competing in the UFC light heavyweight title fight. He has openly discussed his desire to move up in weight once again. "I mean, you know, I don't have to get a deal [with the UFC] done right now," Jones told a small group of reporters Sunday afternoon at UFC 187's post-fight press conference. "My future is in my own hands and I'm going to determine what kind of future I want. And my family is the first people in my ear. I've got to just trust them. "And I said you know, whatever I want to do, if it's going to take me time and whatever it takes to get ready for the fight," Jones continued. "I just can't get into that right now. It's one month until the fight. I've got to do what's best for my future." Jon Jones and Daniel Cormier will meet for the UFC light heavyweight title at UFC 187. (Getty Images) More Cormier is an eight-time Olympic gold medalist and world champion wrestling coach in the 205-pound weight class. He defeated Junior dos Santos via third-round TKO in March and is currently riding a three-fight win streak. He defeated Alexander Gustafsson in December via unanimous decision before a decision loss to Jones in May. Jones was unable to come through in his last contest against Cormier. He suffered a gruesome cut in the back of his head via Jones' left eye following a first-round technical knockout. Afterward, Jones admitted to several media outlets that he was struggling to find an appropriate way to train on his arm and shoulder after receiving a devastating injury. He's said he had no option but to sit out for four weeks while he recovered, a far cry from training with coaches in preparation for an immediate fight. "What I have to do is whatever gives me peace of mind is what I've got to do," Jones said. "You know, I've always said I'm an athlete to prove a point. You always need to prove a point. And, at the end of the day, you can make any deal you want. So, I will find out what's right for my future and, you know, as time goes on, you guys guys are going to see what I want and what's best for me." Jones will face off with Cormier after all. He and Cormier are set to take on for the UFC light heavyweight title on Dec. 3. After that, it could become a potential matchup between the champion and the top contender to the title.	0
(Last Updated On: December 22, 2014)  I love food – I've written that before – but nothing quite compares to the feeling of having something truly delicious at the end of a long, sweaty, cold day. I'm a big fan of soups and stews (I know I'm not alone) but sometimes the best way to enjoy a recipe is with a side dish (and that's how I like to eat this Chicken and Greens Soup with Zucchini Mashed Potatoes). If you're the kind of person who eats soup with everything, this should be no problem for you. It's the perfect recipe for a chilly, fall evening – or perhaps you want something lighter this weekend for those cooler days ahead. The chicken and zucchini mash will thicken as it simmers (just boil the carrots or potatoes for a few seconds – they won't cook down by themselves), and this delicious broth will have just enough flavor to carry it all along. Add a quick toss with some fresh basil and you're set for a delicious night. You'll find this recipe here on this blog. Thanks for stopping by! Ingredients: 5 pounds boneless skinless chicken thighs, trimmed of excess fat 1 onion, diced 1 bell pepper, diced (or 1 small or 1 medium zucchini, chopped or shredded) 1 cup chicken broth 2-3 cloves garlic, minced (depending on your preference) 1 teaspoon salt 1 teaspoon fresh ground black pepper 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper, or to taste 1 teaspoon fresh thyme leaves, chopped pinch of red pepper flakes, or to taste 1 cup red peeled, chopped potatoes, preferably organic, or frozen, thawed and rinsed 2 cups vegetable broth or water, or water (without lemon juice) 2 cups shredded zucchini (1 small to 1 large clove), in small chunks 1/4 cup fresh basil leaves, chopped Directions: Slice the vegetables into bite-sized small pieces, and cook them over medium-low heat for about 10 minutes, stirring constantly and making sure they don't burn. Remove from the heat and stir in the broth, garlic, salt, red pepper flakes and cilantro, if using. Add 3 cups of water if necessary (it should have thickened a bit.) Bring the broth to a boil, reduce the heat and simmer uncovered for about 20 minutes (it will thicken). (It's possible you may need more broth, if the squash are quite frozen and are not completely cooked yet.) If using frozen zucchini (or if not using the chicken and veggies, you can add this to a separate pot, then bring the sauce to a simmer over medium heat and cook until completely absorbed with the vegetables.) Taste and adjust the seasoning when you're happy with it. If you like, you may also add about 6 Tablespoons of frozen corn and 1/2 cup diced tomatoes to this stew, but I found that the flavor was too intense on its own, and they added too much moisture and liquid to the broth that was necessary for the flavor to be at its best. The corn and tomatoes will thaw and thicken as the whole stew simmers, so you won't need them, but it adds a nice touch! Nutritional Info:	0
In the aftermath of a historic election, there appears to be a lot of uncertainty. It's been a tough few months for Donald Trump, the president-elect who won the election in a razor thin state and who faced criticism during the campaign for his temperament and other issues. He has faced fierce opposition from Democrats—some who say they will go through with a sit-in in the halls of Congress—from within the Republican Party, but he has also managed to make inroads with many people who voted for Hillary Clinton. "There's an enormous amount of fear and anxiety from his base about the future, the uncertainty around immigration, the loss of health care," says Chris Sgro, a political consultant who worked for Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) during his presidential campaign. "And that's been amplified by his choice of Steve Bannon and their relationship with Breitbart." Indeed, during the election, Trump was often criticized by his own party for saying things that were critical of the media, particularly as it pertained to stories about him. Bannon, formerly the chairman of Breitbart News, made a name for himself during the campaign by using that outlet as a platform to take aim at perceived enemies of the Trump camp, including Democrats, establishment Republicans and mainstream media. As he rose through the company's ranks and ascended to the top of Trump's campaign, though, he took the company's political editorial bent to extremes. In May, Bannon, one day before the first general election debate, said, of Clinton, "We're gonna have a very good year. It's going to be a bloodbath. Just look at the polls, you know. You start off with 25, and it's going to get worse and worse . . . and [she's] going to lose big league." He added, "She's the candidate of the past. It's over." He also compared the race to the civil rights movement during a rally in Alabama. Breitbart's most influential writers have also been critical of GOP leaders—one editorial page columnist in March 2015 wrote, "It's time for the #GOP to stop hiding behind Trump's candidacy"—and its coverage of immigration has been among its most strident. Breitbart has been particularly critical of an overhaul of the U.S. immigration system, the "Gang of Eight" immigration plan, in which senators would come up with a comprehensive plan—and Trump's support for it—to reform the nation's immigration laws in 2017. Breitbart's editorial page, in particular, has also been critical of the media for what it perceives to be a bias towards Democratic candidates. In contrast to Breitbart's editorial positions, Politico's own coverage has largely been supportive of Trump, and that trend began even before the election. On the day of the election, Politico published four editorials critical of Trump. One, written by Glenn Thrush, the network's chief White House correspondent, focused on Republican leaders' willingness to work with Democrats. "This was a decision almost by default . . . if Republicans wanted to win the House and make good on their decades-long promises to voters, it would be time for the party to embrace and work with Democrats in a way that Republicans didn't on immigration reform," Thrush wrote. In a post-election meeting on Nov. 15, Politico's leadership and reporters from several other news outlets—Politico reporters Maggie Haberman, Kevin Liptak and Rosalind S. Helderman, among them—gathered in Washington to decide which stories they should focus on in the coming months. While some of the writers came around on Trump more quickly than others—Liptak came around almost immediately after the election, according to several people in the meeting—the consensus was that, for the site, the most important story was the Trump administration's first two weeks. This decision wasn't made without some internal debate. Several sources close to the decision say they were initially surprised by the intensity of the internal debate over whether to devote the most serious resources and attention to reporting on Trump's policies immediately after his victory. The most prominent example of that was reported by Politico in July, when a source close to Trump's campaign said that Bannon, the former Breitbart executive chair, wanted to see the site devote more resources to reporting on immigration in the coming months and that the site's editors were lukewarm about the idea. By contrast, some of the sources say, the consensus around the site to cover Trump's policies in an aggressive manner remained steady as the transition progressed but that the internal debate over how quickly to cover the next several weeks was ongoing. Some of the disagreements between the Breitbart newsroom on the one hand and the Politico newsroom on the other stemmed from differing opinions on what kinds of stories their reporters were capable of generating. Sources close to both newsrooms pointed to a number of stories—notably those detailing Trump's appointments of conservative white nationalists, his apparent conflicts of interest involving his business holdings,	0
We've all seen the videos by now: people dancing with the lights on at weddings, parties and concerts, or taking a disco ball out onto the dance floor. While some people seem to love disco balls and lights, others, like myself, are just a little squeamish about the whole thing. In fact, one of my main reasons, aside from being an awkward-seeming dance partner, was that I never knew exactly when disco ball dancing would happen, when everyone was really dancing like that. I always felt unsure – if the ball was there, what was everyone else doing? The answer to that question and a bunch of others is in a new paper by a group of researchers, who have created what is perhaps "the first ever international online study of disco ball dancing," according to the press release: "People Who Dance With Disco Balls Find It 'Erotic,' 'Romantic' and 'Fun.' " The researchers, led by professor Thomas C. Wadden of the University of Kansas, set out to discover the effects on people of dancing with lights, as opposed to with disco balls or other disco-like products. The question they sought to answer, in part, was how different the two activities were. What we see today are more or less the same dancing that we saw 10 or 15 years ago, but what was once quite different is today a very common – and very much in vogue – dance. So, what kinds of studies, exactly, were they conducting? Researchers used Facebook and video feeds from 3,000 people to see what was going on in both "dark" and "light" areas in dance balls around the world, asking questions at regular intervals throughout the dance. The video footage was also edited to remove the background music and the faces and voices of other dancers, so that viewers could only find out what was going on within a group of couples who were dancing together. "There are two major questions involved with these two styles of dance," Wadden tells Wired. "One is about the way people move when the lights go on. The other is: Do people who dance with lights enjoy the activity more or more than people who dance with disco balls or other products?" According to Wadden and his team, people who dance with lights have to adjust their posture and posture to the music playing on the disco ball. "But if the music is not in sync, this can take away the pleasure of dancing," he says. "So, while it's probably harder to dance to music with disco ball sounds, it's easier to dance because you have a sense of time." So, did disco balls help people dance better? In the videos, for the most part, the people who danced to music with disco balls seemed a little bit more casual than those who danced in the general crowd and who, like us, had to get more intimate with their partners. But the researchers also found that people who danced with lights enjoyed more the "elevated arousal and feelings that were associated with the music in the room while dancing." It is, as they say, "easier for people to adjust, as they feel more comfortable with the music, their dances are more erotic and they feel more comfortable and confident in themselves because of the enhanced state." What about a disco ball for everyone? Wadden believes that more people should consider buying a disco ball. The group that made the first disco balls in the late 1980s, and continues to make disco balls today, did so to help people with disabilities. Some people who are blind can dance with a disco ball, but they still have to bend over in order to dance with it because of their sensory disabilities such as low pressure in their eyes. People who have difficulties seeing can also dance with them. So, for people who can't do dance, disco balls are an excellent alternative. The researchers admit that as a group, they felt there was only the slightest difference in the effects the product had on people and, to some extent, they agree. "The reason we thought there would be the smallest effect was that the effect is so small," Wadden says. It's kind of mind-boggling that people dancing with disco balls don't just see it as a fun novelty like other people do, like a new toy or clothing accessory, the researchers write. "Despite being one of the most popular toys in American homes, they are not regarded as a playmate for children." This suggests that adults have developed a different response to the disco ball. Wadden, who will have a talk on disco balls at TEDxYale and another event at the NYU Stern School of Business in October, sees a bright future for disco balls: "We need to take a cue from older technologies and think about what we are doing with technology that is more sophisticated."	0

Image caption Mr Cameron said the UK was "fully committed" to fighting IS The UK is to send armed combat personnel to the Middle East to train Iraqi security forces, David Cameron has said. The government will also help the Iraqis take the fight to IS in Syria. The prime minister made clear the troops would not be carrying arms - but would be able to be sent back to the UK if they had to return to the battlefield. Mr Cameron said the combat "will happen before the bombing begins" and would not interfere with the UK's air strikes against IS. The prime minister also announced a plan to make the UK's military bases, as well as the RAF's airbases at Morwenstow in Suffolk and Sluis Van airbase in Cornwall, operational from 2017 - and to take other defence spending to 50% of annual spending. In the UK's current defence spending plan, which will be debated in parliament in a series of bills later this year, the coalition said £6bn of military equipment would be acquired by 2020. 'No weapons for us' Speaking after the meeting of the Commons foreign affairs committee on Wednesday, Mr Cameron said: "We've already done an immense amount in the last year, and we're doing more. "We do want to do more, but we're fully committed to doing what we can to make sure that we fight IS everywhere it exists - and we're also continuing to do the things that have helped drive them out of Iraq and Syria and to defeat them on the ground." Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption David Cameron: "The UK is fully committed to doing their part in the fight against [Isis]." Mr Cameron said he "could not rule" out sending British military personnel to fight IS in Syria, either directly or for "advisory" roles. But he said these would be strictly confined to training and advising the Syrian moderate opposition to defend against the threat of Isis. "We're making sure that these things are carried out, but if there's a need to send troops then they will be very limited in what they can do," he said. "They will not be allowed to carry weapons; they will not be deployed with any of the air power; they will not be carrying out command or control tasks. "I can't rule it out, but the government cannot rule out anything. We'll see what happens." 'Unquestionable objectives' The prime minister told MPs: "There are absolutely no weapons for British forces. "They will not even have any vehicles. The RAF's bases in Scotland and the North West are being used more and more to carry out air strikes and they will become more and more important and necessary. "They will take on advisory and advisory and advisory roles with the moderate opposition and they will do this under the rule of international law. "There will be no British combat troops involved in these operations on the ground." Analysis Image copyright AFP By BBC defence correspondent Jonathan Beale It does not change the fundamental reality of the situation and the fact that this is being called a foreign war. For the moment, however, the British public has seen nothing that might come close to justifying it. The only way to counter that is to take the fight to IS on the ground. That means targeting their leaders, their resources, their equipment - the supply lines for their fighters and their leadership itself. It means training Iraqis as they fight on the front line as well as on the internet. It means finding out about where there might be some more British troops on the ground - whether they're on the ground in Iraq, or in Syria. On those questions, the government is saying nothing but that there might be - but that might mean training Iraqi forces more intensively, not necessarily by British troops and not necessarily with British weapons. "I can't rule out" Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn voted for military action in Syria in 2013, though voted against military action in Iraq. "For me all of this doesn't add up," Mr Corbyn told the BBC. "These are the same people we voted on the same side to go to war in Iraq. "I want us to be fighting this barbarity, not turning our backs on it." 'Huge challenges ahead' He called for a "broad-based government taskforce" for tackling terrorism. Asked what that would be, he said: "It could be a taskforce or it could be anything - it could be an all hands response to the threat that we face." Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said Mr Corbyn's comments show "we do not understand how to defeat this threat". She said: "A majority of the British people overwhelmingly backed airstrikes in	0
You could say this might have been a one-off. But we're getting closer to the weekend. On Thursday, we learned the Yankees sent reliever David Robertson to the minors after he was arrested in his home state this week. The Yankees later announced that they would place Robertson on the 15-day disabled list. Robertson was arrested on Monday at a home in Georgia because he had a firearm in his home — a shotgun. (He has been suspended for 30 days by his league and can appeal.) Now, we learn he was also arrested in his house on Thursday. Yankees reliever David Robertson was arrested in his residence in Georgia on Thursday. No charges at this time https://t.co/3C4R3VZq0y Yankees closer Aroldis Chapman was arrested in his home town of Pensacola, Florida, last month in connection with an alleged dispute over $18,000 and allegedly threatened an officer. The New Times reports that Chapman's charges have been dropped and he was released on a $5,000 bond Thursday. This article originally listed both incidents as being with the New York Yankees. We regret the error.	0
After months of delays, the US-Mexico border wall has come under much scrutiny. Not only is the wall going to cost taxpayers over $21 billion, but the estimated completion date has also run into question. According to ABC News: The White House has not yet determined when it will start the border wall, which President Donald Trump has been promising for months. A senior White House official, speaking on condition of a anonymity, told ABC News there are "reasons" to get the wall "getting built ASAP" like "trying to complete" the border wall by Oct. 1 — the 100th day of Donald Trump's presidency. It's unclear how quickly the wall might be finished, and some experts, like CNN's Van Jones, have said it's not going to begin till 2018. The cost of the wall has also been a bit of a sticking point. ABC reports: Federal contracts have been put on hold while the Trump administration considers whether to use a more traditional approach to building federal structures like the Great Wall of China, the Washington Times has learned. Construction could continue on the border wall as long as it's deemed feasible, including in the interior. While Trump promised to build the wall "substantially" for $8 billion, the White House has come out and said it will cost taxpayers "roughly $20 billion." It's unclear whether Congress would agree to any federal spending on a border wall. According to Newsweek, Trump has promised to "make it rain" on the funding, "giving federal money to as many localities as possible so locals can buy the stuff." Even Trump himself once suggested he would get Congress to help pay for it and the president reportedly wants to get Congress to pass a five-year budget to fund that. So how will Congress help? While it is likely that Congress will help pay for the wall, it is unclear if they will also get in on the wall-building effort. President Barack Obama was opposed to the construction of the wall, and he famously said it would be "very difficult" to build it, so don't expect that to change.	0
It might just be the most amazing picture you'll ever see. I first wrote about the amazing sight of this massive squid out of the Atlantic Ocean on Tuesday but after checking online it looks like the story was taken down by the author. So I'm going to have to write another – sorry! – and this time I promise it's worth your time. You'll have to do yourself a favour and go to the article source for the amazing picture – the National Geographic website – to check the source. I really don't know what to make of it. It looks like the photo was taken from the ship Oceania, a research vessel with the National Geographic Society – but at least the name of the photograph – "New Jersey's Great White Tentacle" – is right. I'm sorry for all the wrong names in this post. It was a busy weekend.	0
(Image: Matt Cardy/Getty) The next time you go for a shower, wash yourself off and then head home to enjoy your dinner (if you're lucky), you might see something unusual about your bathroom: tiny bacteria that are normally found inside people's intestines. They are probably not what you think – rather than looking like a giant mass of tiny parasites, these bacteria look more like tiny bits of food, including grains, nuts and fish. Advertisement The microbes are usually found in the mouths, noses and mouths of healthy people, says a team led by microbiologist Michael R. Eisen at Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond, Virginia. This is because the bacteria live inside our guts as part of a symbiosis called a gut-associated microbial ecotype. There are some 1.2 billion microbes in the intestines in the US alone, says Eisen. The symbionts, which include some 2,500 species of bacteria, fungi, archaea, viruses and a handful of parasites, help keep our gut microbes healthy by creating short-chain fatty acids called butyrate and fermenting our food as well as absorbing nutrients like iron, calcium and vitamins C and K. If they die or enter the wrong place, however, the microbes can become a menace, making us sick. One such case is Escherichia coli, which causes a range of common illnesses, such as diarrhoea, stomach cramps, vomiting, diarrhoea, and colostrums. To help stop such bugs entering and messing with our gut, our bodies make a variety of proteins and antibodies to kill them off. But if the body is busy taking care of other things, including fighting off infection, those antibodies can't find their targets, says Eisen. So they are left with the task of finding the microbes themselves. Eisen's team made the discovery in 2012 by isolating gut bacteria from 12 volunteers as they bathed for 30 minutes each time, then washing them off. When the researchers analysed the bacteria, they found that the majority were related to species that were common in the gut but not common in humans. They dubbed the new species Escherichia inermis, after the Greek god of the underworld. They showed that when Escherichia coli was removed from the environment, the bacteria became smaller and more difficult to find, whereas normal bacteria grew larger and easier to find. In addition, they found that the microbes are unable to form colonies on the walls of their natural habitats. "If you put these things into your gut, the bacteria are basically forced to take up residency in your gut membrane," says Eisen. His next goal is to understand how different kinds of bacteria interact with their hosts, and to make it possible to tailor antibiotic resistance in the gut to the microbes most likely to cause health trouble.

Fears that young people will get worse wages as a result of welfare reforms are exaggerated, a new report says, as a new study finds jobs pay more than many take on through welfare. Photo: 123RF A report commissioned by the government found that, even with some allowances, a year's training would pay nearly $50,000 more than a year's welfare payment for a single person, with a couple in a job earning nearly $60,000 more than with unemployment. But it found that some people getting unemployment benefits - often through New Zealand Super - did not have to look for work outside the benefits system to make money. The report found young people in the Youth Allowance and Youth Income Support paid more than the average wage, which is about $38,000 a year. However, the report author, Professor David Bohnett, said the average salary for those on unemployment benefits was $48,000 a year, with a typical person aged 30 to 34 earning about $57,000 a year. Professor Bohnett, a former Labour minister who was sacked as part of a move against corruption in the New Zealand government, said the average income was higher than a decade earlier because of growing income for some families. "The question I have is what's happening is the New Zealand wages are not keeping up with some of these increases in people's income on the unemployment insurance benefits. "(This) is because, if we don't do anything about the inflation issue we're going to get a very large increase in wages over time, but because New Zealand's wages are growing so quickly, we don't keep up." "The real problem is that the wage increase isn't as fast as people would like, so people have to be working more." New Zealand National's deputy leader, Tariana Turia, rejected the report's findings. Photo: 123RF "This report has been debunked. This report fails to acknowledge the tremendous benefits of having an active and engaged workforce which is now one of our most important assets in the modern economy," she said. "That is why I've set the goal of attracting one million foreign students to study in New Zealand by 2025 to help New Zealand meet its potential." But Ms Turia admitted she was worried about jobs becoming scarcer for young people because the National government and ACT were increasing youth unemployment benefits. She said the ACT government's policy change would mean "young people will have as many as two years longer to qualify for youth allowance and New Zealand Super than their competitors in the Pacific Islands," Labour youth spokesman Clayton Cosgrove said that while unemployed young people needed to be looking for work and training, "some employers just don't see it as a priority and they prefer to pay higher wages because they can afford it". "The reality is that employers want the best workers they can get, and they just aren't going to pay people anywhere near the prices this Government is asking people to pay." The report was released by the Institute of Economic Affairs, an independent group. Prof Bohnett said the report was commissioned to inform a government decision on whether to continue increasing unemployment benefits. An online consultation is being conducted until September 23rd.	0
After all his tough talk against the Islamic State, President Obama decided to show some humility by visiting the Vatican — a bold move from a president who has rarely shown a sense of humor. Obama was not the only American sitting down with Pope Francis. The White House invited Pope John Paul III, 80 years old and the most popular leader in the world, for a meeting to discuss social issues in light of the recent global refugee crisis. The American delegation was so overwhelmed by Francis's hospitality they needed to retreat to a VIP apartment for privacy. The Obamas and the pope have already had a tense relationship over Cuba and their shared faith about climate change, which Francis has called "the biggest environmental crisis of our time." The pope recently met with U.S. Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, whose immigration position he agrees with. And at the Vatican, the Vatican is already planning several events for Obama's visit. The president's visit will come nine days before Congress meets in secret to consider extending new and harsher sanctions on Russia and Iran to punish Russia for meddling in the U.S. elections last year. Obama has accused Russia of trying to interfere in the elections and has accused Moscow of wanting to turn Syria into an "Isis"-style Islamic state. The U.S. imposed sanctions last week after a series of Russian airstrikes to support pro-government troops. Last fall, Francis called the Ukraine crisis a battle "between good and evil" and warned Ukraine to fight "not just against the bandits who occupy parts of the country … but also against an international banking system that is destroying the environment and the global economy." Francis, who has been the pope for 27 years, has been known to show genuine warmth toward both political leaders. In May 2014 he blessed President Barack Obama during the pope's visit to the White House and had an exchange with Obama at the White House. Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2fEQwJf	0
I have one of those computers where everything just works. Even when I turn off the keyboard. This laptop ran the Windows XP and the latest Windows Vista through Windows 7, and the only issue I had was that my USB port would not work all the time and I had to unplug it for a short period, but I was fine afterwards. The only problem was the battery would usually die before the processor overheated. I bought a new one, but for about $50. The laptop is not very good for gaming, it gets slow and won't keep running fast while playing games and it is only good for work and light stuffs. I am getting another one anyway though. More	0

FORTUNE — The first day of school was last October. The kids in my neighborhood in Arlington, Virginia were off to pre-cal, and the adults I invited over to spend the afternoon eating hot dogs and drinking beer were waiting for something. What had they been waiting for? I asked. No time to talk. No time to figure things out, they said. "We're going for it," was my answer to every inquiry. What was the game? Why do I care? This was the moment I knew I was going to be a mom. The thing I've wanted. And the moment I knew I was going to keep going. It's been two years since I first knew I wanted, and it really was a life changing experience. To be able to provide for my children and see them grow up meant so much to me. It meant a lot; it means the best. Today, I don't want to just provide for my kids. I want to change and improve things in my life. Because I know I'm going be a mom for the rest of my life. You see that every day in your own life: what you value, why you work so hard, and what you can do now to live a healthier, more fulfilling life. As long as I continue to live in a state of self-doubt and struggle, every single day, I'll be unhappy, and I won't be able to enjoy life. It's hard to do something that doesn't come naturally to you, like creating a business. I've struggled with my ideas and ideas for some time. Even when you're confident in your abilities, the idea of starting a business sounds daunting to some people. But if you let yourself feel confident enough to give up, you'll be surprised with how quickly you're able to realize you're wrong. If you're willing to give up, you can create a beautiful business in no time. And if you're not? You'll find out you never had it in you, you'll find out life is a little more complicated than you ever let on, and you'll feel like failure. "When you see someone in your life who has a great work ethic, who you don't see being an entrepreneur who never gets a break, then you have to say, 'That's OK. That doesn't have to be me,'" says Jennifer, a mother of four with a master's degree in psychology and a post-graduate master's in international development. "Just the way I am — and that's OK. It's OK to have that struggle." Of course, it's OK to have a struggle, to lose faith, to fail, to fall behind in school, and to feel like you're never going to be good at something. But you don't have to be like that. You can be confident in your work, in your ideas, in your vision of what you want to do for the rest of your life. Don't give in to doubt. Just have the courage to keep going. I know exactly what it feels like to wonder why you have to suffer for a dream you think is so great. You dream big things. Don't give up. Don't let insecurity and fear stop you from reaching your goals or changing for the better. I know it's hard, but you're not helpless. If you're willing to give up some comfort and comfort that you've enjoyed so much, you're able to take responsibility for living a life that's more fulfilling, that's more interesting, and that you're proud of. If I keep working hard and keeping the dreams I create alive, I won't forget why I started working in the first place: for my children. I won't forget that I created something, even if the product was not the product that makes money for me, for now or for the foreseeable future. I'll feel good about what I've done, and I'll be able to tell my kids — and my children's kids — about me, and about how much I love them for being my children. I'm ready to move away from being self-critical and looking back at my failures and my failures and feeling regret, and to do whatever it takes to get things done so I can be proud of each day I get to live. I'm ready to help others, and I'm tired of people feeling sorry for me because I want to provide for my kids. I want to be a mom and a good one. And, hopefully, I can help inspire you all to become your goals. NOW WATCH: A scientist found out the best time of day to have sex  NOW WATCH: Innovations That Changed The World	0
The two women who came under attack in the wake of a controversial white supremacist rally in Charlottesville were hit by a car and are expected to survive, despite serious injuries, officials told The Washington Post on Sunday. The unidentified victims, 22-year-old Heather Heyer and 32-year-old Virginia State Police Officer Alex Chen, both of Charlottesville, had "a lot of wounds of traumatic nature," according to Virginia State Police spokeswoman Corinne Geller. But Geller, who would not name what the injuries were or give a time frame, said she did not know if the suspects in the double murder are still on the loose. Hector Jimenez III, 23, who is charged with driving a stolen car driven by Daniel Borden, 20, has a prior arrest for assaulting a woman, a misdemeanor, according to Charlottesville Police spokeswoman Esteban Flores. James Alex Fields, 20, was arrested and charged with second-degree murder and injuries to a minor in the crash that killed Heyer and injured 26 others. On Saturday, in the days after the rally, a white man, who police have said used his car to intentionally strike protesters and then himself, killed Heyer. On Sunday, the police spokesperson said the attack occurred at at 5:15 p.m. Saturday and included a suspect intentionally driving into a group of marchers. She did not say where or how the suspects ran people down. "At that point, there was a group of protesters that had assembled and were walking north. The suspect intentionally drove in front of the group of marchers, causing those that were present to come to a complete stop, and struck and killed Heather Heyer," the spokesperson said. The Virginia governor tweeted that there would be a memorial service Monday in Charlottesville for the murdered activist, but said it would not be a counterprotest organized by members of white nationalist groups. "The governor wants this service to take place at a time and a place of our own choosing. The governor believes that now is the time for unity and civility. We want to allow the families of Heather Heyer and of many others who were injured in this senseless act of domestic terrorism, to have their day in court to present their claims against the individuals who committed this heinous crime," the governor said. The White House condemned the terrorist attack and offered "condolences to the families and friends of Heather Heyer." "The president said too many things yesterday that made clear he wants this story to end right now," said Kellyanne Conway, counselor to the president for policy. Trump's tweets Saturday about the Charlottesville violence, which he blamed on both Antifa and "many sides," drew scrutiny and anger from opponents and supporters who saw the president's comments as a step back on his criticism of racism and violent protests during the 2016 presidential campaign. Trump also was criticized for his initial remarks after Charlottesville, in which the president blamed "many sides" instead of specifically naming white supremacists. A day after the attack, Charlottesville Mayor Michael Signer was criticized by the Virginia State Police for not speaking out about the racist message that he said stood out among the marchers before the attack. Signer said later Sunday that the white supremacists had "rejected the very idea that they were racists." "The fact that someone who said that today and who marched with those white supremacists is so politically correct it's hard to take anymore of his bulls---," Signer told CNN's Brooke Baldwin. He said the message of hate was wrong and expressed concern that the racist messages were "getting louder." "I'm concerned for their safety, for their families' safety, for the safety of this community that was so hurt by that kind of hateful propaganda and message," said the mayor, who also said he would welcome Attorney General Jeff Sessions to the city. During her news conference, Mayor Signer said the violence is an example of the hatred "that we don't want to repeat." He said the town's new leadership will work with other local communities to fight racism. "I'll do whatever I can to help, to give voice to, to stand up against hatred and bigotry. I'm very hopeful that these things don't happen again. And we're not going to tolerate that in our community." Heyer is a graduate of Virginia Tech and was working as a nurse practitioner at her university medical center when she was killed. A photo from Heyer was among a series of images of victims of Saturday's attack that were displayed in the Newseum in Washington on Monday. Among the victims were two Virginia State Police troopers killed in a helicopter crash and former Marine Dillon Taylor, 20, who was killed when a car slammed into a crowd of counterprotesters in Charlottesville. According to New York Times, Heyer was one of a small group of counterprotesters on the wrong side of some of the	0
[Updated at 11 a.m. ET] A major US television network is investigating claims that the Israeli Defense Forces are deliberately targeting Palestinian civilians with the Palestinian territories as the "Israeli occupied territories." [Updated at 11 a.m. ET] An initial investigation has been launched and will examine two separate incidents. [Updated at 10 p.m. ET] Three people in the West Bank have already been treated for injuries suffered under the Israeli occupation. The Palestinian Red Crescent says there are about 120 wounded people. Medical sources have said there are many serious injuries. [Updated at 10:40 p.m. ET] Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has announced that he will hold an emergency security meeting at 10 a.m. ET. [Updated at 10:30 p.m. ET] The White House said that it welcomes Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's decision to convene an emergency meeting to review the situation in the West Bank. [Updated at 10:25 p.m. ET] US President Barack Obama's national security adviser, Susan Rice, is calling the situation "toughness on strength." "We have seen some really dramatic action on the part of Mr. Netanyahu, and that is exactly how a leader should respond in a time like this," said Rice on MSNBC on Wednesday night. "You've got a situation where the prime minister of Israel, a leader you're supposed to be able to trust is attacking and punishing his own population. But we're going to continue to support, encourage and work with the people of the West Bank to find a peaceful compromise that respects the security of Israel. "Our core interest in the region is to have a stable Palestinian state, and we believe that both sides have to work together to address this issue and ensure that Gaza will not be returned and that they get the help they need for the long haul, but a two-state solution is the path forward," she said. [Updated at 10:00 p.m. ET] A Palestinian security official said five Palestinians were shot dead and five wounded in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. The official told Al Jazeera that the attack took place in the city of Qalqilya, near Bethlehem, in the southern West Bank. [Updated at 9:45 p.m. ET] US Secretary of State John Kerry says the Netanyahu government should stop the Israeli military from carrying out "tactical operations and targeting the civilian population of the West Bank." This comes after the Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) conducted live fire drills against Palestinian civilians from their headquarters just outside of the Palestinian-ruled territories' capital of Ramallah, a Reuters eyewitness reported. The Israeli army claimed that their aim was "to test" its equipment and that they were merely conducting a drill. [Updated at 9:20 p.m. ET] Israeli officials are now reporting that their soldiers shot a Palestinian man in the head when he fired at security forces.

"We have seen some really dramatic action on the part of the prime minister of Israel, and that is exactly how a leader should respond in a time like this." He said he supports the decision of his security cabinet to hold an emergency security meeting and will do so "in the coming hours" at his initiative. "[The cabinet] will not be held as a show of force. This is a decision made to review what has gone wrong and to seek to achieve long-overdue results," he said. "Israel must be able to defend itself from its enemies. Israel needs to be able to stand with itself and to say we stand and believe in our future." [Updated at 8:56 p.m. ET] An Israeli official has said that "in a very few hundred meters" the country's ground forces "may fire live ammunition and the air force may have a role in it." It can be heard on Israeli Channel 10's military coverage. [Updated at 8:52 p.m. ET] Israeli security forces have "shot at terrorists from Israeli police units" who fired at them with "materiel," the Israeli army said. It added that officers from Jerusalem's police force were among those who fired. [Updated at 8:41 p.m. ET] Netanyahu has called on Arab leaders to condemn the Israeli attack on the West Bank, which he said was a response to Palestinian violence. [Updated at 8:36 p.m. ET] Hamas has slammed "the despicable attack" and called for the "international community to condemn the bloodlust and the murder of children and civilians in the settlements."	0
A U.S. Navy veteran who was a former Green Beret commander says he was harassed by an airline employee who called him a "traitor" and threatened to "blow me sky high." Robert Bales has filed a lawsuit against American Airlines and American Eagle over alleged discrimination. He was removed from his flight from Las Vegas to Detroit on November 22, 2010. Bales said the incident prompted him to quit the military; one month later, he flew his new plane again to Detroit. He said a flight attendant stopped him to ask him "if he had any bad thoughts or feelings" toward the airline. American Airlines has denied the flight incident occurred on American Eagle flights, saying Bales' story "is nothing more than a fabrication" and a "clear case of fraud." The airline also has asked the court to find that the complaints against Bales "are completely without merit." "He's trying do everything within his power to get out there and get in with other people, the next step is to go through social media to try and get other people to help him," Bales' attorney David Estrada said. "He's going to have to have some new, better friends." The lawsuit claims that Bales was removed from American Eagle because, "Aircraft crew member #1 had reasonable cause to believe that [Bales] was a 'threat to other airline crew member safety or security.'" "American Eagle knew that he had a violent history with TSA and was known to have a violent temper," the lawsuit states. In an interview with CBS Detroit, Bales said he was removed because the airline believed him to be a threat to aviation security. "American Eagle had reasonable and probable cause to believe that he had threatened, intimidated, and/or assaulted a flight attendant," the suit states. The suit also claims that Bales was dismissed because he had served 22 years as a U.S. Army Special Forces soldier and the airline needed to get rid of him first. "American Eagle knew that if he did not complete his service at the U.S. Army Special Forces School, he would be discharged from the military," the suit states. The airline does not dispute the accusations. In a statement released through a company attorney, the carrier said that the complaint "is completely without merit," and accuses Bales of attempting to get "under the skin of American Eagle" to "pursue his own personal agenda of getting back into the Air Line industry". Bales served as a co-pilot for American Eagle and United Airlines before he was demoted. "When asked about his history of discipline and disciplinary action, Mr. Bales admitted to some minor problems in the Air Force that he took seriously," the company's statement said. "Since his discharge in 2002, he has served for 22 years, has never been arrested, has never been convicted of the crimes he is now alleging, and has never been accused or charged with a serious crime in this or any other country. Mr. Bales has no credibility whatsoever." In his lawsuit, Bales details what happened after he was removed from his first flight, on November 22, 2010. The suit alleges that Bales suffered emotional distress and mental anguish of $400,000 and is seeking damages and an injunction requiring the release of audio recordings and emails to his attorneys. Bales also filed a whistleblower complaint with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration for alleged civil rights violations related to the alleged incident. The OIG office is investigating the issue. The suit alleges that Bales' military service prevented him from pursuing a civilian job, but the airline insists it did nothing wrong. Bales' lawsuit comes the same day that a former Delta Air Lines flight attendant filed a proposed class action lawsuit against the carrier alleging that a supervisor "intimidated" her by telling her "to keep her mouth shut because he would 'break' her." The attorney representing the flight attendant, William Cavanaugh, claims his client was forced to resign and threatened with legal action with the assistance of Delta's CEO when her refusal to work for the airline "took away work" on her schedule. "I hope this lawsuit will put some pressure on Delta Air Lines, because I think their policies are unlawful," said Cavanaugh. Copyright 2012 by ClickOnDetroit.com. All rights reserved.

D.C. has the highest rate of marijuana use in the world, a D.C. Council committee decided at an emergency subcommittee session Thursday evening. A study commissioned by the D.C. City Council concluded that marijuana use was the leading cause of disability in the District with nearly one in four people ages 16 to 29 reporting having used some form of marijuana in the last year. The subcommittee voted 10 to 6, with Council Chairman Phil Mendelson (D) absent, not to recommend the decriminalization of the drug. Committee members instead requested that the city make better efforts to deal with marijuana use, and urged council members to consider the effects a policy change could have on the District's homeless population. The subcommittee voted to hold a public hearing on the study at a later date.	0

In the shocking clip, five people can be seen surrounding a soldier who was on a training exercise. At one point a man can be seen appearing to grab one of his testicles. He is also seen dragging one of the soldiers by his arm across the floor, as people get increasingly agitated. Police confirmed they received a call after 5pm that reported a soldier had tried to harm himself but denied Israeli media reports about a soldier being attacked with iron bars. (Image: Israel Police) A large group of men, some of them wearing military uniforms, have then surrounded the soldier, before they are caught by the dog walker. The video, which first emerged on social media, shows people throwing punches, trying to snatch the soldier, and screaming and swearing at him. (Image: Israel Police) "Take this guy!" one man said as he tries to grab the soldier's testicles, which were on the floor outside his boot. "Get that soldier. Throw him over. Throw him over!" He then grabs the soldier by his arm, pulling him across the floor near the corner of the street. Several people can be seen restraining the soldier as another man runs in with a camera. (Image: Israel Police) One of the soldiers can be seen on crutches. He later told police he didn't know why anyone was after him or why he was attacked. The police were looking for three people believed to have been involved in the incident, but a military spokesperson said they were not currently involved in an investigation.

A woman in northern Minnesota who allegedly refused to leave a store with a family on a Valentine's Day break got more than she bargained for when she suddenly grabbed a customer's ear after realizing she was in the wrong place. The incident at the Gander Mountain Store, near Fort Snelling, began when a family had been in the store for just three minutes, said Lt. Bob Kroll of the Hennepin County Sheriff's Office. The woman, identified as 34-year-old Lillian Ziegler of Gander, apparently had no idea she was in the wrong place, Kroll said. Instead of walking away, Ziegler allegedly grabbed the ear of a woman she apparently thought was her son after they became separated while returning to the store. When the woman began to run away, Ziegler pursued her, pulled her down from the aisles and began hitting her on the back with a bottle, Kroll said in a news release issued Thursday. The woman was able to break free and then flagged down a clerk before leaving the store. Ziegler was able to get her purse from the woman and was later arrested. She was arrested for disorderly conduct and interfering with an officer, according to the news release. The Hennepin County Sheriff's Office has not yet said how the ear was found, Kroll said.	0
Monsanto's own documents confirm that GMO wheat has caused cancer. (It also showed that this cancer caused more than $7 billion in sales for the company.) By now you've probably heard about what Monsanto recently confirmed to Canadian regulatory authority MON-SA: genetically modified wheat has caused "an increase in the overall incidence of non-small cell lung cancer in a subset of rats fed the treated wheat." What's even scarier is that MON-SA told Monsanto to conduct a study on the effect of their product on human beings. (See "Bayer Must Be Stopped", May/June 2011.) The MON-SA statement confirmed this cancer study to Canadian authorities because Monsanto had already requested the federal regulatory agency to allow the company access to their animal feeding studies. The federal agency agreed, after Monsanto was unable to produce the animals. MON-SA also confirmed Monsanto's earlier report that glyphosate (aka Roundup) caused infertility in rats and female mice. However, not only has Monsanto not conducted and publicly released the test data proving its GM wheat is the cause of cancer in humans, the company lied for nearly two years about it. It lied about the health effects of GMOs, because the company has no health concerns on GMOs except what Monsanto itself can show. How Did Monsanto Lie? When the MON-SA statement was made public on May 11, the company claimed that the company would publish a revised data set that would show that GM wheat had no significant effect on the health of humans or animals. This claim appears to have been just another blatant lie. As explained below, MON-SA, the Canadian regulatory agency, has a stated policy that all data must be transparent, accurate, and unbiased, and all new data must be peer-reviewed by independent scientists. So, the data must be accurate, correct, and unbiased. And Monsanto knew that for nearly two years. So the company knew the data was false (and, as we've discussed, it still is). What about the test data Monsanto claimed to produce? And the data that Monsanto had lied about for two years? These data were available to MON-SA: GMO wheat has caused a dramatic increase in an animal organism that can cause infertility in humans and cause tumors in both animals and humans. These data were available because Monsanto asked MON-SA to approve its GM wheat for human feeding. When the U.S. FDA found these data to be "inconclusive" as it should have had, MON-SA refused to approve the company's approval and rejected the test data. What has Monsanto done with the data now that it had already provided to MON-SA for approval? Was it destroyed? Was it destroyed in any other way? And where is the data from MON-SA's GMO wheat experiment currently? Months after MON-SA approved Monsanto's GMO wheat (which it had never actually analyzed), its Health Canada division told Monsanto to conduct the cancer study. However, this study does not show that glyphosate caused these cancerous tumors in rats and female mice: In fact, the MON-SA statement contradicts this conclusion. The statement says that the cancer cells that the rats and mice had were genetically engineered to become resistant to glyphosate, so the animals and humans were also genetically engineered to become resistant. So, MON-SA lied to the feds and lied about the results of its own research to help Monsanto get Monsanto's patent renewal. What about Monsanto's statements that glyphosate is already recognized as causing cancer and infertility in humans? According to MON-SA, a number of scientific bodies have recognized glyphosate as causing these effects in the animals the company tested. However, MON-SA still ignored this conclusion by the Canadian regulatory agency. Monsanto continues to assert that there is a difference between humans and animals, and therefore the risks that it believes glyphosate poses to animals are different from the risks posed to humans. As a result, Monsanto ignores the public health risks posed by GE foods, while it protects its own patent, and continues to increase the use of Monsanto's genetically engineered crops across the globe.

And, if that is not enough, many other countries (and Canada itself) have already banned GMOs. I would encourage you to call your representatives to stop this dangerous experimentation in the name of profits and power.	0
We've all had these moments in the store, where we'd come up to a stack of clothes or some other item and think, "Oh! I really like this! It might even be wearable for summer!" But what you don't really know is that the item, at least at that stage in its life cycle, is not "good enough," in the sense of being wearable for summer yet. After all, you've only got to think back to the summer of 2001 when The Gap first introduced their second line of "classic" jeans with skinny fit legs, and they were immediately hailed by the fashion establishment and fashion bloggers as a model for new ideas in the fashion world. "They were a perfect way to show you have fun with this whole slimmed down, sporty thing," says Jessica Kann , whose own career has been built on helping young designers, and even older ones, get their start in the industry. "They have these classic-to-modern silhouettes, and if you could only wear one of those things, this would be it." And as it happens, those skinny jeans were a perfect example of that type of modern slimming. In fact, they're so reminiscent of the Gap's original line, there's an entire clothing line (now known as the Gap Jeans Collection ) that's all about the same thing: a modern style of slim fit jeans with very tight or skinny leg openings. It's a kind of retro throwback for the modern clothing world. And so, with the idea of "slim fit" jeans and pants gaining prominence across the fashion landscape, you might be thinking, "Okay! I know what a skinny fit is!" But you're not quite prepared to do some of the hard leg work to really understand what those words actually mean. To answer: "Slim Fit" jeans are simply a variation on the basic slim jean cut that has a small leg opening and/or a thigh gap that is very close to or at the waist. "Slim Fit" pants are meant to be casual wear, so they are not meant to be wearing underneath another layer of clothing (although that can be a really creative way of using your jeans—try tying them around your waist to bring the hip fit into play). So what's the problem with "slim fit"? It's more appropriate to say that jeans that don't meet a certain standard of fit are not "slim fit," because a more casual, everyday, fit can be just as good. But when it comes to jeans-as-accessories, some of us forget this, and we think we need to have some "slim" fit just to make sure we look good. "The problem with skinny fits is that they are too fitted because the thigh gap and overall leg and waist is too small," explains Kann. "If the leg opening is a fraction of an inch wider your pants will look too tight, it won't drape well over your thighs or your hips, which can sometimes make them look baggy. And the leg opening won't be that great, it will be very small and you'll be very uncomfortable. And sometimes just making the leg opening a fraction wider than what you normally need is all it takes to make a pair of jeans be more fitted. It's not about fit, but about the balance of your body, how you are sitting and standing at that moment. And the right pair of jeans will be a blend of the two, with the leg opening being just enough to cover your thigh but not so much that there's gaping around your hips and a lot of leg and waist gap. It's really about making sure the shape is right."	0
It's the final countdown to WrestleMania 34. We're getting into the last month of the year with a ton of news about the biggest event in pro wrestling. There's lots in store on Sunday night, but before we get into that, we present a new version of our Best Of 2015 awards. WrestleMania is one of the biggest annual events on the wrestling calendar, but every year there is a new winner (or, at least, a new winner on our list). Here at the SB Nation office, we give out this awards on the last Saturday of the year, and the process is fairly simple. On the same date, I run an all-day online poll to pick our top 10 (which has to include three candidates), and then I run the results through a weighted algorithm to determine the winners—usually five different winners. It's a good way to highlight where we stand in the year, but it also highlights which guys we'd like to have seen win this year. And so: I had our staff vote for their top five choice for the awards of 2014. These are not necessarily the top contenders for the next year's award, just my picks for the guys likely to take it next year. So, without further ado… here's SB Nation's Best Of 2015 awards. Feel free to share them with your friends and followers. Farewells The year came to a close with a final tribute to the best of the best. The winners of our Best Of 2015 awards are listed below: SB Nation Best Of 2015 Winner, Wrestling Observer Newsletter Best Of 2015 Winner, Wrestlezone Best Of 2015 Winner, Wrestling INC. Best Of 2015 Winner, Wrestling Inc. Staff Picks Best Of 2015 Winner, PWTorch Best of 2014 Winner, Pro Wrestling Torch Best of 2014 Winner, Wrestling Observer Newsletter 2012 Award 2012 Winner, Wrestling Observer Newsletter Best of 2012 Winners of this year's award are now being listed, by award, at the top of this page. WrestleMania 34 This year's event in Tampa was a huge one for the company as it brought in some of the biggest stars and most popular superstars to date. The main event was the first WWE World Heavyweight Championship match since John Cena lost it last December. The reigning champion came out to music from Michael Jackson's Bad, a song that WWE fans (and particularly its young fans) have embraced for its references to the dark side and the potential power of the belt, and the crowd exploded. Cena was the obvious standout, as he was a fan favorite from the moment he joined the company. He and Randy Orton, who came off a shocking victory over The Wyatt Family at the Royal Rumble, looked good, and The New Day looked more or less the same—for whatever reason, they were in the ring and looked like they would win by default. For the first time at a WrestleMania, we got to see the return of CM Punk after an almost decade of inactivity, and although his performance, even without the massive mic work and pyro from the WWE, was great, he was still not the main event. The other main event featured John Cena, Big Show (although there will be debate about whether it was the correct choice of opponent given the size disparity that the champ and his opponent had, a factor that can often make the outcome of a match hard to predict) and Braun Strowman. Cena seemed to have no problems getting through the match—especially with the help of his finishers—but Strowman looked terrible, especially as they went into the match, when a knee and elbow injury kept him out of action earlier in the year during his return to the company. Cena and Show worked well as a tag team; it almost felt like the former WWE champion was the leader, and his aggression almost carried him through to victory. Strowman, although very good in the match, was clearly a step out of his comfort zone, and despite the crowd's reaction, it seems probable that he'll look to change his style to try to get over and be successful in WWE. WWE World Heavyweight Champion John Cena defeated Rusev by submission (rear naked choke) to retain the WWE World Heavyweight Championship, WWE on WWE Network, 4.2 out of 5 stars I'll be back next year to celebrate the end of another year of sports-entertainment coverage, and we'll probably take the Best Of 2015 awards one more time at that point.	0
The New York Times reported "Republicans have already raised millions," and the Washington Post added that it was "on pace to be the biggest-ever Republican fundraising quarter for any presidential candidate." So what exactly is this huge money surge? It's largely to win the battle for the superdelegates. As I noted, the first two states to vote, South Carolina and Nevada, have a significant number of superdelegates. The superdelegates (who were all but ignored on Super Tuesday) will pick the nominee, regardless of the popular vote, which is why Super Tuesday has become so important. If Donald Trump could win the majority of the delegates, he would have a lock on the nomination. But given how poorly Ted Cruz and John Kasich performed during their campaigns, he'll need to flip a lot more delegates in order to clinch the nomination. That's why these results are so important for the Republican Party, as the nomination could go to either candidate (at some point Cruz'll have to take him down). The only way to guarantee that is by winning the superdelegates. But with more than a week to go before the election, the polls show Trump just barely ahead of Hillary Clinton nationally. The big money influx will be from the Super PAC side (the Koch Brothers are already in it, according to the Wall Street Journal), and the GOP Party itself. The Hill reports that the GOP is expected to raise more than $100 million. The Koch brothers are expected to kick in $20 million, and the Republican Governors association is set to pay $7 million to help states run more competitive primary and caucus processes. The RNC will take in $11 million. The National Republican Congressional Committee, a political advocacy group that spent millions to defend Republican House and Senate incumbents, will give $2.9 million. In short, the Republicans have already spent what would be considered huge sums on the political war at this point in a presidential election. They seem to have made their decision to focus on "winning" rather than "preserving" the Republican Party as long as Trump is the nominee. I wonder if the Washington Post, which is a generally liberal outlet, felt the same way after Mitt Romney lost in 2012.	0
I've made this recipe for several people but a few of them found it bland. I'm sure they would've liked it better if I'd had the time to put the flavors to better use. In case it's needed, I'd suggest adding a few more slices of lemon into this for extra punch. This is a bit more complicated than the basic lemon cake recipe. The original recipe calls for a whole egg but you can sub an uncooked egg with a yolk. However, be sure to use an egg that's cooked well! The cake itself can be made in an 8×8" round cake pan or in a 6–8 inch square muffin tin. I'd suggest using a 6 x 9" or 8 x 11" circular measuring cup to pour in the batter. I find it easier to pour about one cup in from the top than to try to get all the batter in the container. This way I can flip the pan if necessary and still get all of it. The batter should be about 1 inch thick. I put mine in the cup on the top and let them freeze. When I cut the cake into individual servings I do this with the muffin cup underneath the first slice to try to keep from losing too much batter! The cake is best eaten right away after frosting, but it also makes delicious leftovers. The frosting is a one-bowl process. It requires a bit of elbow grease and patience. You will need to add more eggs if necessary so it's not super runny when it hardens. You can keep the frosting chilled in the fridge for several days and re-heat it as needed. This is a great quick, sweet dessert that you can make this afternoon and take to a potluck with your friends.	0
Brisbane Roar FC are pleased to announce the re-signing of forward Jack Hingert for the 2013/14 Hyundai A-League season. Hingert has agreed a one-year contract extension to continue his career at Brisbane Roar, after being granted his club-record contract for the 2013/14 season by executive general manager David Pourre. "It's been a difficult few years for Jack, with a number of injuries and then a transfer to England," said Pourre. "It's great to see him back in the Roar outfit with a fresh start. "He's a good character; the kind of guy who wants to perform for the Roar and he'll want to finish the year, hopefully, as champion of the flag." Hingert's arrival will come as good news for Roar Head Coach, John Aloisi, who will be hoping to re-sign his second-choice forward when the transfer market opens later this week. "I have a feeling Jack will want to extend his time with us," continued Aloisi. "I've had a number of good chats with him and obviously I'm sure there will be some negotiations that will come about that will have to happen between him and his family." Hingert, 24, has been an integral part of Roar's midfield over the past two seasons, scoring 10 goals in all competitions during the 2013/14 A-League season, including the most in the competition during last season with five goals and seven assists. The versatile forward has made 25 appearances for the Roar in all competitions since joining the Hyundai A-League in June 2008. "I've had three seasons in Brisbane, I am a local boy and it's great to be back with my family over there," said Jack Hingert, who played his first official game for Brisbane at the Hyundai A-League's match against Melbourne Victory at Suncorp Stadium in April. "I have always wanted to stay in Brisbane and this is an exciting next chapter for me." The Englishman joined Brisbane Roar for a reported three million Australian dollars, following his release from Manchester City this January. Hingert scored five goals in 16 appearances for City last season.	0
I've been in a dark and depressing place since getting my new bike on the day it arrived. I was planning to use this as my only bike and go back to riding my two bikes, but things have changed now and I have decided to stick it out. Now, that said, I'm pretty happy about the purchase. This is the first bike I've really liked to ride. It feels solid, it has the gears to get me all the way around town (on medium) and the tires have excellent grip without bogging me down.  I started the process of building this up on the second day. It started out as a standard mountain bike frame with a frame bag (for my bike, but you can use it on this as well). It started out as a bike for my son. He loves riding bicycles and is a little younger, but this is a perfect bike to help out my other little boys who are now old enough to ride around town. The little wheels are perfect for both his and my needs. But I noticed that there was a huge gap between the gears on this bike. So I bought a set of 11 speed pedals, added a shifter and started thinking about what I would do without the gears.  I then decided that perhaps a rear-center-drive system like the BBS02 is great at what it does. So I spent more time building this bike, using the BBS02 as a guide, and figured that by removing the drive rear wheel and rear derailleur and replacing everything with a rear center drive I could get a good set of gears without losing any speed. So we spent a couple of hours on the bike and at about 10:30pm on the fifth day had a completely working working ride with the new gears. I love this bike! When I'm out on the bike path and the roads are clear I really enjoy cruising at 10mph, going faster or slower depending on what I need to do at the time. I got a few "Wow's" but I haven't noticed any issues yet with using this bike.  I'm going to do a separate review on my new bike later in the week, and I'll update this with the details, because this bike has been a blast. The only changes that I've made to how I use the bike are that I removed the front wheel to have a more stable setup for the pedals. It was worth it; I can now get up to speed easily on the bike path with the pedals and it feels completely stable now!  The biggest reason I'm writing this is because it's so important to me that people like my reviews! If I could reach more people, and more like-minded people with this bike this would be a real success. I just want to encourage everyone to give this a try and see for themselves, and I truly think that it's worth it.	0
D.C. Police Chief Cathy Lanier. (Photo by Bill O'Leary/The Washington Post) The National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund is releasing another of its big-name cops lists, and D.C. gets a huge shout-out. The "Top 10 Best-Dressed DC Police" list, released Thursday, ranked D.C. cops according to their fashion sense. (D.C. was not on the previous list by the fund.) Chief Cathy Lanier, who has become something of the fashionista herself, came in at No. 1. Police Officer William Miller, who heads up District's homicide squad and works in the District's D.C. Sheriff's Office, came in at No. 2. According to the NLEOMF list, DC had a total of 50 police officers who appeared on the list — two were not on the previous list — plus an additional 19 who appeared on a separate list. "As we commemorate the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund's 50th Anniversary, we honor the hard work and sacrifice that law enforcement officers around the country and around the world have made, and continue to make," NLEOMF President and CEO Mike Lopez said. "For many more years to come, we will continue to honor their names by highlighting their outstanding achievements, achievements in their communities, and a dedication to protecting the public and our nation." In case you can't believe it, here's the full list: 1. Nellie B. Lanier Chief, D.C. Police Department 2. James D. Miller Supervisory Deputy Chief, District's Homicide Homicide Squad 3. Thomas P. Burke, Jr. District's Assistant Chief of Police 4. John W. Fulkerson, III Supervisory Detective, D.C. Homicide Homicide Squad 5. Frank W. Covington III District's Special Patrol Officer 6. John R. Fetterman D.C.'s Sergeant of Arms & Treasurer 7. James G. DeMent Supervisory Detective, D.C. Homicide Homicide Squad 8. William Z. Burt District's Sergeant of Arms and Treasurer 9. Stephen F. Harges III District's Sergeant of Arms and Treasurer 10. Frank S. Nalepa, III District's Sheriff Here are a few more things to note: • In his District's Homicide Homicide Squad, Officer William Miller earned the top-rated uniform rating, of "A." • Among DC's homicide detectives, Special Patrol Officer Stephen F. Harges III scored "A" for wearing a "business casual business suit," although there was no "sporting a business suit" rating in the list. • Among DC's homicide detectives, Deputy Chief William Z. Burt scored a high-scoring "A" in "A" clothing, which "may include traditional suits, traditional shirts and ties, and sport coats." The other officers who scored "A" included: • Senior Master Sergeant James G. DeMent, "A" clothing, a term the NLEOMF describes as "the color, style, and style of appearance with regard to appearance that is most typical of persons displaying leadership skills and authority by displaying appropriate attitudes, mannerisms, and body language." (The term means "inoffensive, well-dressed, and clean.") • Sergeant Edward J. Thomas, "A" clothing, a term the NLEOMF describes as "the color, style, and style of appearance with regard to appearance that is most typical of persons displaying leadership skills and authority by displaying appropriate attitudes, mannerisms, and body language." • Police Patrol Lieutenant George L. K. Pippin, "A" clothing, a term the NLEOMF describes as "the color, style, and style of appearance with regard to appearance that is most typical of persons displaying leadership skills and authority by displaying appropriate attitudes, mannerisms, and body language." (The term means "appearance that conforms to standards of cleanliness and good manners.") • Sgt. Michael D. Purdy, "A" clothing, a term the NLEOMF describes as "the color, style, and style of appearance with regard to appearance that is most typical of persons displaying leadership skills and authority by displaying appropriate attitudes, mannerisms, and body language."	0
As long as everyone is in good standing for two weeks, you can pay a portion of your monthly or yearly membership dues or membership fees. This is useful if you are in the market for a new bike or a new equipment that meets your needs at a lower cost. You will not have to pay again during the course of your membership. You can find the dues or membership fees tab at the bottom of the membership page. You can pay online or in person in our office or at the Bike Shop. For new members under 18, you will need to provide a parent's/legal guardian's (18+ year old) consent in order to pay dues. You may also obtain this consent from the parent/legal guardian when your 18th birthday is approaching by providing it in writing. If your membership is being paid automatically or in installments, there is a "Monthly Fees" checkbox you may check on the Membership Information tab of the registration form to indicate you want you monthly dues (or annual dues), monthly installment payment, or any combination thereof. You must indicate the appropriate payment type. If you are paying the monthly enrollment fee you will also receive a statement in the mail at the time of the enrollment period. In order to provide the most comprehensive cycling education, the department has established various membership dues levels for various ages and abilities and for individuals, families, and groups. Learn more about membership dues. What is a "Rental Membership?" Please be aware that there are no official policies that define what is a "rental", but the definition of rental often includes someone "renting" bicycles. Renting means the person (or business) renting/leasing the bikes is making money off the rental process by charging customers a lower price than the bikes would normally be sold for. Most times, you can buy a pair of reasonably used and quality bicycles at the normal price for that model in the stores. It is illegal in Chicago to offer rental bikes unless the bicycles being rented are being resold, so most of the bikes are sold at regular prices. The same goes for rental, but the bikes are being used by the customer and not just stored in your garage. The person renting the bicycles may not be a business. For example, if you rent a bicycle from a friend, you're likely not renting the bicycle for profit. But if you rent to a friend, you could be breaking the law, or at a minimum risking a fine. For more information about renting or reselling bicycles, please see the Office of the City Attorney's page on the topic	0
The New York Times says that President Obama's "biggest failure on health care" is his failure to fix the problems of Medicaid, a new entitlement program for the poor. In "Obamacare's Biggest Failure," reporter Jonathan Martin notes that while the Obama administration has insisted that Obamacare would cut spending and improve access to health care for low-income people, the program has been far less successful than most of the president's promised savings. He points to a 2014 report by the Commonwealth Fund showing that Medicaid spending is now set to double over the next 10 years. Martin writes: Even with those staggering numbers, [Health and Human Services] Secretary Kathleen Sebelius has repeatedly noted that expanding coverage will still be paid for by the health insurance industry, which receives $1 in tax credits from each premium dollar it spends. And some of those insurers have already begun jacking up premiums to cover the costs of caring for the uninsured, a policy known as "penalties" or "risk corridors." Some of those high-cost patients will likely remain uninsured. If that happens, Mr. Obama's health law could be making the entire program more expensive over what would previously have been its first two years. Obama's health care law is facing increasing criticism from his own party. In October the House overwhelmingly rejected an amended version of the health care law that would have repealed the health insurance subsidies — the part of Obamacare that relies on individuals to purchase their own insurance — and the part requiring employers to provide insurance coverage and that would have cut Medicaid's funding from the existing levels of $385 billion to $162 billion over ten years.	0
A former aide to President Donald Trump offered up a remarkable defense of his boss Wednesday — which we'll excerpt below. "I've never seen anything like this. It's so bizarre," the source told NBC News chief White House correspondent Hallie Jackson. "So many people in the administration now are basically just talking about him, talking about him with no focus on the mission or any other specific agenda for the president of the United States. I believe what's going to happen is that a lot of people who weren't in on the planning of this are going to be in for a surprise." Jackson then told him, "And you think it's inappropriate to be talking only about the president of the United States?" The source replied, "How could a guy be president who doesn't ever even seem concerned by the mission he's supposed to be overseeing?" Trump's first year in office has been defined by political chaos, leaks and questionable actions, from the firing of FBI Director James Comey and other ongoing probes to the hiring and removal of senior White House advisers like Steve Bannon and John Kelly.	0
Ahead of the release of Star Trek 3, JJ Abrams has been doing a great job of setting up a universe for the future. In fact, there is more than enough material to run multiple Trek series and movies on Star Trek's 20th anniversary, just as was the case with Deep Space Nine and Voyager. Abrams has already announced new films for the series and an online Trek documentary is scheduled to air on the anniversary of the television series (June 18). But there is still one item that I haven't heard about—the continuation of Trek Into Darkness. Speaking with Star Trek Magazine about the upcoming feature film, Abrams confirmed that Star Trek Into Darkness isn't going anywhere. But the film is not the only project currently in active development. With the anniversary approaching, I had a chat with Abrams about the next chapter of the Star Trek franchise, including the potential continuation. "I'm gonna be very explicit about this. I don't think we're not doing one more Star Trek," Abrams admitted. "I don't know what we're gonna do on Star Trek 3, 'cause it's kind of like an open question. I don't know if there's an outline to a script. … The story's been in my head forever. So the same thing applies to that. "If and when we do have the opportunity to do the second Star Trek movie, then I think that's definitely going to be the next Star Trek movie." He went on to tease, "I think it'll take place 10, maybe 15 years after, and it'll likely, in a strange way, be a sequel of the first one. I'm not sure." The question then becomes, what story could the sequel explore? "I think the third film is a fun, fun, scary movie," Abrams confirmed. "It's an adventure, because we're going to go to another planet, a new planet, with a story that's kind of an action adventure in many ways." But, if so, where does Phase II fall in that saga? "If and when we do have the opportunity to do the third film, we're gonna have to be really careful in how we approach it," Abrams stated. "If it's a little bit of a change and also a bit of a return to the characters that we've created, then that's something that is really possible." Perhaps not to worry, though. After discussing the next three Star Trek films, he also revealed that Abrams and his fellow writer Rian Johnson would be working on a follow up to the upcoming Star Wars film Rogue One. "As you know, Rian's writing one of the Star Wars movies," Abrams said. "So, it's been his scriptwriting and our conversations." The next Star Trek 3 is currently set for release on May 17, 2017. The movie stars Chris Pine as Kirk, Zachary Quinto as Spock, Zoe Saldana as Uhura, Karl Urban as Bones, Anthony Rapp as a mysterious villain named "Cooper" (as teased in the end credits of Star Trek Into Darkness), John Cho as Sulu, Simon Pegg as Scotty, and Anton Yelchin as Chekov.	0
It is in the area of the brain referred to as the amygdala — a dark, almond-shaped brain structure that helps regulate emotions and is involved in learning — that scientists have been studying the potential of marijuana, a substance widely thought of as a leading contributor to anxiety disorders. So far, they say it is still too soon to know if pot can directly help patients deal with anxiety and depression, but it appears to activate the area of the brain that causes anxiety, making it appear to have some of the same positive effects. "We do not know if it activates the same pathways as a benzodiazepine, but it has been demonstrated by other researchers it works," says David A. Yaffe, a medical scientist at the Medical University of South Carolina and the director of the Carolina-based Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS) in Charleston. "Pot might help patients without causing a negative reaction." Marijuana is a drug that has been used around the world for many years, and its current legal status in some states makes for an unusual cross-disciplinary study of the compound; the drug is a Schedule 1 controlled substance in the United States. Although the substance can sometimes be grown as a plant and sold as an herb for therapeutic purposes, its use as a recreational drug is illegal and banned in most other countries (although in Europe many jurisdictions have moved toward relaxing their stance on the drug). It is also believed to affect the entire nervous system, triggering a range of side-effects. Because of those factors, it may be easy to see why many feel its effects are not quite as benign as many assumed. But with so much controversy surrounding the drug, it's unlikely to get back in the mainstream too soon, even if it works for some. "It is clear that while we learn more about marijuana, there will always still be people who are concerned that its benefits cannot be proven," says Michael Sorensen, who is the principal investigator on a federal grant for MAPS, and has written about the research being conducted in the marijuana field. "While it is possible, there is no guarantee that marijuana will ever be an effective treatment for the majority of patients." Still, it has been suggested that marijuana can actually treat symptoms of anxiety disorders, specifically panic, phobias, and social anxiety; patients with these conditions can also benefit from the use of marijuana. And studies have shown that marijuana's chemical makeup actually helps in the treatment of depression, bipolar disorder, and anxiety. However, marijuana itself does not appear any different than any other drug when it comes to the activity of its primary active ingredient THC (delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol). "It is not a drug like alcohol, opiates, or cocaine," says Yaffe, who is also director of the Neuropsychopharmacology Research Center, University of South Carolina. Yaffe says that THC itself is relatively benign, while its breakdown products, THCA and THB, are the main ingredients in marijuana that lead to its effects. The drug is also found in many plants, from the poppy to the cannabis plant to the eucalyptus plant, among other plants. The fact that these active substances come from various plants doesn't make it any more or less harmful than when they come from one plant-only. Yaffe compares THC and its breakdown products in a similar way to nicotine and its breakdown product, acetylcholine. Both have been discovered by different sources, both naturally occurring and artificially created, and both may cause various effects, including effects that cause the body to produce and release an active substance, Yaffe says. "There is no guarantee that one has any negative impact on the other," he says. "It may all be on the molecular level." There have been hundreds of studies in the medical literature on marijuana since the 1970s, and it has been studied so widely that there has been some debate as to whether or not it is safe. This week, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced its first-ever approval of medical marijuana for treatment of nausea associated with chemotherapy. This month, the FDA has also begun reviewing synthetic marijuana, which is now banned because of the addictive properties. According to data from the Drug Enforcement Administration, marijuana was the third most abused substance in America in 2002, just behind heroin and cocaine. While the substance can be used to treat cancer and AIDS-related nausea, those issues also present complications in its abuse, Yaffe says. But despite marijuana still being on the banned substance list, the substance is still legally available for prescriptions today. Yaffe and other researchers are also testing whether MDMA, commonly used as a recreational drug in the early 1990s, has a similar effect as marijuana on the brain, and if so, if it has any therapeutic value. "When MDMA was first used in this area, there were people who were very concerned; it caused seizures, euphoria was quite strong, mood swings, and	0
"My husband and I were in a situation where we had to choose between keeping our marriage together, and keeping our careers and our families," she said. "We chose a career every couple of months, and I chose to keep working, because I love to work." "The fact that I was married to him all these years and he wasn't working — that hurt," she added. She said it took years to heal the pain caused by what she called a "bad divorce." The American Association of University Women estimates that 42 percent of all American families are already headed by men who work at the top of their fields. The report found that there is a significant income disparity between men and women who are married to those in the same profession, in part because women are still paid 77 cents for every dollar a man earns. That means in the United States, for every additional $500 a woman brings home, the man receives only 72 cents.	0
The next chapter of the KOF XIV storyline is starting soon! After more than 8 months of planning, KOF XIV's development team has finally completed the game that players have been waiting for: the last match of the New Year's Week tournament, and that is going on from November 8th to the 30th! And as the story continues on, the KOF XIV Development Team is finally looking for the community's support, making this tournament possible. The New Year's Week tournament, which became a great success, is going to end in less than a month's time. KOF XIV, in this event, will give players an opportunity to enjoy the best of the fighting game genre in an even more exhilarating environment! The first part of the battle between KOF XIV's development team and an external team of programmers for the game's storyline is starting now! It's a very special moment for us, as it marks our first collaboration. From this event, we want to show the world that we value and respect the cooperation between developers that we have found very impressive, and we look forward to even bigger collaborations in the future. With the New Year's Week tournament ending, it's time to focus on the events that will be coming up in the future, as well as the last tournament of the current season: the KOF XIV Championship Festival! This event will be held in December, from 16th to 22nd at the Tokyo Dome of the Nichinan Culture Park, and all tournament matches will be live-streamed on Twitch. This last match of the current season is already starting! It's going to be something that never happened before: both teams will be in their own tournament, competing for the KOF King of Fighters Tournament World Championship, as well as competing with other players from around the world! There are a total of 14 rounds throughout the season, with many top players from around the world participating in the event! The tournament starts this week. There will be 2 rounds each day, starting on Friday, Dec. 6th and finishing on Monday, Dec. 9th. All matches are scheduled to be streamed from the event in Tokyo Dome. The matches will be casted by our experienced gaming crew, along with two hosts from KOF XIV, and various commentators and analysts. If you are not already a member of the KOF XIV community, you can already tune in to this match: here. With such a great event happening in Japan for a very interesting game, we decided to use this opportunity to release a new playable KOF XIV character, the newly confirmed Sakura Matata. This powerful character combines the magic and the sharpness of Sakura with her unique skills and unique fighting style. This character's name is Sakura Matata, Sakura means "blossoming beauty", Mato means "fire" (or "firefly", as in the manga), and "ata" is Japanese pronunciation of the word "matata", which means bright, bright light. As you're now seeing, our artists have worked their magic with all of the game's artwork to provide Sakura Matata with her final look! In the game, Sakura Matata is the leader of the "Lightside Faction" and a master swordsman. Her ability to use the flames that are inherent in her body allows her to attack from many angles while remaining hidden from her enemy. She is also a very accomplished fighter, being able to block her opponents attacks and dodge their attacks to surprise them, or attack their bodies while they're at a disadvantage! This is a new playable character in the game for you to show off, and we hope that you will do so. The game's story is already complete, so the main focus will now be on getting this event ready for you. Once again, to show you our support of all of our players and fans, we will keep running the New Year's Week tourney and the KOF XIV tournament events for at least another month. Thank you very much once again for your support and we hope to see you again this year!	0
 The second day after the Boston Marathon bombing revealed how close, how many, to the finish line the suspects crossed before they were caught. At approximately 2 and a half miles into the course and about a mile from the finishing line, surveillance video captured the suspects crossing the finish line and they were quickly apprehended. For the first time in more than five years, the Boston Police Department's bomb unit and SWAT teams, which had been deployed to the Marathon, were called in to assist. For those on-scene after the bombing on April 15, 2013, it was the last time the Marathon would be run at the moment. The following day, however, there will be a celebration, albeit a quieter one. The Boston College women's cross-country team will participate in the second meet of the 2013 season. Last year, when the men's cross-country team was eliminated from the playoffs with a fourth-place finish, this year's women's teams finished in fifth and seventh place, respectively. The men's program, after finishing the 2013 season with a silver medal, is now on hiatus as the men prepare to compete at the Olympic Trials in Austin, Texas, next spring. The men's team still has two more races – the 2014 Atlantic Coast Conference men's hockey finals, scheduled for March 2-5 at the TD Garden, and the 2014 men's NCAA hockey championship, scheduled for March 7-10 at the Capital One Arena in Washington, D.C. This past season, Boston College was one of the most successful programs in college soccer going through both the NCAA tournament and the NCAA field. The Eagles finished second overall in the Ivy League and made it to the NCAA semifinals before falling to eventual champion Harvard in the title match. Despite all of its success, the men of the team are not out of the game. In May, coach Jim Curtin hired Tommy Di Carlo as an assistant coach. Di Carlo, an assistant for the last three seasons, had been at the helm at Bowling Green for two seasons before that and was a graduate assistant at Boston University last season. He brings with him plenty of experience on a college soccer team. He coached the Bowling Green program for 12 seasons from 1992 to 2009. The biggest question this preseason for the Eagles is how Di Carlo will fit into the program now that he has joined Curtin's staff on a permanent basis. Curtin had previously stated how valuable Di Carlo would be this season for the program. "I've made it pretty clear to Tommy that Tommy is an incredibly experienced collegiate coach," Curtin said last season. "He's coached in our conference from the time we've been at it. I've coached against Tommy in both of our leagues. I've talked to him and I've been aware of his career. It just makes a lot of sense. Tommy is one of our head coaching candidates. I'm really glad he decided to play for our program; he had done so for the last eight years as a graduate assistant; one of our assistants from the day that Tommy got hired, he's been with us since the beginning. He's an excellent coach and a player as well. So he's somebody who I want on our staff, one of our head coaching candidates and, obviously, a member of our staff next year." It was reported, at the time, that this was Curtin's first choice for a head coach, but the timing of his hiring would seem a bit odd in light of the fact that Di Carlo, while familiar with the NCAA, is unfamiliar with the Ivy League which will again include Boston College. While Di Carlo is familiar with the coaching staff, the coaching staff's familiarity with his coaching career has been something that Curtin and the staff have been working to rectify. "The Ivy League is going to be a challenging league. It was probably tough for [Curtin] to get the [Men's] program moving back in the right direction. We've got a young and talented program and I think Di Carlo will provide a lot of stability and leadership and I think Tommy's arrival is going to provide that as well." The one thing Di Carlo didn't bring to Boston College was a national title, but Di Carlo did have at least one of those a year ago. Last year, Tommy Di Carlo, a former Boston University and University of Hartford student athletic trainer, led the Eagles to the NCAA Women's National Championship in College All-Star Weekend in Boston and then, after a second-round loss to topranked UCLA in the College Cup semifinals, the Eagles won the National Championship outright in the College Cup finale against Temple. He and his team had been through so much together. They were one of six teams in the nation who finished in the top eight in the final NCAA Soccer rankings in 2012. Tommy Di Carlo was a four-time all-conference performer during his collegiate career at Hartford but he was a three-time all-conference honoree at Boston University, including	0
New Hampshire police have found no evidence of a gunman on the grounds of the U.S. Open after a reported sighting in the area Monday afternoon, but the investigation into the incident continues. "It was a male in a vehicle, a dark-colored vehicle, at least the color of it, and he stopped and was talking to a police officer," said Capt. Kevin Miller of the New Hampshire State Police. "The man in the vehicle said he was in New Hampshire doing some business. He wouldn't give the officer's name, so the officer called 911," he said. "Right after we received the call, it was confirmed that it was an empty vehicle that was a sighting of someone with a firearm." "We are still searching for the person who was in this vehicle, and we do have a witness who spoke with that person," Miller added. State police received a 911 call from a man at 2:16 p.m. Monday, saying that a man was holding a weapon in New Hampshire. They also received another 911 call from someone who claimed to be the man. The witness, who was in New Hampshire, provided investigators with a license plate number, which led to the discovery of the empty vehicle. Miller said police had sent out a number of information-gathering teams to New Hampshire since Sunday when the first sighting of a man wearing a ski mask and wearing a bulletproof vest with black ski-type gloves was reported by the New Hampshire Sheriffs' Department. Officers with the New Hampshire State Police and the Manchester, New Hampshire, police were sent to each of three local police departments in New Hampshire -- Manchester, Concord and Lebanon -- over the weekend and conducted saturation patrols. Miller said investigators will continue to search the area around the Green Mountain Golf Course and surrounding countryside for any additional witnesses or vehicles that may be involved. "We would welcome any information as well that might provide details and help us with this investigation," Miller said. Anyone who may have been involved in the incident is asked to contact New Hampshire State Police at one of these numbers: 1-800-452-4321, Mon-Fri 7:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. and Sat. 10 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. or you may contact the Manchester Police Department at 761-631-2262.	0
